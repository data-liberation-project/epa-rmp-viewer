The Hilmar Cheese Emergency Response Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance of local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan which documents specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as notification of the local emergency response agencies which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to the ammonia refrigeration process are planned at this time. However, the process will be subjected to regular process hazard analyses reviews for the purpose of identifying and implementing potential improvements. Facility personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."

Under both of these programs, the facility has outlined specific procedures that it follows to prevent or minimize the release of anhydrous ammonia to the environment. Specifically, the facility has performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the ammonia system and will repeat this process at least every 5 years. The purpose of the PHA is to provide a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards associated with the ammonia system. In addition, the facility performs regular training of its employees to ensure that the procedures developed for the safe use and handling of ammonia is adhered to all the time. Finally, the facility has a regular inspection and maintenance program to ensure that the ammonia system is operated\nand maintained according to specific ammonia industry safety standards.\n\nIt is Hilmar Cheese's policy and belief that safe operating and maintenance practices and accident prevention programs are the key to obtaining safe operation and achieving accident prevention. \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nDate of Accident:     3/16/2023\nTime Accident Began:     0902 am\nRelease Duration:     23 minutes\nQuantity Released (lbs):     22 lb.\u0092s\nLiquid or vapor release:     Vapor\nSource: Pipe from the condenser right?

It is the policy of Hilmar Cheese to comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, and to conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any\nunreasonable adverse impact on the environment or its neighboring community.\n\nIn keeping with this policy, Hilmar Cheese has developed and implemented OSHs Process Safety Management and EPAs Risk Management programs to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community. The risk management program includes procedures: (1) to identify potentially hazardous chemicals at the facility, (2) for maintaining a safe working environment and, thereby, help prevent the release of hazardous chemicals and (3) for minimizing the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Hilmar Cheese facility makes dairy / cheese food products. The major processes at the facility include milk handling and storage, wet and dry ingredient mixing and product packaging for distribution. Raw materials are delivered to this facility by trucks. The only RMP regulated chemical handled by Hilmar Cheese at the Dalhart facility is anhydrous\nammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in the refrigeration system for cooling the building, cooling and freezing products. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.\n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25, the worst-case and alternate case release scenarios were calculated for the covered process at the facility and the results are held on file at the Hilmar Cheese facility.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHilmar Cheese, Dalhart facility"
