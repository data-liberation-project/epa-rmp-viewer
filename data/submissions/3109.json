These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. Smithfield Packing Co. program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage. \n\nSmithfield Packing Co safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels, which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.     \n\nSmithfield Packing Co safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices, which govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of Smithfield Packing Co.through training and documentation. \n\nSmithfield Packing Co.  is a pork slaughtering, processing and packaging company which utilizes approximately 130,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping area's.\n\nIn a Worst Case Scenario, failure of the high pressure r"

The vapor could travel as far as .23 miles. gasket ruptures in the flange was chosen as an alternative release because of its higher likelihood that it could occur.

The accidental release a occurred in 1996, which consisted of approximately 125 pounds of ammonia being released from a compressor after the bottom seal leaked. The leak was quickly contained. There was 1 injury, and no off-site receptors were affected. \n\nThe facility emergency response program is based on OSHA's Regulations for Emergency Action Plans (1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29CFR1910.120). Smithfield Packing Co. has an on-site trained emergency response team (HAZMAT) and maintains a written emergency response plan, which is reviewed annually. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee, Fire Department, Police, and Emergency Medical facilities to ensure communication with all potential or actual involved resources should their involvement be necessitated by a release.\n\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis, inspections, annual reviews, and audits, Smithfield Packing Co. continuously improves it's process system, procedures, programs, and training to ensure mitigation, control, technology, equipment, and organizational changes remain consistent and in force. Through this initiative, Smithfield Packing Co. can ensure the utmost safeguards are utilized as it relates to it's process system and programs for the overall safety and well being of the employees, facility, and the environment."
