Included are up to 25 million canisters of spray aerosol cans, each of which uses liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) propellant (CAS 68476-86-8).  This LPG mixture is a 69% propane / 31% isobutane mixture, and approximately 1 oz is in each canister.  Although LPG is not listed on the 112(r) or 40 CFR 68.130 list for flammable chemicals, both propane (74-98-6) and isobutene (78-28-5) are, and as the mixture is flammable, RustOleum has prepared a RMP plan to manage it as a flammable mixture(0-11-11). \n\n\n\nFor this RMP, Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA) for flammable mixtures were prepared, including both a worstcase and alternative scenario.  The worstcase scenario assumes that the propellant in each aerosol spray can ignites simultaneously in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE), combusting 5,340,000 pounds of LPG simultaneously, generating an overpressure endpoint of 1.4 miles away from the centroid of the warehouse building. Mitigating factors for fire walls, sprinkler systems, and the building itself are not factored.  Using 2010 US Census record data for the surrounding area, 133 census blocks are within 1.4 miles of the building, potentially exposing up to 6,019 people.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative scenario assumes that, as product is constantly shipped into and out of the building, only 90% of its full capacity is ever onsite, causing a potential simultaneous ignition of 4,807,268 lbs of LPG in a VCE.  While it is acknowledged that the warehouse's fire walls, sprinkler systems are mitigating factors, and the building itself would constitute an enclosure to contain a blast, RustOleum has not factored these mitigating factors into the OCA.  Using 2010 US Census record data for the surrounding area, 118 census blocks are within 1.35 miles of the building, potentially exposing up to 5,118 people.\n\n\n\nPublic receptor areas within both the worstcase scenario inclu"
