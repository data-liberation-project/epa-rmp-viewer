Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\r\n\r\n-  Monitoring and detection system to detect a hydrocarbon release.  \r\n-  The facility is manned 24 hours per day providing routine surveillance.\r\n-  Audible and visual warning alarms located throughout the facility warn of possible emergency situations.\r\n-  Testing of vessels and preventive maintenance through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\r\n-  Providing emergency shutdown buttons at various locations within the facility.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tFive-Year Accident History\r\n\t\r\n\tNo incident resulting in onsite injuries, death or significant property damage or known offsite impacts, such as death, injury, property damage, shelter in place, evacuation, or environmental damage from a flammable substance release has occurred at the facility within the last five years. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\t\r\n\tThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Conway LPG Stora"
