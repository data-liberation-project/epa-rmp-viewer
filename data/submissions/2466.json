( Ethox ) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Ethox established a system to ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Part of this system is a Risk Management Program that helps manage potential risks at Ethox and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One requirement of the rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at Ethox.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Ethox.\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEthox is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  A comprehensive accidental release prevention program is in place that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Ethox policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release does occur, Ethox is completely coordinated with Donaldson Center Fire Department which provides trained emergency response personnel to assist in the control and to mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility's primary activity is the manufacturing of Surface Active Chemicals.  There are two regulated substances present at the facility: Ethylene oxide [Oxirane] (EO) and Propylene oxide [Oxirane, methyl-] (PO). EO and PO are used for manufacturing detergents, emulsifiers and wetting agents. The maximum inventory in any one ves"

A number of processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at Ethox.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEthox maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Leader 2.3 process sections and deviations.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Ethox maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nEthox has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least annually and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEthox carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS). An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like Ethox.  An ARS helps the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At a distance less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely. People who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n \nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, Ethox has used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a rail car.  The scenario involves the release of 170000 lb. of Ethylene oxide [Oxirane] in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather"

The release rate is 6,000 lb/hr.  This release rate is set by the relief valve flow capacity.  The duration is 5 minutes.  The alternative release scenario is based on the relief valve opening from over pressurization due to excess nitrogen flow to the rail car.  In accordance with Ethox response procedures, plant personnel will quickly stop the nitrogen flow , allowing the relief valve to re-close.  The elevation is 13 feet to the top of an EO rail car.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.090 mg/L is 0.37 miles.\n\n\tThe alternative release scenario for PO involves a release from the relief valve opening on a PO Rail Car.  The release rate is 6,000 lb/hr.  This release rate is set by the relief valve flow capacity.  The duration is 5 minutes. The alternative release scenario is based on the relief valve opening from over pressurization due to excess nitrogen flow to the rail car.
