Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nBased on 2017 Compliance Audit, Mermentau Facility is NOT subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119). In addition, Mermentau Facility does NOT have process that is classified in one of the EPA listed NAICS codes as listed below:\n\n32211 Pulp mills \n\n32411 Petroleum refineries \n\n32511 Petrochemical manufacturing \n\n325181 Alkalies and chlorine manufacturing \n\n325188 All other basic inorganic chemical manufacturing \n\n325192 Cyclic crude and intermediate manufacturing \n\n325199 All other basic organic chemical manufacturing \n\n325211 Plastics material and resin manufacturing \n\n325311 Nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturing \n\n32532 Pesticide and other agricultural chemical manufacturing\n\n\n\nNote that the public receptors are located within the worst- case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Mermentau Facility is subject to Preventative Program 2 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. \n\nThe Mermentau Facility has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.\n\nThe Mermentau Facility does"

The most recent RMP reinstatement and recertification was completed in June 2012. The Facility added an additional natural gasoline tank, which increased the Facility storage capacity and triggered this RMP revision. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed for the process revisions in December 2017, and the expected date of completion of all changes from last PHA is December 2020. The following information serves as a complete RMP 5-year recertification.\n\n1.1 68.155(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies    \n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a policy of safe natural gasoline and butane handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the handling of flammable materials, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a butane or natural gasoline release.\n\n1.2 68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Mermentau Facility receives natural gasoline, n-Butane and isobutane via pipeline for storage and subsequent off-loading via barge. Although the current facility Material Safety Data Sheet for natural gasoline lists it as a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Class 3 flammable; subsequent testing completed by EnLink demonstrates that the mixture would, at times, be considered an NFPA Class 4 flammable based upon the flash point and boiling point of the mixture. As such, EnLink has chosen to include natural gasoline in the RMP-regulated inventory at the Facility. Natural gasoline may include the following RMP- regulated flammable substances: isopentane and n-pentane. The maximum inventory of natural gasoline at the Facility at a"

The largest vessel that stores natural gasoline has a capacity of 2,520,000 gallons (13,669,601 lbs).\n\nThe Mermentau Facility also receives n-butane and/or isobutane, which are regulated flammable mixtures. N-Butane is a flammable mixture that contains n-butane, pentane and isobutane; and isobutene is a flammable mixture that contains isobutane, n-butane and propane. N-butane and/or isobutane are stored interchangeably in one of three pressurized vessels. The maximum inventory of n-butane or isobutane at the Facility at any given time is 1,417,500 gallons (7,111,873 lbs). The largest vessel containing either n-butane or isobutane at the Facility has a capacity of 472,500 gallons (2,370,624 lbs).\n\n1.3 68.155(d) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of n-butane, isobutane and natural gasoline. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. Although, Mermentau Facility is classified as Program 2 facility, the Facility's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.
