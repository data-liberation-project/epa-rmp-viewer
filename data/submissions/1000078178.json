Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\nBased on 2017 Compliance Audit, Mermentau Facility is NOT subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119). In addition, Mermentau Facility does NOT have process that is classified in one of the EPA listed NAICS codes as listed below:\r\n32211 Pulp mills \r\n32411 Petroleum refineries \r\n32511 Petrochemical manufacturing \r\n325181 Alkalies and chlorine manufacturing \r\n325188 All other basic inorganic chemical manufacturing \r\n325192 Cyclic crude and intermediate manufacturing \r\n325199 All other basic organic chemical manufacturing \r\n325211 Plastics material and resin manufacturing \r\n325311 Nitrogenous fertilizer manufacturing \r\n32532 Pesticide and other agricultural chemical manufacturing\r\n\r\nNote that the public receptors are located within the worst- case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Mermentau Facility is subject to Preventative Program 2 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10.

The most recent RMP reinstatement and recertification was completed in June 2012. The Facility added an additional natural gasoline tank, which increased the Facility storage capacity and triggered this RMP revision. A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed for the process revisions in December 2017, and the expected date of completion of all changes from last PHA is December 2020. The following information serves as a complete RMP 5-year recertification.\r\n1.1 68.155(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\t\r\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains a policy of safe natural gasoline and butane handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the handling of flammable materials, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.\r\nThe Mermentau Facility has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a butane or natural gasoline release.\r\n1.2 68.155(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Mermentau Facility receives natural gasoline, n-Butane and isobutane via pipeline for storage and subsequent off-loading via barge.

As such, EnLink has chosen to include natural gasoline in the RMP-regulated inventory at the Facility.
