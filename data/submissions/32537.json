Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  In most instances, Heinz North America-KOP has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the Part 68 requirements, that information is contained in this document.\n\n\nCommitment to Safety:\n\nHeinz North America-KOP is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining a\"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n\nIt is the policy of Heinz North America-KOP to:\n\nProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\nComply with all federal, state, and local occupational health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\n\nProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\nEnsure, through training, and when necessary "

In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\nHeinz North America-KOP has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the Facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established and implemented regarding the ammonia refrigeration system process.  It is the responsibility of the designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\nThe first duty of Heinz North America-KOP employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Refrigeration Process\" and is contained in various vessels, cooling units, accumulators, piping, and"

Evacuation plans are placed throughout the Facility to inform personnel in an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia, or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the Heinz North America-KOP Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\nAs part of the facility's accidental release prevention program, training is conducted for employees and new hires.  Accidental release prevention, training and awareness are reinforced annually and as the operations at the facility dictates. Employees have received training in Hazardous Communication, Emergency Response, Spill Prevention, safe operations, maintenance, and emergency actions.  Heinz North America-KOP has specific operational and emergency procedures in place for delivery and handling of ammonia."
