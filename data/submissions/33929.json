      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESONSE POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of Indiana Packers Corporation (IP) to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community, and the environment.  IP's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out policies relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  IP has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent release of extremely hazardous materials.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in IP's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan (ERP) will be the guidance for responding to, containing, and reporting such releases.  The ERP includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  IP will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nIP is a pork processing facility.  Pigs are trucked in, slaughtered and processed for human consumption.  To preserve the meat and prevent bacteria contamination, two chemicals regulated by the RMP Rule, ammonia and chlorine, are used at the facility.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.  Chlorine is used to treat the water to kill bacteria.  Chlorine is injected into the water via a vacuum system.  When mixed with water, it is diluted to harmless concentrations.  However, the amount of chlorine present at the facility is below the threshold quantity that would require inclusion in the RMPlan.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nIP has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  IP has aggressively developed programs, policies, and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These pr"

Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high level awareness when working with hazardous materials.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no ammonia releases during the past five years that meet the reporting requirements of the RMP Rule\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize a  release, if one should occur.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e., fire department, police, rescue squad, etc.)  Drills are conducted quarterly for on-site response teams and bi-annually with outside organizations.  Although the Safety Director is the key 24 hour contact, Vice President of Engineering will be the contact should the Safety Director be unavailable.\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nFuture changes to improve release prevention include:\n\n- Systematic review of PSM/RMP programs and operating procedures\u00b7\n- Improved ventilation in the compressor room to afford better isolation of the adjacent engine room"
