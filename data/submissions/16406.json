      "SummaryText": "Bethlehem Lukens Plate Division ( BLP) Coatesville Operations, maintains a proactive role in managing RMP issues.  A Disaster Operations Plan, Crisis Communications Plan and Emergency Operations Plan are currently in place and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements for Emergency Response are incorporated in the procedures contained in these reports.\n\nThe \"worst-case\" release scenario is based on the total loss of Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) from the single largest vessel in the process which is the HF storage tank (there has never been such a release of this type at the facility).  If a catastrophic event were to occur, a total release of up to 49,690 lbs from the storage tank would be completely contained in a containment tank below.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the \"worst-case\" release of this  is 0.31 miles.\n\nSince there have been no offsite releases of HF at the facility, it has been determined from engineering and safety personnel  that the most likely alternative release scenario would occur if HF were released due to a transfer hose/pipe failure during an HF delivery.  A scenario of this type would result in the release of up to 33,126 lb of HF during truck unloading operations.  BLP has a passive mitigation system in place (dike) which would only partially contain the total quantity released in the truck unloading station.  The area of impact would be 0.81 miles from the unloading dock. \n\nBLP is currently redesigning  the passive mitigation systems relative to both scenarios to maximize containment of any release that may occur and to minimize the vaporization of HF to the atmosphere.  The intention is to  reduce the impact area due to either a \"worst-case\" or alternative release to the point where no offsite consequences would occur, based on EPA \"look-up\" tables.  A modified RMP will be submitted when these modifications are completed."
