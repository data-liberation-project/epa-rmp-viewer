      "SummaryText": "Bayer CropScience has a vision to provide innovative solutions meeting the needs of our customers in line with the global principles of Responsible Care and Sustainable Development. To meet our vision, we conduct our business with respect and care for the environment and without compromising the health and safety of people, whether employees, customers, or citizens around the world. Facility and organization management fully supports the implementation of process safety at the plant. It is our policy to proactively implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases. If such a release does occur, our first concerns are for the safety of our employees, the safety of the community, and the protection of the environment. Furthermore, it is our policy to work cooperatively with the local fire department on emergency response matters.\n\n\n\nThe facility produces cotton seed. Cotton seed is received from cotton gins, delinted and cleaned, treated, and then packaged for distribution to customers. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride, a regulated substance, is used in the delinting process. \n\n\n\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. Employees are trained to recognize the hazards of the process and all changes to the process are reviewed to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental consequences of the change are addressed prior to the implementation of the change. The facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM rule. The facility has added a water curtin as a migitation against a chemical release.\n\n\n\nThere have not been any accidental releases of hydrogen chloride over the last five years with offsite consequences. Nevertheless, the facility has an emergency action plan and written operating procedures that address emergency shutdown procedures. Evacuation drills are periodically conducted and the facility communicates regularly with the local fire department.\n\n\n\n"
