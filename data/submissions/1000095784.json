Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nIn preparation for submittal of this RMP, SSPWD has completed installation of the following changes to improve safety, make the site more sustainable and inherently safer:\r\n - SSPWD has discontinued the use of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) as a raw material. (HF is a regulated toxic material.)\r\n - SSPWD, as a result of the discontinuation of HF, produces a significantly less amount of anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride (aHCl) in-situ to the process.
