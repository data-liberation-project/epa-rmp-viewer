Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anyhdrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees,, the enviroment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and sale of fertilizers and othe agricultural products.  Anhydrous ammonia, which is used for manufacturing 10-34-0 fertilizer, is also received and stored at facility.  The maximum stored quanity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 320,000 pounds stored in two (2) 34,200 gallon rail tank cars or truck trailers.  The maximum fill level of each rail car or trailer is 85% of the total tank capacity.  The maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when both rail tank cars or trailers are located at the facility and are at the maximum fill level of 85%.\n\nApproximately once or twice each year, 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is maufactured by combinig anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a coverter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.

The maximum quanity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 160,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.. Theresulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/l) is 2.82 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, rail car is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anyhdrous annonia form a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hise during transfer of ammonia from the railcar.  The quanity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release of approximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.18 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental rlease prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process.\n\n1) Process Safety Information:  The process equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.

The process hazard analysis reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguard used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the process hazard analysis reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n3 perating Procedures:  Written operating procedures for the process are readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.  The operating procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary so that they reflect current practices and changes to the process or equipment.\n\n4)Training:  All operators of the process equipment participate in a training program.  Initial training consists of classroom type instruction that covers health and safety hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) uears.  The training program is reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\n\n5) Mechanical Integrity: A written mechanical integrity program is used to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment.  Each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment is trained in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks so that the employee can perform the tasks in s safe manner.  Inspections and tests are preformed on process equipment following recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.

Appropriate checks and inspections are performed so that equipment is installed and consistent with design specifications and manufacture's instructions.\n\n6)Management of Change:  Written procedures are used to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The written procedures address the following:  technical basis of the proposed change; impact of change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and, authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are trained and informed of the change prior ro start-up of the process or affected by a change in process.  Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordinly.\n\n7)Pre-Startup Review:  When modifications to a new stationary source or modified stationary source is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following:  construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate, for a new stationary source, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implementaed before startup; and, training of each employee involved in operating a process has been completes.\n\n8)Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be preformed at least once every three (3) years.

Investigation reports reports will be retained for five years.\n\n10)Employee Participation:  A written plan of action regarding employee participation is readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.  Employees participate in training programs and have access to information developed under the risk management program rule.\n\n11)Hot Work Permits:  Hot work permits are issued on an as-needed basis.  Hot work permits may be issued for general welding/fabrication purposes and electrical work.  Welding/fabrication and electrical work is completed by experienced personnel.\n\n12)Contracters:  If a contractor is needed to preform work on process equipment, information regarding the safety preformance of the contractor is obtained and evaluated.  Before access to process equipment is given to a contractor, the protocol is to inform the contractor about potential hazards associated with the process entrance and exit control and emergency responses activities.  Additionaly, the contractor must act responsibly.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or enviromental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they "
