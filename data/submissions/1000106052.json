Depending upon the magnitude of the ammonia discharge, the leak detection system may be initiated.  Prior to the lifting of the safety relief valves, the high-pressure switch located on the ammonia storage tank shall initiate an alarm to the DCS, that the system design pressure is being approached.\n\nThe fail-safe breakaway connections furnished for truck unloading, tank pump-out and vent balancing are designed to prevent ammonia leakage from the tank in the event that the connections are damaged due to truck collision or other means. Unloading of ammonia from tanker trucks will be attended by the delivery driver and a Plant operator during the transfer event.  The unloading station consists of a liquid fill line and vapor return line between the storage tank and tanker truck to properly equalize pressure during unloading.  Both lines are equipped with quick disconnect fittings and check valves that allow a safe disconnect in the event the truck pulls away from the unloading station prematurely.  Both lines are equipped with emergency shutoff valves that will allow the operator to manually stop the flow of ammonia.  Each emergency shutoff valve has a remote cable so that they can be operated at a safe distance from the truck.  The station is equipped with a level indicator that displays the level of fluid in the storage tank to prevent overfilling.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nMEC's Emergency Response Plan addresses ammonia incident response.  Plant personnel are trained to respond to leaks that can be managed by shutting off key emergency valves.

Plant personnel will receive training before being allowed to work on the system.\n\nThe ammonia systems are visually inspected once per shift on a 24-hour per day basis.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the ammonia system have been incorporated into the plant's operation.  The SOPs are written and posted in appropriate areas.  Personnel are trained annually on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures.  Personnel will receive training prior to being allowed to work on the Ammonia system. The facility coordinates an ammonia emergency response training exercise with the Mankato Fire Department and local hazardous material response team.  \n\nControl and monitoring of the equipment and instrumentation associated with the ammonia storage tanks, unloading area, and vaporizer skids is done by MEC's DCS system.  To protect system equipment and to minimize disruptions to plant operation, protective actions are automatically taken if certain system components malfunction.  The operator cannot intervene to cancel these actions because of the system design.  Protective actions include overload and shortcut protection for the vaporizer heater, over temperature cutout for the vaporizer heater, and fail close isolation valves associated with the Ammonia storage tank.  \n\nThe ammonia tank and vaporizer are located within a concrete pit to contain potential spills and leaks.  An ammonia leak in the vicinity of the storage and unloading area will be detected by the sensors.  If the ammonia concentration exceeds 50 ppm a high-level alarm is sent to the DCS.  If the ammonia concentration exceeds 250 ppm, a high-high-level alarm is sent to the DCS.  In either case, the operator must evaluate the situation, c"

Ammonia saturation pressure in the tank varies as a function of ambient air temperature, with two (2) 1x100% electric ammonia vaporizer units ensuring that a pressure of 60-75 psig is maintained at all times.  During periods of low ambient temperature, the pressure in the tank will drop to a minimum level at which point a vaporizer is used to maintain the temperature and thus the pressure in the tank.  The ammonia storage tank and vaporizers are located within a concrete containment pit. An ammonia supply line from the tank delivers the ammonia vapor through a pressure regulator to the ammonia supply header and then to each AFCU skid.  \n\nEach AFCU skid consists of dual air blowers and inlet air filters, ammonia/air-mixing chamber, air operated isolation valve, ammonia flow regulating valve, flow element, and flow transmitter.  The flow of ammonia into the HRSG is regulated by the NOx content in the combustion turbine exhaust gas stream, measured at points upstream and downstream of SCR Catalyst located within the HRSG. The ammonia concentration at the outlet of the AFCU is below the TQ limit.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment - PHA\nA PHA is performed on the ammonia system every five (5) years.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\nThe Mankato Energy Center (MEC) maintains one substance, anhydrous ammonia, on site in amounts exceeding the RMP rule threshold quantities. The listed RMP rule threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds.  MEC stores the anhydrous ammonia in an above ground storage tank with an administrative policy and safeguards to not fill the tank beyond 85% capacity.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at MEC as an air pollution control system additive, to minimize the formation of nitrogen oxides in combustion turbine flue gas emissions.  MEC is a combined cycle plant, consisting of two (2) combustion turbines with a heat recovery system and a steam turbine generator.  The combustion turbines are equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) device. The anhydrous ammonia tank, piping and associated equipment are addressed in this Risk Management Plan.  \n\nMEC is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard (codified in 29 CFR 1910.119) because it stores greater than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  As such, the facility is required to prepare a PSM plan.  The requirements of a PSM plan and RMP prevention program are essentially equivalent, and this RMP will also serve as the facility PSM plan.\n\nPlant Location\nMEC is located at 1 Fazio Lane, Mankato, Minnesota.  MEC is in Blue Earth County, just north of the current Mankato city limits in Lime Township, in the southwest A\u00bc of Section 31, Township 109N, Range 26W.  The site is located east of U.S. Highway 169, north of U.S. Highway 14, and west of County Road 5 (3rd Avenue).  The property immediately surrounding the power plant is used for industrial and business purposes.  \n\nAmmonia System Description\nAn ammonia unloading and storage system is composed of five (5) major components: an unloading station, ammonia storage tank, two (2) ammonia vaporizers, two (2) ammonia flow control unit (AFCU) skids, and two (2) SCRs.  \n\nOne (1) horizontal tank is provided for anhydrous ammonia storage.
