We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide\u0012s Responsible Care. requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0012s (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Union Carbide Institute Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces more than 500 millon pounds of specialty chemical products in its various operating unit.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Institute Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  Union Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at the Institute Plant:  \n\n7 Ethylene Oxide  \t\t\t\n7 Anhydrous Ammonia\t\t\n7 Ethylenediamine\n\nUnion Carbide handles and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP-regulated flammable substances at the Institute Plant:\n\n7 1,3-butadiene  \t\n7 Isopentane\t\t\t\n3\tKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPA\u0012s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified,"

      "SummaryText": "no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Substances\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThis scenario assumes an over- pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 354,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide as a gas to the atmosphere.  Written operating procedures and a high level shutdown device / alarm limit the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 89% (354,000 lbs.).  According to EPA\u0012s Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. \n\nThe following administrative control is used in this analysis:\n7 Inventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 89 percent (354,000 pounds). \n In addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Combustible Gas Detectors Interlocked to Sprinkler-Deluge System:  This system is designed to detect flammable vapors and to automatically activate the deluge system (water spray) to suppress flammable vapors.\n7 Double Wall Tank:  The tank has a secondary tank wall which is designed to contain a leak in the primary wall.\n7 Secondary Wall Leak Detection:  A sensor is designed to detect leaks between the primary and secondary walls of the tank.\n7 Mounded Tanks:  Earth-covered tanks minimize leaks and any effects on the surrounding community.\n7 Emergency Shutdown System:  A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the pumps, place transfer valves in fail safe position, and actuate the deluge system.\n7 Deluge System:  A water spray system is designed to help"
