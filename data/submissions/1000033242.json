This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \r\n\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe process used to produce Ineos  Green Lake products contain quantities of flammable or listed hazardous chemicals which require application of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required in OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 and the  EPA Risk Management Program (RMP).  INEOS management strongly supports Process Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program and recognises it as a good business practice as well as a good approach to protecting workers and the public from industrial operation hazards.  Ineos  Green Lake applies the basic principles of Process Safety Management and the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nIneos  has 8 EPA RMP regulated substances present at our facility above the threshold quantity.  These substances include; \r\n\tAcrylonitrile\r\n\tAmmonia\t\t\t\r\n\tButane\r\n\tPropylene\t\t\r\n\tPropane\r\n\tChlorine\r\n\tSulfur Dioxide\r\n\tHydrogen Cyanide\r\n\t\t\r\nAcrylonitrile is the end product of our process. Ammonia (anhydrous) and Propylene are utilized as raw materials in the production of Acrylonitrile.  Propane is an impurity in the Propylene. Butane is utilized in catalyst activation. Chlorine is utilized in water purification. Sulfur Dioxide is utilized as an inhibitor. A by-product of the Acrylonitrile process is Hydrogen"
