The Marathon Los Angeles Refinery is comprised of two separate operating areas (Wilmington and Carson) that were connected through pipeline as part of the Los Angeles Refinery Integration and Compliance (LARIC) project.  Because the two operating areas are physically interconnected, share a common owner, and are located on contiguous property, the Marathon Los Angeles Refinery is a single stationary source and the Risk Management Plan was consolidated to reflect that fact. The refinery processes approximately 363,000 barrels per day of crude oil to produce a variety of petroleum p"

The refinery contains hydrocracking, hydrotreating, fluid catalytic cracking, delayed coking, and alkylation processes.  \n\nThe two operating areas of the Marathon Los Angeles Refinery are described below:\n\n\n\n1. Wilmington Operations\n\n\n\nThe Wilmington Operations is located in the City of Wilmington, California and is located in an area that is zoned for heavy industrial use.  The 299-acre area is divided by Pacific Coast Highway with most of the facility located to the north of the highway.  Sepulveda Boulevard and the Kinder Morgan Energy Company bound the northern portion of the refinery with Alameda Street and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks to the west and the Dominguez Channel to the east.  The area south of Pacific Coast Highway is a triangle-shaped parcel that approaches Anaheim Boulevard to the south and is bounded by Dominguez Channel to the east, and by the Marathon Marketing Sales Terminal to the west.\n\n\n\n2. Carson Operations\n\n\n\nThe Carson Operations is located in the City of Carson, California and is located in an area that is zoned for heavy industrial use.  The site occupies a 650 acres area bounded by Wilmington Avenue on the West, Sepulveda Boulevard on the South, Alameda Street on the East, and East 223rd Street on the North.  The facility also includes the Watson Cogeneration Unit.  The Watson Cogeneration partnership is a wholly-owned subsidiary of TR&MC LLC a joint venture between Tesoro SoCal Cogen Company LLC and Southern California Edison.  The Cogeneration Unit burns natural gas to produce electricity, which is sold to the Edison grid.  Waste heat from the process is then used to supply steam to the refinery for process use.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the threshold quantities listed for regulated toxic substances in the RMP Rule, LAR handles two regulated toxic substances, which are hydrogen sul"

Additionally, several regulated flammable substances, such as hydrogen, propane, propylene, butane, pentane, etc. are present.\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Marathon Los Angeles Refinery (LAR).  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program.  In addition, the prevention program includes California specific elements as part of the CalARP Program 4 and CalOSHA PSM for refineries regulations. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nLAR provides for and encourages its employees and employee representatives to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation include participating as a team member of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Safeguard Protection Analysis (SPA) or LOPA, Hierarchy of Hazard Controls Analysis (HCA), Damage Mechanism Reviews (DMR) or Incident Investigation. \n\nOther LAR Employee Participation programs include the Stop Work Authority program associated with hazard reporting and response and the authority of Operations personnel to stabilize, slowdown or shutdown an operating unit based on an identified potential hazard.  \n\n\n\nA detailed description of the LAR employee participation process is provided in Employee Participation Standing Instruction (LAR-PSM-001), Stop Work Authority (HSS-202), and Authority to Stabilize, Slowdown or Shutdown and Re-start Operating Units (O-082).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLAR maintains extensive documentation that is used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response information is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) contained in Operating Manuals.\n\n\n\nThe refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).  The refinery also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety systems in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe refinery uses the HazOp (Hazard Operability) analysis methodology.
