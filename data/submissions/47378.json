The dates of the last  PHA updates are 02/27/04 and 04/14/00 for the HF Alkylation and Pretreater units, respectively.  The major hazards identified in Section 7.4.d. wereaddressed during the PHAs conducted for this process.  The safeguards identifed in Sections 7.4.e., f., and g. apply to both units with the following exceptions:  1) Process controls consisting of scrubbers, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, emergency power, rapid acid transfer (dump) system, and double seals on pumps in acid service apply only to the HF Alkylation unit. Vent only applies to the Pretreater.  2) Mitigation systems consisting of deluge system and neutralization apply only to the HF Alkylation unit.  3)  The video surveillance system used as a detection system applies only to the HF Alkylation unit.  There has been one incident in this process within the past 5 years involving a release of hydrofluoric acid which did not result in but could reasonably have resulted in, imminent and substantial offsite impacts.",

The dates for the last PHA's or PHA updates are 05/15/2003 and 07/06/01 for the Light Component Product Storage and Propane Storage & Transfer units, respectively.  The HAZOP methodology was used for the Light Component Storage PHA whereas a What-If/ Checklist was used for the Propane Storage & Transfer PHA. The major hazards identified in Section 7.4.d. were addressed during the PHAs conducted for this process.  The safeguards in this prevention program apply to both operating units with the following exceptions:  1)The fixed water spray system for mitigation only applies to the Light Componenet Product Storage unit whereas the deluge system only applies to the Propane Storage & Transfer unit.  2) Excess flow devices only apply to the Propane Storage & Transfer operating area.  3) Dikes only applies to the Light Componenet Product Storage unit.

Neither the VGO Hydrotreater nor the Amine unit contain a threshold quantity of a regulated substance. The dates of the last PHA updates are 03/27/03, 11/17/99, and 04/25/02 for the Isocracker, VGO Hydrotreater, and the Amine unit, respectively. The major hazards identified in Section 7.4.d. were addressed during the PHAs conducted for this process. The hazard of runaway reaction only applies to the Isocracker. The safeguards in this prevention program apply to all three units with the following exceptions: Process controls consisting of emergency power and inhibitor addtion only apply to the Isocracker. Further, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, quench system and remotely operated emergency depressuring and isolation valves only apply to the Isocracker and VGO Hydrotreater.  There have been no incidents in this process within the past 5 years involving the release of a RMP regulated substance which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, imminent and substantial offsite impacts.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources and efforts expended in accident prevention, including compliance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Management systems are in place at the Trainer Refinery to ensure safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes. Our accident prevention program includes maintaining updated operating procedures and practices as well as extensive personnel training on safety. We also have highly trained and well-qualified emergency responders onsite 24 hours a day ready to respond to control and mitigate an incident should one occur.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, PA processes raw crude oil into gasoline and other refining products including jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, heavy fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and sulfur. The LPG products consist of butane and propane which are both regulated flammable substances. The refinery produces and/or uses other regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, pentane, etc. In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes hydrofluoric acid, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide which are regulated toxic substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances is failure of a storage vessel resulting in the release of its entire content of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid with no administrative controls in place and the unit shut down for maintenance. Approximately every 3 to 4 years, the entire unit's inventory of acid is transferred into this vessel for about 30 days until maintenance is completed. In evaluating this WCS, the numerous safeguards and passive mitigation that are in place to prevent a release and to minimize any consequences wer"

The results of the WCS indicate that such a release would result in offsite impacts to public and environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for hydrofluoric acid is a failure of a small diameter drain valve on a suction line of a pump. A quantity of acid could be released over a 10-minute period before the operators isolated the leak. The elevated water deluge towers would be activated remotely to knock down vapors. The resulting vapor cloud could reach an offsite endpoint and nearby public receptors. This event was selected as a more realistic scenario for use in emergency response planning with the community.\n\nTwo (2) worst-case scenarios (WCS) were developed for flammable substances since these scenarios potentially affect different public receptors. \n\nThe first WCS for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a sphere containing a flammable mixture composed primarily of pentanes. Although there are numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to control and mitigate their consequences, no administrative controls were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. Therefore, the full vessel inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.

This event was selected as a more realistic scenario for use in emergency response planning with the community.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Trainer Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Trainer Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team as well as incident/near miss investigations. Information on the refinery's accident prevention program is available to all employees and they are encouraged to suggest improvements to any of the programs. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives to address process safety and employee safety issues. These activities include committees to promote and address both process and personal safety such as the Central Safety Committee, Joint Management Labor Health & Safety Committee, and PSM subcommittees. The committees typically consist of members from a b"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe limits of critical and key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location, and updating procedure is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, chemical reactivity/stability hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process units and operations, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific critical operating and key process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, and composition) as part of procedures for normal operations. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents including piping and instrumentation diagrams that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Train"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Trainer Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of highly experienced people who have operating, engineering, and safety expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive priority attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete or resolved. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Trainer Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains written procedures that address various "

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators for refresher training purposes and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. \n\nThe procedures are maintained and updated by the unit operating personnel to reflect comments from users and changes made through the management of change process. The procedures are reviewed annually to ensure they are current and accurate. Written operating procedures are readily available to all personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Trainer Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive fundamental training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives unit-specific training. This training provides the skills and knowledge required to perform the duties of a specific job in operations, and is provided to both New Hires who complete Fundamentals, as well as incumbent operators who are cross training on other jobs. Job specific training provides detailed instruction on the process and process equipment. This phase of training includes hands-on demonstrations (or simulations) of start-up, shutdown and emergency operating procedures. It also includes the review and practice of routine, job-specific tasks performed by the operator (e.g. drawing and testing samples). \n\nAfter operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests & skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can"

Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Trainer Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because most contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel and/or Contractor safety personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Trainer Refinery conducts a PSSR for new facilities or facility modifications to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system so that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nSafe work practices are audited to measure compliance with refinery procedures and regulatory requirements, and serve as a vital element in managing plant safety.  The Safe Work Practices Audit program consists of three (3) levels of auditing and is designed to ensure that the Refinery is operated and maintained in such a way that the safety and health of the employees, the community and the environment are properly protected. \n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Trainer Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, and other facility changes be reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes that are strictly procedural in nature are managed in a separate program. All changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage and control any new hazards and (2) verify that existing safeguards have not been compromised by the change.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. The investigation team's recommendations are tracked until they are resolved. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors when appropriate) who could be affected by the findings. The results of the investigation are retained for at least 5 years so that they can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help the accident prevention program to function properly, the Trainer Refinery conducts periodic audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.
