The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n1. Routine operator inspection.\r\n2. UV/IR detectors\r\n3. LEL/HAM (Hazardous Atmosphere Monitors).\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n1. Process relief valves that prevent vessel over pressurization.\r\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\r\n3. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases.\r\n4. Redundant equipment and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n1. Extinguishing systems.\r\n2. Trained emergency response personnel.\r\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g. hard hat, safety glasses, protective clothing).\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. The plant has not experienced any reportable accidents in this timeframe. Releases that did occur at the plant involving regulated substance were quickly contained and resulted in no deaths, injuries, significant property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.

The liquids are then separated from the gas stream and further split into an ethane/propane product and a light gasoline/condensate product and removed from the plant by pipeline. The remaining natural gas is also removed by pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe Texas City Extraction Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge, the Texas City Extraction Plant identified regulated substances and quantities kept on site. Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Texas City Extraction Plant are methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso pentane, and n pentane.\r\n\r\nBased on worst-case analysis, distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors. In addition, the facility is subject to the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management. Therefore, the Texas City Extraction Plant is subject to Program 3.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Texas City plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental re"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractor Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\nThe facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

      "SummaryText": "is information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, pressure) in the plant's Operating Procedures. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems. The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes material of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the HAZOP and What-if/Check list analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. OSHA and the EPA recognize these analysis techniques as approved methodologies for conducting PHAs. \r\n\r\nPlant PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering and safety expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestion for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.

Implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, are scheduled and resolved in a timely manner. All approved mitigations are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains written procedure that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. In addition, the site's operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to process equipment operating outside their upper and lower limits. Operating procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in op"
