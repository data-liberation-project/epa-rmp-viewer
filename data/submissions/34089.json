      "SummaryText": "In this wastewater treatment plant facility, we handle chlorine which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water or wastewater treatment chemical, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions for safe handling of chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Mountain Home Fire Department,  Alma Clark (Plant Supervisor), Johnny Moore (Water & Sewer Director), Baxter County 911 call-out to the affected population.  The Mountain Home Fire Department and Mountain Home Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehiles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Baxter County Offices of Emergency Services. \n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to treat the wastewater system by utilizing chemicals such as chlorine. Chlorine is received in individual one ton cylinders at the 537 Hicks Road location and stored until needed.  Chlorine is fed into the wastewater system by automatic feeders.  All cylinders operate on a vacuum system.  This vacuum system will prevent continual operation of the system if there is an increase or decrease in the operating pressure on the cylinders or lines.  Access to the site is restriced to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThis location has a scurbber system "

      "SummaryText": "in place that will activate when there is a release of chlorine and or sulfur dioxide from the feeder rooms, and the injection rooms.  The scrubber system will suck the toxic vapors through a tube system and then into the scrubber.  In the scrubber, the toxic fumes are neutralized with caustic soda. Also at this location is the vacuum system which is also determined to be effective in preventing samll amounts of chlorine from escaping upon a system failure.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 537 Hicks Road location is chlorine.  The maximum amount of cholorine that can be stored at this plant is 8,000 pounds. There will only be one cyliner (2,000 pounds) online at any one time.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine since the constructed system was put into place in August of 1998 and is in compliance with all applicable regulations for wastewater treatment facilities.  The scrubber system in conjunction with the automatic vacuum ststem, limits the amount (if any) of chlorine that excapes during operational periods. This wastewater treatment facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations."
