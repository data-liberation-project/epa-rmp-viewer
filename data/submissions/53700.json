(MeadWestvaco) owns and operates a pulp and paper mill located in Evadale, Texas. \n\nMeadWestvaco has determined that EPA's risk management program rule, in 40 CFR 68, applies to the mill because chlorine dioxide, a chemical generated and used onsite, is listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  Chlorine dioxide gas is generated in a R-10 generator, and dissolved in cold water to make a chlorine dioxide aqueous solution at a maximum concentration of 12.5 grams/liter.  The chlorine dioxide aqueous solution is pumped to two outdoor storage tanks, each with a capacity of 400,000 gallons.  From here, the solution is pumped to various points in the pulp bleaching process.\n\nA process that stores or handles an aqueous solution with a concentration greater than or equal to the threshold quantity (1,000 pounds [lbs] for ClO2) is regulated by the risk management program rule.  Each tank has a maximum storage capacity of 400,000 gallons of aqueous solution (41,640 lbs ClO2).  The maximum chlorine dioxide quantity stored exceeds the threshold quantity. Therefore, MeadWestvaco is required to comply with the risk management program rule requirements for the chlorine dioxide storage tanks.\n\nAccident release modeling, to define the areas affected by chlorine dioxide releases, was done.  The principle elements of the modeling approach were:\n\n? The evaporation rate of aqueous ClO2 solution from spills was conservatively estimated based on a thermal and mass balance method.\n\n? The distance to the ClO2 toxic endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp?.\n\n? The offsite impacts on the population and the environment were evaluated with LANDVIEW 6.\n\nThe worst-case scenario was the release of the contents of a chlorine dioxide storage tank.  Modeling showed that a 25 mile radius would be affected.  The alternative case release scenario was the release from a liquid chlorine dioxide pipe.  Modeling show"

      "SummaryText": "ed that a 0.4 mile radius would be affected.  In the history of this process, there has not been a release of the magnitude of either the worst case or alternative case scenario.\n\nThe mill also complies with OSHA's process safety management rule in 29 CFR 1910.119 for the chlorine dioxide system.  The mill has employees trained to respond to chlorine dioxide emergencies, per OSHA's rule in 29 CFR 1910.120.  An evacuation plan, which includes training, has been implemented per OSHA's rule in 29 CFR 1910.38."
