ONEOKA?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nONEOK Underground Storage Company owns and operates the Bushton LPG Storage Facility, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage facility located in Bushton, KS.  The principle function of the facility is third-party storage of LPG.  Incoming LPG is received via pipeline as well as from the Bushton Gas Plant adjacent to the storage facility.  Products are then stored in underground storage caverns.  From the storage caverns, products are sent to customers via outgoing pipeline.  Additionally, propane is loaded on trucks for distribution to customers.  The RMP flammable substances/mixtures stored at the facility are Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Refinery-Grade Butane, E/P Mix, Y-Grade, and Natural Gasoline.  There are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emerge"

      "SummaryText": "ncy Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by ONEOK.  These high standards include:\n\nA?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \nA?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\nA?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nA?    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Bushton LPG Storage Facility is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.    Part of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nA?    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in the combustion of hydrocarbon vapors by having a continuous flare. \nA?    Ensuring hydrocarbon vapor is removed and burned by installing degassifiers at the north and south brine systems.\nA?    Installing hydrocarbon gas detectors at every well at the storage facility.\nA?    Minimizing the potential for a catastrophic event by providing a fire monitor system at the pipeline area.\nA?    Installing security lighting and surveillance cameras to facilitate observation of the entire facility.\nA?    Minimizing the possibility of emergencies by manning the facility continuously.\nA?    Providing an evacuation alarm system in order to safely evacuate the facility during emergency situations.\nA?    Conducting periodic operational rounds to ensure problems are detected and corrected in a timely manner.   \n    \n\n    Five-Year Accident History\n    \n    In the past five years, there have been no releases of RMP-regulated substances that have resulted in onsite i"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Ellsworth and Rice County Sheriff Departments and the Bushton Fire Department.  The Bushton Manager, Storage Operations is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n    \n\n    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n    \n    Compliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n    \nA?    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\nA?    The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\nA?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\nA?    Incident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective measures are taken, if necessary, following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operatin"
