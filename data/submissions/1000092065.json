The facility is located at 6535 Caballero Boulevard in Buena Park, California, which is approximately 1.3 miles west of Interstate 5, and 0.55 miles north of Highway 91. PP Tango CA, LLC, and its agents is responsible for implementation of the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program inside the Engine Room (Machinery Room). The two property tenants (Simply Fresh, LLC and True Fresh) adhere to the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program requirements and are responsible for implementing the PSM/RMP/CalARP requirements in their respective areas outside of the Engine Room. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial, industrial, and residential areas. The facility location with respect to the surrounding area is shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\nThe facility consists of a warehouse storage building of approximately 140,000 square feet.  The building is cooled via an ammonia refrigeration system that maintains a maximum of 12,688 pounds of ammonia.  Figure 2 shows the layout of the 6535 Caballero Blvd facility.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again.  The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the cooling and storage of fresh food products.\r\n\r\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (i.e. lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature).  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia and discharged to the atmosphere as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical"

      "SummaryText": "operating conditions range from 6 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 170 psig on the high side. \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Evaporative Condensers (3) to the High Pressure Receiver.  The High Pressure Receiver feeds high pressure liquid ammonia to the High-Temperature Liquid Pump Recirculator (LPR-H1), the Intercooler, and 8 high temperature evaporators (Dock and Coolers 5 and 6).  High pressure liquid ammonia is also sent to the High Temperature Compressors HC2 and HC3 and the Booster Compressors BC1 and BC2 for liquid injection oil cooling.  It also receives transfer liquid from the Liquid Transfer Unit (LTU-1).\r\n\r\nThe LPR-H1 supplies pumped liquid to 17 evaporators located in Cooler Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. The rooms serviced by these evaporators range from 35&#61616;F to 45&#61616;F.  The evaporators use fans to blow air across the coils, which transfer heat from the room to the ammonia inside the coils.  As this occurs, the ammonia partially vaporizes (boils) as it absorbs heat from the product and room.  The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) is returned to the LPR-H1.  In the vessel, the vapor (high stage suction) is drawn from the top by the High Stage Compressors HC2 and HC3.  The LPR-H1 also supplies high temperature recirculated liquid to the Low-Temperature Liquid Pump Recirculator (LPR-L1).  \r\n\r\nThe LPR-L1 supplies pumped liquid to six (6) evaporators located in the Freezer (-15&#61616;F).  The ammonia, flowing through coils located within the evaporator units, partially boils as it removes heat from the product and room.  The resultant liquid/vapor mixture from each evaporator in the Freezer is routed back to the same vessel.  The liquid drops to the bottom of the vessel and is transferred to the Liquid Transfer Unit LTU-1 and the vapor (low stage suction) is drawn from the top by the Booster Compressors BC1 and BC2.  \r\n\r\nExcess liquid ammonia from the Liquid Transfer Unit LTU-1 is"

The booster discharge is cooled as it circulates through the high pressure liquid make-up bath in the Intercooler.  The high stage suction is then pulled by the High Stage Compressors HC2 and HC3. \r\n\r\nThe compressors (two-stage) maintain a constant pressure in the respective liquid pump recirculator vessel based on the suction setpoint.  There are two booster compressors (BC1 and BC2) that collect low pressure vapor (6.2 psig) from the LPR-L1.  Discharge from the booster compressors (50 - 65 psig) flows to the intercooler where it is dispersed below the liquid level.  The Intercooler serves to cool the super-heated vapor from the Booster Compressors BC1 & BC2 prior to the second stage of compression at the High Stage Compressors HC2 and HC3.  These compressors pull medium temperature vapor (50 - 65 psig) from the Intercooler and LPR-H1. The hot gas (high stage compressor discharge - 150 psig) is delivered to three condensers (1 not in service), where latent heat in the ammonia vapor is discharged to the atmosphere, causing it to condense.  Hot gas is also used for defrosting the evaporator coils on an automatic timed cycle, to transfer liquid from the Liquid Transfer Unit LTU-1 to the High Pressure Receiver, and to cool the glycol in the Glycol Heat Exchanger.  \r\n\r\nThe Glycol Heat Exchanger is designed to be used in a separate, closed loop system for underfloor heating.  The Glycol Heat Exchanger receives hot gas discharge from High Stage Compressors HC2 and HC3.  As the high temperature ammonia vapor passes through the heat exchanger unit, it is partially condensed as the glycol absorbs heat from the ammonia.  The resulting 'wet suction' (liquid/vapor mix) flows to the LPR-L1."

For example, the facility operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Al"

      "SummaryText": "so, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from over pressurization.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation (November 10, 2020), revealed that there have been no releases in the past five years (November 2015 to November 2020) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. \r\n\r\nHowever, on 1/28/2019 there was a small ammonia release of <100 lbs of ammonia at the True Fresh evaporator resulting from a forklift impact.  There were no reported injuries resulting from the release. See the incident investigation forms at the facility for more details on the ammonia incident. \r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tsave lives;\r\n\u00bf\tminimize and avoid injuries;\r\n\u00bf\tprotect the environment; and\r\n\u00bf\tminimize property damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the CalARP regulations.  \r\n\r\nThe two property tenants have personnel circulate throughout the plant, taking note of unusual conditions in any portion of the system.  In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Emergency Coordinator.  The Emergency Coordinator will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem."
