      "SummaryText": "OK FOODS, Inc.\nFort Smith, Arkansas\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nExecutive Summary\n\nOK Foods is a chicken processing and products manufacturing company that utilizes anhydrous ammonia in a closed-circuit refrigeration system to chill and freeze the product prior to distribution.\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nO.K. Foods has established programs, procedures and safety devices to prevent exposure to personnel, community, the surrounding environment and to protect property assets.  Policies have been created to comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulations.  O.K. Foods strives to prevent potential releases through training and evaluation of policies, programs and procedures.  \n\nOK Foods emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  We work in conjunction with the Fort Smith Fire Department to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe primary purpose of the facility is the processing of poultry products, in which one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, is used above the threshold level.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the primary means for refrigeration, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our the main receiver tanks.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors. \n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(S) AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(S).\nWorst-case Scenario - the facility has an ammonia high pressure receiver (Plant 2) as the single largest ammonia vessel. Part 68.25(b)(1). The liquid-full capacity of the high-pressure receiver\nis 547 cubic feet. Considering the vessel is 80% full and using the\nammonia condensing temperature of 95 degrees yields an\napproximate operating pressure of 181 psig and an"

      "SummaryText": "ammonia liquid\ndensity of 36.67 pounds per cubic foot. The calculation of 547\ncubic feet multiplied by the liquid density yields the ammonia\ncapacity of 16048 pounds. Using RMP Comp with the settings of\nammonia liquefied under pressure, rural topography, and no passive\nmitigation the distance to endpoint is 1.5 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u0096 The alternative release scenario of\na pressure relief valve activation has been chosen. Part\n68.28(b)(2)(iv). Pressure relief valve activations historically have\nbeen a common release type within the industry. The largest\npressure relief valve at this facility was chosen for the scenario.\nThis valve has an inlet port size of 3/4\u0094 and an outlet port size of\n1-1/4\u0094 and discharge flow rating of 98 pounds per minute (air\nrating) at a pressure setting of 150 psig. The actual release rate\nwould be less for ammonia depending on specific conditions at the\ntime of release. The typical release duration may not reach the\nproperty boundaries of this facility, though EPA requires the\nalternative release scenarios to reach the boundary. The chosen\nrelease duration of 30 minutes in a urban setting to yield a\ndistance to endpoint of 0.1 miles which should exceed the property\nboundary at this facility.\n\n\n4. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThis OK Foods Fort Smith facility has not had an incident in the five years.\n\n5. THE RMP MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nOK Foods RMP program use outside entities or organizations including the Sebastian County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team.\n\n6. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nOK Foods facility complies with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations including the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule.  All personnel are trained about this during our Hazard Communications Training and through access to our Written Programs.  Maintenance and Refrigeration operators receive On-The-Job (OTJ) training.

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOK Foods works, as applicable, with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Fort Smith Fire Department and HAZMAT team on emergency preparedness.  Periodically meetings are conducted to address any changes in the facility or any new concerns.  \n\n8. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOK Foods trains and tests all refrigeration technicians.  The Process Safety Management Program is reviewed and updated, which is improved continuously through updates of our written program and training of our technicians."
