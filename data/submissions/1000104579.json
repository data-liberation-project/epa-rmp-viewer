(MarkWest), owner and operator of the Tornado Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \r\n\r\nThe Tornado Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system. Produced natural gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catcher which separates condensate from the natural gas stream. The gas stream is then compressed, dehydrated to remove any water, and is then sent to an expander where the temperature is reduced. Ethane and heavier liquids are separated from the methane gas stream. The liquids are then stabilized using a de-methanizer to remove any methane entrained. The methane is then sent to a sales pipeline and the natural gas liquids (NGLs) are pumped into a product pipeline for sales. Condensate is stored in tanks and trucked out of the facility. \r\n\r\nThe products at the Tornado Gas Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\r\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release"

The worst case and alternative case radii to endpoint were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In evaluating the worst-case and alternative-case scenarios there were no administrative controls or mitigation measures taken into account to reduce potential off-site impact. Populations within each radius were determined using the Missouri Census Data Center.\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios.  Results of the worst-case release scenarios indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements.  Details of the worst-case release scenarios and alternate release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. This summary addresses each of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program since the process at the facility that is regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation is also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information \r\n\r\nMarkWest keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents. The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\r\n\r\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \r\n\r\nMarkWest has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nMarkWest will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA). HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation mea"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention. Approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures \r\n\r\nMarkWest maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, startup after a turn around, and initial startup of a new process.
