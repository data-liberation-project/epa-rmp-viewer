      "SummaryText": "The City of Flint Water Pollution Control Facility (WPCF) is a municipal wastewater treatment plant located at G-4652 Beecher Road, Flint, Michigan. The facility includes two processes using RMP substances: chlorination and dechlorination.  \n\n\n\nThe chlorination process is the final stage of wastewater treatment before the effluent is discharged to the Flint River.  Chlorine is added to the wastewater in the chlorination process as a disinfectant. Historically, the facility drew liquid chlorine from the cylinders and evaporated the liquid for further use in the chlorination process.  The facility recently modified the chlorination system to draw chlorine gas from the cylinders. This modification eliminated the need for the evaporators. Elimination of the liquid handling systems improved process safety.\n\n\n\nPrior to the discharge of the effluent to the river, excess chlorine in the wastewater is removed in the dechlorination process.  Sulfur dioxide is added to the wastewater in the dechlorination process to facilitate chlorine removal.\n\n\n\nWPCF receives chlorine and sulfur dioxide in one ton cylinders and manages both substances in amounts above the respective RMP thresholds.   The facility is also subject to the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Modeling assessments of the worst case release scenarios for chlorine and sulfur dioxide indicate the potential for offsite impacts. Due to these factors, Flint WPCF is subject to Program 3 Prevention Program requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are both listed as toxic gases in the RMP regulations. The regulations specify that the worst case scenario for toxic gases must be based on the release of one complete container over a 10 minute period.  The consequence analyses for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide assumed the release of an entire on ton cylinder over 10 minutes or 200 pounds/minute.\n\n\n\nThe facility's most recent Process Hazard"

      "SummaryText": " Analyses (PHA) for chlorine and sulfur dioxide identified the most likely release scenarios to be associated with breakage or disconnection of tubing or piping connected to the cylinders containing the liquid materials.  The facility's PHA process allows for participation of employees and identification of opportunities for improvement at the plant.  The alternate release scenarios reported in this RMP reflect the PHA assessment. \n\n\n\nThe chlorination and dechlorination processes at Flint WPCF are both RMP Prevention Program Level 3 process. Both processes rely on the Process Safety Information, Operating Procedures, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work Permit, Contractors and Management of Change provisions of the facility's PSM documentation for its RMP Prevention Program to ensure consistency between the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP requirements.\n\n\n\nAs described in the training section of the PSM document, each employee with job responsibilities associated with the storage, handling or use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide is thoroughly trained or otherwise deemed competent in the work procedures relevant to their responsibilities. Employee participation is also a key component of the successful implementation of the PSM program at the Flint WPCF.\n\n\n\nThe PHAs performed for the facility also include a review of the five year accident history. During the past five years, Flint WPCF has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide that met the criteria of 40 CFR 68.42(a). \n\n\n\nFlint WPCF has been actively involved in emergency response planning. They have worked closely with the Genesee County Local Emergency Management Agency to develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for offsite response. The Flint WPCF Emergency Response Plan outlines procedures for internal response to releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide and notification and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of a release with potential impac"
