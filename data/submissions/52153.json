The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nCivic Center Properties maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and Nevada's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) regulations.\n\nCivic Center Properties has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Civic Center Properties to evacuate all employees (including employees of warehouse tenants) and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available 24 hours per day for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Civic Center facility provides cold storage warehouse space for distribution and for private tenants.  The facility is located at 3840-A N. Civic Center Drive in North Las Vegas, Nevada bordering the Interstate 15 freeway, south of Craig Road.  The immediate area is primarily light commercial and industrial. The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, s"

The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver (TS-1) to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR-1).  TS-1 is a reservoir used mainly as a liquid ammonia supply for cooling compressor oil.  HPR-1 serves as the main storage vessel for the system with the ability to store the entire inventory of ammonia.  It supplies liquid ammonia to the High Temperature Recirculator (LR-1) which pumps the cold liquid to the dock and cooler evaporators (13). The liquid ammonia expands as it enters the various evaporator coils, reducing the temperature.  These evaporators are used to maintain low air temperatures for cooler rooms, the loading dock, packing, and curing areas. As the air is chilled by the evaporators, the ammonia is partially vaporized and returned to LR-1, which maintains a liquid/vapor mixture of ammonia at 33 psig.\n\nLR-1 also routes ammonia liquid to the Low Temperature Recirculator (LR-2), which maintains a further reduced pressure (and hence temperature) of 3.6 psig.  LR-2 supplies cold pumped liquid ammonia to the Blast Freezers, the -10?F Freezer, and the Dual Temperature Room and collects the resulting two-phased ammonia (suction).  As liquid ammonia collects in LR-2, it is drained into a transfer drum (LTD-1) (which is pressurized with hot gas) that pumps the liquid back to the Thermosyphon Supply pipeline.\n\nThe Low Stage Compressors (LS-1 and LS-2) and the High Stage Compressors (HS-1 and HS-2) pull this low pressure ammonia vapor from LR-2 and LR-1, respec"

The condensers (EC-1 and EC-2) convert compressor discharge (hot gas) into high pressure liquid using a combination of fans and a water spray, and recycle it to the Thermosyphon Receiver.  Hot gas is also used for defrosting the evaporators on a timed cycle.\n\nThe system is also equipped with a dilution tank (DT-1) and an Emergency Control Box.  All of the relief valves are set to vent at 250 psig and discharge into a common header that vents into the bottom of the dilution tank, which is kept full of water.  In addition, the pressure in the system can be reduced manually by the valving located inside the Emergency Control Box located outside the Engine Room door. This control box allows the Fire Department to transfer ammonia from one vessel to another or vent the ammonia into the water dilution tank.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Civic Center Properties ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Civic Center Properties facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation, and Nevada's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\nThe Civic Center Properties facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of an ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage an"

All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince the initial Hazard Assessment (January 3, 2001), there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCivic Center Properties has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

Civic Center Properties plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis and the Pre-Startup Safety Walkthrough provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Civic Center Properties facility located at 3840-A N. Civic Center Drive in North Las Vegas, Nevada.  Many of the recommendations are complete and implemented as of the system startup date.  The facility has also implemented a majority of the recommendations from the 2004 Three Year Compliance Audit.\n\nIn addition, the facility is planning to complete several items over the next year to help with their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for Civic Center Properties employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management Program.\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining the above mentioned safety programs via the facility's Employee Participation program.\n3.  Continue internal and external safety audits / inspections and implement changes as needed."
