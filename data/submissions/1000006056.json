We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nIt is our policy to:\n\n\tComply with all applicable laws, regulations, and standards.                                                                                           \tReview and assess our operations for the purpose of making health, safety & environmental improvements.\n\nOur complete Heath Safety & Environmental policy statement, signed by our plant manager, is posted in the lobby of our facility. \n\nWe use a combination of prevention programs and emergency response planning, which are described later in this document, to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. Our Senior Site Manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring that our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  To ensure that our risk management program is appropriately developed and implemented, our Senior Site Manager has assigned the role of RMP coordinator to a staff member with the background, training, and experience necessary to manage the program. The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Senior Site Manger, is responsible for coordinating the development, implementation and integration of the RMP elements as is required under Section 68.15 of the RMP rule. \n\n2.\tThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nDue to the fact the polyurethane seating line has been idled and TDI has been removed f"

Therefore, the worst case scenario would be the rupture/leakage of a drum which would be contained within the facility and would not affect residential areas. \n\nThe primary purpose of the Woodbridge \u00c2\u00bf Brodhead facility is to produce polyurethane foam seat cushions for the automotive industry. The foam is made by high pressure mixing of chemicals immediately prior to pouring the mixture into a mold that is attached by carrier to a continuously moving line. The mold moves through a curing oven. Upon exiting the oven, the foam pads are removed from the mold, crushed, trimmed and prepared for shipment to customers. Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by EPA\u00c2\u00bfs risk management program rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam. TDI is received at the plant by railcar and tanker truck. It is stored in four tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room. The TDI is then transferred to the process utilizing a computer-controlled system. \nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors. The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 576,000 pounds.  Note:  The polyurethane seating line which uses TDI has been idled as of 4/9/2009.  Therefore, TDI in the time being has been removed from the facility as of 5/15/2009.\n\n3.\tOff-site consequence analysis scenarios \n\nEPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release and alternative release scenario\u00c2\u00bfs for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.  \n\nThe methodology used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint was Aloha version 5.3 software for plume modeling.  Atmospheric conditions were obtained from the NCDC for the Monroe Mun"

Monitors are used in the process and storage areas to constantly check for any leaks, and a visual system is in place that allows remote inspection of tanks.  As well, a buddy system is used in the unloading and tank farm areas to aid in accident prevention.\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we conduct business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n5.\tFive?year accident history. \n\nWe have not had any TDI releases that qualify for listing in the EPA\u00c2\u00bfs required five-year accident history report.  We have had six small releases of TDI in the past five years. Each release occurred inside the facility buildings with two resulting in minor injuries, two resulting in property damage and zero having an environmental impact.  A thorough and complete investigation of each of these releases was conducted in accordance with our accident/incident investigation program, root cause was determined, and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\n6.\tThe emergency response program.\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provided essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. We have coordinated our program with the local emergency planning committee and the fire department. A representative of the fire department routinely visits this plant to discuss how to respond to a release of TDI.  We have also given local hospitals information regarding medica"
