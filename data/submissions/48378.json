This activity includes processing of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is received andprocessed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The emergency procedures for Salina are coordinated with the Saline County LEPC.\n\nUnited Suppliers, Inc. - Salina, Ks has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Salina is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The following briefly describes the prevention program elements in place at this stationary source:\n\nProcess Safety Information:  The facility maintains information describing the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Studies are conducted to ensure the hazards associated with process operations are identified, understood and controlled.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written operating procedures are maintained for covered process operations.  The Contractors procedures address the following activities:   initial startup, normal, temporary, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround.\n\nHot Work Permits:  In order to assure adequate controls are used in work where conditions could cause ignition or fl"
