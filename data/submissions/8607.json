The facility observes safety precautions in handling ammonia to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment, and adheres to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which the facility handles ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the Valdosta Fire Department.  This includes procedures for notifying the Fire Department in the event of an accident involving ammonia.\n\nb. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility consists of an oilseed processing plant, a vegetable oil refinery, and a refined oils packaging plant.  The regulated substance used at this facility is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as refrigerant at the facility's refinery and packaging plant.\n\nc. Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: As a worst-case scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of the single largest ammonia vessel (the accumulator) is released as vapor over a ten minute period.\n\nAlternative Scenario: A more realistic release scenario involving ammonia would be a slow vapor release from the receiver resulting from a transfer hose failure.\n\nd. Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training for employees.\n\ne. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving ammonia that require reporting under EPA's Risk Management Rule.\n\nf. Emergency Response Program\n\nEmergency response at this facility is coordinated with the Valdosta Fire Department, such that in the event of an accident, immediate emergency response"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAs a result of a safety review of this facility's ammonia refrigeration system, the facility is planning to install spring loaded valves on the compressor oil drains, install auto shutoff valves on the liquid line out of the high-pressure receiver, add relief valves to the barometric exchangers, and install dual relief valves on the votators."
