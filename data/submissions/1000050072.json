      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - THE RANCH WINERY\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nE. & J. Gallo Winery operates the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems at The Ranch Winery facility and has established a Risk Management Plan according to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) regulation and the EPA's regulations (40 CFR Part 68) to enhance the already existing safety programs.  The Ranch Winery is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  The systems are maintained by trained staff and certified consultants and contractors.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System, that contains the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, is used for chilling wine and for cooling down wine storage tanks and maintaining them at a cold temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nSafety of the workers, neighbors, and customers and environmental health come before productivity and profitability. This is the uncompromising policy of E&J Gallo Winery, dba The Ranch Winery. This policy is realized through the implementation of a comprehensive set of safety programs that embrace all winery activities and relevant regulations.\n\n\n\nIt is also the policy of The Ranch Winery to act expeditiously and properly in case of an accidental adverse event to ensure that lives are saved, injuries are avoided, environmental health is protected, and property damage is minimized. This policy is realized through the implementation of an emergency action plan. \n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThere is one Ammonia Refrigeration System that uses ammonia at this facility. The refrigeration system is single stage, comprised of compressors, evaporative condensers, receivers, and several other components that may include pumped recirculators, accumulators, wine chillers, glycol coolers, wine tank jackets, piping, valves and automatic control devices.  The Ammonia Refrigeration System contains an"

Vaporization of ammonia at different points of the system provides the needed cooling effect.\n\n\n\nIn the case of pumped recirculators, liquid ammonia is pumped from a recirculator to various tank jackets, wine chillers or other cooling points.  The desired cooling effect is obtained by controlled vaporization of liquid ammonia.  Vaporization is achieved by either passing the liquid ammonia through a narrow passage (an expansion valve) or by controlling the pressure (which in turn controls the vaporization rate) of a flooded heat exchanger.  From these loads, ammonia vapor (which is often mixed with liquid ammonia) returns to the recirculator. The recirculator acts as a separator. The liquid from the returned ammonia accumulates at the bottom of the recirculator, from where the pumps take suction. The vapor in the upper part of the recirculator gets drawn by the compressors.\n\n\n\nAccumulator type cooling system works essentially the same as pumped recirculators. Liquid ammonia, under gravity enters the heat exchanger. By controlling the pressure in the accumulator and heat exchanger, the temperature of the ammonia is controlled which provides the cooling medium.\n\n\n\nThe compressors pressurize ammonia vapors and consequently ammonia gas heats up. The discharge of the compressors passes through the evaporative condenser, where cold water on the external side of the cooling tubes causes the ammonia temperature to drop below its condensation point and causes the ammonia gas to turn into liquid. The liquid from the evaporative condenser collects in the receiver.\n\n\n\nAs the refrigeration system operates, the liquid level in the recirculator or accumulator drops. The lost ammonia is replenished by the liquid in the receiver. The level switches on the recirculator or accumulator cause the automatic control valves to open and allow liquid ammonia into the receiver.\n\n\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration Systems are equipped w"

The compressors are equipped with shutoff mechanisms based on pressure (high and low) and temperature. Relief valves are installed on all the vessels and compressors. The system is also equipped with an ammonia dump station, which allows in case of an emergency, for the ammonia vapor to be safely drained from the system.\n\n\n\nThe system is controlled automatically and under normal conditions there is little need for the operators to intervene with the operation of the system. The operators, however, check the system regularly and provide the needed test, inspection, and maintenance activities. All elements of the system are subjected to a periodic inspection, testing, and preventative maintenance program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Ranch Winery has implemented a comprehensive set of safety programs to minimize the likelihood of injuries, accidents, and releases to the environment. The accidental release prevention program part of the safety programs is supported by a set of technical studies where systematic methods were employed to identify potential release scenarios. A detailed analysis of system design and operation was conducted using industry accepted hazard analysis methodologies. The studies included an analysis of potential operator actions and related human errors. The analyses ensured that there are adequate levels of safeguards for all the scenarios (including human error) identified. The possibility and effects of external events (i.e., earthquake, flood, strong wind, etc.) were also addressed. These studies confirmed that the refrigeration systems and related structures have been constructed with sufficient safety margin to withstand postulated external events scenarios. Recommendations were made and implemented that enhanced seismic ruggedness o"

The training program relevant to the Ammonia Refrigeration System follows the requirements of applicable regulations.\n\n\n\nThe Ranch Winery management organization includes a Senior Operations Manager whose responsibility is to ensure that proper safety and environmental policies, programs, and procedures are in place. A part of these policies, programs and procedures are designed to ensure compliance with Risk Management Plan regulation. They include a comprehensive management of change procedure that includes a pre-startup safety review policy as an integral part of the procedure, a contractor safety program and a hot work permitting process. All equipment related documentation and engineering information and drawings are maintained according to set standards that meets and exceeds the safety information requirements of the regulations. An incident investigation procedure is in place that documents the root cause analysis on any unwanted releases of anhydrous ammonia and related near misses. This procedure is in addition to injury and illness investigation procedure that has been implemented as part of safe work practice policies and procedures. Finally, a compliance audit policy is in place requiring the facility to conduct an audit once every three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable releases of ammonia at the facility in the past 5 years that had led to an injury, fatality, or environmental impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Ranch Winery has prepared and implemented an emergency action plan.
