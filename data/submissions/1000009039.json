      "SummaryText": "MMD Enterprises' facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the manufacture of crop fertilizer.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only hazardous material used in the manufactureing process. It is supplied by railroad tank car to the plant site's rail and offloaded by the plant's unloading arm.  Ammonia flows under delivery pressure to a 12000 gallon storage bullet (pressurized storage tank) .  The storage tank outlet on-off valve is manually opened when ammonia is needed in the process.  Ammonia passes thru the expansion valve where it is depressurized into a gas and concommitantly cooled.  Well water is vaporized into steam and heats the ammonia by counter-current flow in a shell and tube heat exchanger.  The heated ammonia gas is added to the production line by manual block valves and a throttle valve.\n\nThe following safety precautions have been provided for: safety relief valve on the storage tank, excess flow valves to prevent flow from storage tank if any hose or piping breakes, barrades to prevent automobiles from inadvertently entering the ammonia storage and transfer area, TEMA pressure controls on the ammonia heat exchanger, isolation valves and a water deluge system to contain and ammeliorate an ammonia spill.\n\nThe worst case scenario is an ammonia storage release of all 12000 gallons forming an ammonia vapor cloud over the plant and the surrounding area within a 2.7 mile radius.  A more plausible scenario is a hose break in the ammonia loop which would release 380 pounds of ammonia into the surrounding area within a 0.15 mile radius.\n\nRecently new dual flow meters and pressure switches, as well as ammoniaq alarms in the steam vent, hve been added to the production area.  If the meters or pressures don't mqtch, spring loaded valves immeidately close, shutting down the process.\n\nMMD Enterprises' employees are trained and given written exams on how to manufacture their products in the presence of an ammonia loop and ammonia addition into production inclusive of safety proce"
