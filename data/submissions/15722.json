The Prevention Program will be reviewed annually and updated as needed.  The Prevention Program will also keep a record of incidents involving releases and any remediations.\n\nEmergency Response Information\nA controlled release of the chlorine or sulfur dioxide product located at the wastewater treatment plant site shall be defined as the escape of gas to the atmosphere in small, non-reportable quantities, resulting from standard operating procedures to connect or disconnect chlorine containers and standard maintenance procedures on the plant's chlorine or sulfur dioxide delivery systems. \n\nAn uncontrolled release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide which will require the implementation of emergency response procedures is defined as any release other than those examples defined as similar to controlled releases.  Emergency responses to the treatment plant will be made by the Amarillo Fire Department, in accordance with the community response plan.  If uncontrolled release conditions warrant such actions, shelter-in-place, evacuation and public warning will be implemented by the Amarillo/Potter/Randall Department of Emergency Management.  Any uncontrolled release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide shall be subject to an after action incident investigation by the City of Amarillo, exclusive of State and Federal agency regulatory review and oversight."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRIVER ROAD WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\nGeneral Facility Information\nThe River Road Wastewater Treatment Plant, located approximately ten miles northeast of downtown Amarillo in Potter County, is a City of Amarillo facility which treats up to 16 million gallons per day (mgd) of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater.  On average, the wastewater treatment plant facility processes 12 million gallons per day.  The plant utilizes an activated sludge sewage treatment process and operates 24 hours per day, year round.  There are 14 employees on duty at the plant during normal business hours.  At night and during irregular work hours, two employees are always on duty at the facility.  A maximum of 18 tons of chlorine gas (Cl2) in one ton containers is stored onsite with six containers being connected and online at any one time.  The plant also has a maximum of 24 tons of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in one ton containers stored onsite with one container being connected and online at any one time.\n\nOngoing safety training programs cover all phases of plant operation from maintenance and operations safety to safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The River Road facility also conducts formal training as well as onsite training during normal daily operations.  Due to this safety training, this plant has had only one minor incident with no significant consequences in the last five years.\n\nHazard Assessment Information\n40 CFR Part 68, Subpart B - Hazard Assessment, outlines a specific set of criteria required to be used in the modeling of worst case and most probable case release scenarios.  Worst case and most probable case scenario modeling was completed using Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) software. \n\nTo complete most probable case and worst case scenario plume models, the default level of concern for chlorine and sulfur dioxide was set at levels established in EPA and American Industrial Hygiene Association guidance.  The resulting plume"
