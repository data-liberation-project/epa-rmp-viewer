This commitment is embraced by each member of the Johnson Controls team, no matter what position or area.  Our active role includes an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere.  Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance.  Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment.  Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: The Johnson Controls, Goshen facility occupies approximately 12.8 acres, with approximately 310,000 square feet under roof. The facility has manufacturing capabilities in machining, sheet metal stamping, plastic injection molding, and furnace brazing.  The process that is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard and EPA RMP Rule consists of anhydrous ammonia receipt, storage, dissociation, drying, and subsequent use of the dissociated ammonia (into hydrogen and nitrogen) in the brazing furnaces.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: The facility had developed and implemented a comprehensive process safety management program, incorporating all 14 elements of the standard. The facility has developed site and process specific training videos addressing chemical safety, operating procedures, emergency response procedures, and the over-all safety program. Equipment is addressed through a mechanical integrity program, incorporating plant personnel, and qualified contract and agency inspection services. Among the many safety features present at the facility are:\n\nOSHA Process Safety Management Program and EPA Prevention Program. \nAmmonia detection and alarm system.\nEyewash and safety showers.\nPersonal protective equipment, including emergency respirators.\nEmergency co"

A roof has been installed over the ammonia storage tanks to shield them from the elements, and an ammonia monitoring and alarm system has been installed in the storage and process areas. The facility encourages input from operation and maintenance personnel, as well as vendor and agency inspectors, and responds to address potential improvements."
