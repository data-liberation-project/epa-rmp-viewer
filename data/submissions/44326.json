      "SummaryText": "Shawnee Milling Company operates rural feed stores offering anhydrous ammonia to local farmers.  Onsite\nstorage and dispensing of this toxic chemical varies in quantities based on seasonal application demand.  For\napproximately 3-4 months of the year, maximum quantities of anhydrous ammonia are reduced to less than 20%\n(12,096 pounds) of the maximum 51,408 pounds held in storage.\n\nThe company ensures that tanks and components are regularly maintained by qualified contractors.  The facility\nis regularly inspected by both employees, it's insurance carrier, and the state of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis facility would have a maximum of 51,408 pounds of anhydrous ammonia onsite at its peak sales periods.\nAdministrative operating procedures limit the storage tank to 85% of its capacity.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is structural damage to the bulk storage tank containing, at peak operating periods, up \nto 51,408 pounds of NH3.  Failure would result in a near-full release of ammonia within 10 minutes in a rural\nenvironment.  The toxic endpoint has been calculated to 4.0 miles from the tank at which point it would be \ndispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Public receptors include residences.  Environmental\nreceptors include a national grasslands area open during seasonal hunting periods.  There are no other commercial\nor environmental receptors within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe more probable alternative accidental release would involve a transfer hose failure that could potentially \nrelease up to 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia before an emergency shutoff valve could be activated.\nThe toxic endpoint would be limited to 0.2 miles which would expose less than 5 people and no other \ncommercial or public receptors.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last five years.  Employees are trained in the safe\nhandling, storage and dispensing of anhydrous ammonia by the State of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.\n\nEmploye"
