EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/RMP SUBMITTAL\r\n14.1    CORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACHES\r\nAt this facility, Illinois American Water Company handles chlorine for the purpose of disinfecting and treating wastewater. OSHA and EPA consider chlorine as a hazardous chemical. The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is Illinois American Water Company's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends on the manner covered process chemicals are handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\n14.2    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n&#9679;\tThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Alton WWTP is 6,000 pounds.\r\n&#9679;\tThe chlorine is delivered by truck in one-ton cylinders. Liquid chlorine is added to wastewater by evaporating chlorine liquid to gas, metering the gas through an injector, and then diffusing the gas into the flow stream of water at the point of application.\r\n&#9679;\tSenior management is committed to the safe operation of our facilities and its impact on the surrounding communities.\r\n14.3    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\r\nChlorine - Greenish yellow gas with a pungent irritating odor.  Chlorine is liquefied under pressure, but is used as a gas at ambient temperature.  Illinois American Water Company uses chlorine for wastewater disinfection.  Both scenarios were calculated using guidance from the EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention Appendix F-Supplemental Risk Management Prog"

Fire department inspections/tours are being conducted annually, detailing on-site chemicals, storage locations, chemical hazards, special instructions and requirements.\r\n14.7    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThere are no immediate plans for changes to improve safety at this facility. We constantly review advancement in safety and process technology for the continuing pursuit to provide a safer workplace and community."
