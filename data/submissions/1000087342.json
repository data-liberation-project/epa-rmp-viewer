EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/RMP SUBMITTAL\n\n14.1    CORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACHES\n\nAt this facility, Illinois American Water Company handles chlorine for the purpose of disinfecting and treating wastewater. OSHA and EPA consider chlorine as a hazardous chemical. The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the use and handling to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is Illinois American Water Company's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends on the manner covered process chemicals are handled and used, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design along with operating procedures and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\n14.2    THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n&#9679;    The maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Alton WWTP is 6,000 pounds.\n\n&#9679;    The chlorine is delivered by truck in one-ton cylinders. Liquid chlorine is added to wastewater by evaporating chlorine liquid to gas, metering the gas through an injector, and then diffusing the gas into the flow stream of water at the point of application.\n\n&#9679;    Senior management is committed to the safe operation of our facilities and its impact on the surrounding communities.\n\n14.3    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nChlorine - Greenish yellow gas with a pungent irritating odor.  Chlorine is liquefied under pressure, but is used as a gas at ambient temperature.  Illinois American Water Company uses chlorine for wastewater disinfection.  Both scenarios were calculated using guidance from the EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention Appendix F-Supplemental Risk Management Prog"

Worst-Case Scenario:\n\no    Failure of the largest vessel when full would allow a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine for a 10 minute duration.\n\no    Distance to the endpoint at 77? F would travel 1.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.\n\n?    Alternative-Case Scenario:\n\no    A tubing failure due to a bad connection or valve failure resulting in the release through a 1/16 inch diameter opening allowing a release rate of 10 pounds per minute for a 60 minute duration for a total release of 600 pounds of chlorine.\n\no    Distance to the endpoint at 77? F would travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.\n\n&#8195;\n\n \n\n                                                            Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\n \n\n                                                            Alternate Case Scenario\n\n14.4    THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility and process uses design codes and standards from the Chlorine Institute, Wallace and Tiernan, American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, and applicable state codes and regulations.\n\n14.5    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n14.6    THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe written emergency response program is located at the facility with an ongoing training program. Fire department inspections/tours are being conducted annually, detailing on-site chemicals, storage locations, chemical hazards, special instructions and requirements.\n\n14.7    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are no immediate plans for changes to improve safety at this facility. We constantly review advancement in safety and process technology for the continuing pursuit to provide a safer workplace and community.\n\n"
