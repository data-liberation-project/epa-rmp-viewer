Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Jacobson Warehouse Company, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental\r\nsafety. This commitment is demonstrated by our activities to prevent accidental releases from the storage\r\nand distribution processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent\r\npossible releases of regulated substances. If such a release were to occur, emergency response personnel\r\nare at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Our site specific Emergency Action Plan\r\nincludes steps and sequence of steps to be taken including appropriate contacts to make. We are contracted\r\nwith a third party chemical incident mitigation company to assist us should any release escape into the\r\nenvironment as necessary. We are also coordinated with the local fire department and local customer plant\r\nsafety personnel which provide additional emergency response expertise.\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities are comprised of the receipt, storage and shipment of hazardous materials in\r\nDOT approved packaged form for our customer. Currently we have product that contains vinyl acetate as part of a mixture. The product is stored\r\nin portable containers as finished product.\r\n3. The General Accident Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has developed and implemented a prevention program to prevent any accidental releases. This\r\nprogram incorporates the following elements: Safety examination, hazard review, operating procedures,\r\ntraining, maintenance and compliance audits.\r\n4. The 5 Year Accident History\r\nThis site has no reportable accidents during the past 5 years.\r\n5. Emergency Response Plan\r\nThis facility has a written Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. All\r\nemployees are trained on this plan and that training is documented. The Emergency Action Plan is available"

      "SummaryText": "to all employees at all times in the workplace.\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n*******Internal safety audits are completed annually. Any items needing corrective actions are documented and the\r\ncorrective actions are put in place by the Operations Manager. Confirmation of the corrective actions being\r\nput in place is done by the Director of Operations. The most recent audit at this facility identified the following: the flammable cabinet was not latching, the janitor closet did not contain a list of chemicals, staff safety meetings were being conducted but not documented, trailer inspections were not being conducted consistently and inbound seals were not being verified regularly.  All of these items have been corrected."
