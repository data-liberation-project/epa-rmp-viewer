The facility receives flammable gases, liquefied under pressure, by tank truck and places them in storage tanks.

Each of the storage tanks are pressure vessels and are permitted by the same regulatory agency.\n\nAll tanks, pumps, piping, fittings, valves and associated safety devices are installed and maintained following NFPA-58 Code requirements and National LP Gas Association guide lines. We have excess flow and check valves in lines, as well as manual and automatic shut off valves.  The tanks are equipped with an excess flow valve and pressure relief valve.  We have maintenance procedures that prevent corrosion.  Storage tanks are typically filled to 85% of full capacity as a matter of internal policy to maintain a margin of safety.\n\nShield has written operating procedures for safe unloading and handling of chemicals and gases.  \n\nShield has a robust preventive maintenance program that insures that the tanks and handling equipment remain in safe working condition. The employees are well trained to perform their particular job tasks in a safe and competent manner.\n\nShield is a non-responding facility.  The local Fire Department has been informed that they would be summoned immediately as first responders.  All installations have been inspected and approved by local Fire Department.  The Fire Department conducts periodic walk through of the entire facility.  This enables them to prepare for adequate emergency response.
