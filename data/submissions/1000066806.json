      "SummaryText": "Frosty Packing Co., LLC operates an apple packing warehouse and refrigeration storage in northwest Yakima, Washington.  This RMP is for a storage only facility located at 2809 River Road.  Apples are harvested and loaded in regular cold storage rooms and controlled atmosphere rooms over a several week period in the fall. Apples are removed from the storage rooms and washed, sorted, and packaged for fresh fruit markets, year round. The packaged apples are stored in refrigerated rooms until shipment. A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system every day and continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. It is present as both a liquid under pressure and as a vapor in the system. There is approximately 13,783 pounds of ammonia in the refrigeration system. The ammonia inventory was increased to provide cooling to equipment added by MOC#2013a.  To maintain a safe facility operation Frosty Packing Co., LLC has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of actions to take if an ammonia release is detected. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system which sends a message to the refrigeration operator by a dial-up modem. Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator of any alarms or out-of-normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures). All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan with annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan. The facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant, and has in place both OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Manageme"

      "SummaryText": "nt Program (RMP) (40 CFR, Part 68). These programs are readily available to on-site personal to assist in maintaining a safe operating facility. As required by the RMP an \"Off-site Consequence Analysis\" has been done for the facility to determine what impact the \"Worse Case\", and the more realistic \"Alternate Case\" releases of ammonia would have, if any, on the surrounding area. There have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years. To deal with any possible release of ammonia, Frosty Packing Co., LLC maintains an ongoing relationship with two experienced refrigeration contractors, both within 6 miles in Yakima. In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about five minutes away. The facility has an action plan, not a response plan, so it is not expected or intended that employees would attempt to enter the facility until properly trained personnel with the appropriate HAZMAT equipment arrive. The local Fire Department has HAZMAT trained and equipped personnel.  The on-going Mechanical Integrity program and use of Standard Operating Procedures, along with annual training for all personnel, assures a safe working environment and safety to the public and ecology."
