Lathrop (Carpenter) manufactures flexible slab stock polyurethane foam (Prime Pour Process) and is one of the process that utilizes Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) (TDI) a RMP regulated substance as the prime ingredient. The second flexible slab stock polyurethane foam manufacturing procedd called (Rebond Process) uses an commercial 80:20 TDI blend (80 wt% 2,4 TDI and 20 wt% 2,6 TDI) with scrap / recycled polyurethane foam to produce carpet underlay padding. No other RMP-regulated substances are used at this facility.\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nIt is the policy of Carpenter Co. to comply fully with all federal, state and local rules and regulations regarding the proper handling, use, storage, and emergency response preparedness to prevent accidental release of chemicals toxic or otherwise.  Furthermore, Carpenter is committed to protecting the health and welfare of both its employees and the surrounding community. To achieve this goal procedures, policies, preventive maintenance and training is provided. Safety depends on the manner in which TDI is handled combined with (1) the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, (2) the safe handling procedures and check lists that are used and (3) the training imparted to our personnel. In addition regular audits and inspections are conducted to ensure our personnel are aware of the safety requirements and are implementing the procedures.\n\nCarpenter\u00bfs Emergency Response Program is based on and set to comply with OSHA Hazardous Waste and Emergency Operations (HAZWOPER) regulation (29 CFR 1910.120) including the City of Lathrop Fire Department Business Emergency Plan, state and local regulations. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification to the Lathrop Fire Department (local AA).\n\n2.

The North of the property is zoned for industries, South of the property has light industrial and commercial buildings, to the East it is bound by Interstate-5 and West of the property is open area.\n\nCarpenter manufactures polyurethane foam for use in furniture, bedding, carpet cushion underlay and other applications. The manufacturing process incorporates the use of TDI as a reactant to produce foam. TDI is received by railcar and occasionally by tanker trucks and is stored in two indoor storage tanks inside the building. TDI is pumped from the storage tanks to the pouring line through a strainer, heat exchanger and filter prior to entry into the mix head where it is mixed and reacts with other Catalyst and Amines to produce polyurethane foam as slabs. The foam is placed in a large section of the building (Slab room) for curing. After curing, it is sent to cutting stations where it is cut to the size and shape specified by our customers. The facility is monitored 24 hours by security personnel and access to the plant area is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors accompanied by plant personnel. TDI is the only substance handled at this facility that is regulated under EPA Risk Management Program (RMP). The maximum inventory of TDI is 410,000 lbs (assumed to be one (1) railcar, with 190,000 lbs and two (2) storage tanks of 110,000 lbs each). This exceeds the TDI threshold of 10,000 lbs.\n\n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario: Assessment and modeling was conducted for a worst-case release of TDI from the Carpenter, Lathrop, CA plant. Worst-case was assumed to be an immediate release of a railcar quantity (190,000 lbs) of TDI into a graded emban"

      "SummaryText": "kment that directs the release into an underground drain that works as a containment area. During the winter months, the TDI railcar is pre-heated to a maximum temperature of 110 F before unloading the railcar. For the purpose of modeling the higher temperature of 110 F has been used. Due to the high boiling point and low vapor pressure of TDI, the resulting plume is very dilute with a density close to air \u00bf a neutrally buoyant plume. This is confirmed by the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document which indicates that TDI will have a neutrally buoyant plume. Using the equations found in the EPA guidance, the duration of release is estimated to be over 2 years. \n\nThe model selected is based on the type of release anticipated. In Carpenter\u00bfs case, we anticipate a very large pool of material at ambient temperature and pressure with a very low vapor pressure that will result in a slow steady release over an extended period of time. Although there may be a concentrated vapor area in the middle of the pool immediately above the surface of the liquid, the emissions will be very dilute. The Society of Plastic Industry (SPI) in conjunction with U.S. EPA RMP Guidance Analysis model specifically for TDI was used to identify the endpoint Distance. In particular, equation D-1 of the guidance document was used to estimate pool evaporation based upon vapor pressure correlation published by NIST. A Gaussian plume model was used to determine the endpoint distance based on the evaporation rate. Based on the modeling results no emissions of TDI over the toxic endpoint are expected. The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.007 gms/m3 is less than 165 feet which is well within the facility. The nearest facility boundary is approximately 300 feet. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario:  Not Required.\n\n4.

Five-year accident history.\n\nDuring the last five years one injury accident has occurred involving TDI and one non-injury accident.

Emergency Response Program.\n\nCarpenter Co. has coordinated the Emergency Response Program with Lathrop Fire Department (localAA) emergency HAZMAT team. A thorough HAZWOP review of the TDI process was completed with representatives from the fire department and the local community in November 1997 to comply with the State of California Risk Management Prevention Plan (RMPP) update.
