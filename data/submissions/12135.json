The Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the RMP regulations as required in the 1990 Amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act.  The goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The RMP regulations apply to facilities that handle, manufacture, use or store toxic and flammable substances listed in the regulations above specified threshold quantities.\n\nFoster Farms prepared a RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia and chlorine handling systems and practices at the facility. Foster Farms incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine injection systems at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia and chlorine handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team.  \n\nFTP 1 is located at 520 C Street in Turlock, California.  Foster Farms purchased the facility in 1982 from the Grange Company.  The facility, originally constructed in the 1950s, is located on approximately 2 acres bordered by 5th Street on the ea"

The areas surrounding the facilities consist of residential, industrial and commercial properties.  The Foster Farms facility is surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance to the facility is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nOperations at the facilities consist of the slaughter, processing, and storage of poultry products.  The facility receives live turkeys from various ranches.  The turkeys are slaughtered and then dropped into cold water chill tanks.  They are then either packaged at FTP 1 or sent to other Foster Farms' facilities for further processing.  All processing rooms and cold storage units are cooled by air handling units supplied with ammonia.  The ammonia and chlorine systems at FTP 1 are located in secured rooms, in a fenced area, or on the roofs of the facility.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system at the facility.  The system provides cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, ice makers, and water chillers.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  Ammonia is used as the heat transfer media in the refrigeration system.  As the ammonia passes through heat exchangers in the various refrigerated areas or units, heat is transferred to the ammonia thus cooling the air, water, or product that is giving up heat.  The ammonia is then compressed and passes through a condenser where the ammonia gives up heat to air and water.  The ammonia then cycles back through the heat exchangers to repeat the process.  Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used industrial refrigerant due to its relatively efficient heat transfer characteristics.\n\nGaseous chlorine is used at FTP 1 for disinfect"

Gaseous chlorine is injected into various water streams at the plant to maintain chlorine concentrations in water as required by the regulatory agencies governing poultry processing.  Chlorine containers are stored at the injection system location along the exterior of the southwest-facing wall of FTP 1, in an alleyway between two buildings.  Buildings along the alleyway provide shading for the chlorine containers.  The portable containers have a capacity of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.\n\nThe chlorine injection system consists of a container of liquid and gaseous chlorine under pressure connected to an injection system.  Vacuum regulators attached to the containers allow gaseous chlorine to pass into the injection system when the regulator senses vacuum.  Vacuum is created in the system when water flows past the injection point.  A metering system controls the volume of chlorine that is injected.  The maximum amount of chlorine in a one-ton container is 2,000 pounds.  \n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms had one reportable release within the past five years.  On March 15, 1996 an inspection cover gasket on the oil separator of a screw compressor failed and ammonia vapor released into the Plant 1 engine room..  The leak duration was approximately one-half hour.  The leak ended when the operators isolated the oil separator from the system.  Approximately six employees from a nearby facility were taken to a local hospital and received a medical examination as a result of exposure to ammonia released from the FTP ammonia system.  All individuals were released from the hospital upon examination.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP.  Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to FTP 1 due to the quantity of ammonia and chlorine used.  Program 3 facilities ar"

The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"the greatest amount held in a single vesselreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.  For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled.  Additional worst case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \n\nA release of chlorine from a one-ton container results in the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint for FTP 1.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the chlorine container would be required for this scenario to occur.  \nAssuming pessimistic atmospheric conditions, very conservative chemical dispersion characteristics, and a toxic endpoint of three parts per million (ppm) chlorine vapor, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario is 1.3 miles.  The EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, October 1998, was used for the chemical dispersion analysis.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered in the analysis. \n\nAs required by the RMP regulations, Foster Farms modeled an alternative release scenario for each toxic substance contained in a process covered by RMP regulations.

The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles.\n\nFoster Farms used the alternative release scenario for ammonia described in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998, for an ammonia release from FTP 1.  The release scenario is described as a <-inch effective diameter orifice leaking liquid ammonia and resulting in an airborne release, representative of a pipe connection leak or a gasket rupture.  The evaluation used a release rate of 89 pounds/minute and average weather conditions.  The predicted distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.08 miles, or approximately 399 feet.  The SLAB Model was used for modeling the alternative release scenario.  SLAB was first developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy.  SLAB has been revised and updated by the USAF Engineering and Services Center and the American Petroleum Institute.  SLAB is commonly used to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of denser-than-air releases.\n\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration and chlorine injection systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.\n\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.
