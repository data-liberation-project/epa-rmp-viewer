Manager\nPhone 712-722-2671\n\n1. \nThe owners, management, and employees of Farmers Coop Society are committed to teh prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with teh local fire department, or other authorities, to occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and teh environment.\n\n2. Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale directly to farmers.\n\n3. The Worst-case and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 113,815 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.12 miles\n\nThe alternate release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of despersion to 200 ppm) is .56 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe Farmers Coop Society has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.The Five-year accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmen"
