This Emergency Response Plan takes care of any accidents that may occur in the facility.  Thus RCWD is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.\n\nThe ER Plan also includes specific steps, which will be taken in response to accidental release of regulated substances.  Furthermore, our facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release programs and includes information on emergency health care."
