The Facility Policy for Co-Alliance\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Co-Alliance, LLP are committed to prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nB.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed?grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nC. The maximum amount of Anhydrous at the facility at any given time is 670654lbs.  Of that 159968lbs could be stored in a railcar, 223862lbs in bulk storage and 286824lbs. in nurse tanks.\n\n3. The Worst Case Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario. \n\nA. The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a tank rail car released as a liquid/gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 160000lbs., which represents the volume of the tank car\n\nb The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose over a 2 minute period of time.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1\", published by The American National Standards institute, inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". \n\n5. The five-year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that Have caused any deaths, i"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n\n\na.A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910 38;\nb.Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right?to?know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\nC.A written emergency response program. In accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre?emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
