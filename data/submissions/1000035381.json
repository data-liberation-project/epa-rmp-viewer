Although the use of chlorine has been known to produce various regulated disinfection by-products in the finished water, the use of chlorine is required by the Safe Drinking Water Act and by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GAEPD).  Disinfection by-products associated with chlorine are below the regulated levels as regulated by the Stage 1 and Stage 2 Disinfectants/Disinfection By-Products Rule and water quality criteria established by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. \n\n  \n\nThis RMP provides process safety information, process hazard analysis, employee training, standard operating procedures, safe work practices, information on the contractor safety program, and emergency response related to the Shoal Creek Filter Plant chlorine system.  \n\n\n\nChlorine is delivered to the Shoal Creek Filter Plant in one-ton chlorine containers by a chemical supplier.  These chlorine containers are connected to a pipeline system (designed exclusively for the transport of chlorine gas) and delivered to four chlorinators.  The chlorinators operate under vacuum conditions and deliver chlorine gas to a chlorine injector.  The injector mixes the chlorine gas into a water stream that makes a concentrated chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is then applied to the appropriate application point at the water treatment plant to insure adequate disinfection is provided as required by the Surface Water Treatment Rule.  A chlorine residual is maintained in the distribution system to protect the system from potential outside contamination and to control microbial populations within the system.  \n\n\n\nAccidental chlorine releases can be caused by a multitude of reasons.  In the event of a chlorine release (either small or large) e"

The plant also has a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) that clearly identifies how to unload chlorine containers, hook up chlorine containers, startup the chlorinators, and how to disconnect chlorine containers.  In addition to the above, employees are required to conduct walk through inspections of the chlorine facilities 4 times a day (every 6 hours) and document any potential problems that may occur.  \n\n \n\nIn the event of a chlorine release, an emergency response plan has been developed that identifies the operational and managerial procedures used to evaluate and determine if a plant evacuation is necessary.  The plan addresses the procedures for responding to minor and major chlorine releases and describes evacuation plans for the employees, contractors, and visitors; at the Shoal Creek Filter Plant.  \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years. \n\n"
