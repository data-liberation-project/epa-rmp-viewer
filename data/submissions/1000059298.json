The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs. Employees receive training on the procedures to be followed in an emergency scenario. The emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. Periodic drills or tabletops exercises are conducted to test the response plan. \r\n\r\nThe Granger Gas Plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency situations."

Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe Granger Gas Plant is located approximately 10 miles west of Little America, Wyoming.  The facility includes compression, dehydration, cryogenic liquid recovery, hydrocarbon fractionation and a refrigeration system.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and a liquid product containing ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier liquids.  Propane, iso-butane and butane are stored under pressure and shipped from the plant via truck.  The liquefied product containing ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons are not stored at the facility, but shipped via pipeline.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic.  There are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Granger Plant.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the last five years there have not been any hydrocarbon releases whose quantities approached those described in the RMP release events.\r\n\r\n \r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\n\r\nThe Granger Gas Plant is a non-responding facility. The facility maintains a written eme"
