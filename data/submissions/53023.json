In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.  Our safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnect and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nPioneer Foods utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the cooling medium for its production of frozen foods.  Refrigeration is necessary for conditioning the room air in production areas, cooling water, and glycol used as secondary coolants, freezing product, and maintaining product at desired temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia was selected because of its superior heat transfer capacities and non-ozone depleting qualities.\n\nAccident Prevention Program\n\nThe facility at Prosperity, South Carolina was constructed in 2002.  It was constructed by  reputable contractors who had to comply with the plant's safety program.  All construction on the ammoni"

Work performed was in compliance with ASHRAE Standard 15, \"Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\" and ASME B31.5 \"Refrigeration Piping.\"  The plant has hired experienced refrigeration personnel to handle the operation and maintenance of the system.  These individuals have completed necessary RMP training and are experienced with working on ammonia systems.\n\nThe facility is installed with numerous devices to aid technicians in the safe operation of the plant.  Ammonia detectors are located throughout the plant to indicate any leaks that may occur.  The system is equipped with a computer control system that can be accessed both from the facility and via a computer equipped with a modem.\n\nAccident History\n\nThe facility has never had an ammonia related accident.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nTechnicians responsible for the safe operation have received HAZMAT training.  The Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs require that the individuals responsible for the emergency operations receive annual training.  Newberry County is equipped with a HAZMAT team to assist the plant.  The plant will continue to update and review the emergency response program with all additional employees.\n\nChanges to improve safety \n\nPioneer Foods is very grateful of their employees and stresses their safety.
