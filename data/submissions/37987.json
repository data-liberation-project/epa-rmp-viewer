Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nWah Chang?s basic commitment to responsible stewardship of the environment, protection of the community, protection of employee health, and assurance of product safety extends to the processes covered by the new EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  The Wah Chang (WC) facility at 1600 Old Salem Road in Albany, Oregon has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations which may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nThe facility plans to meet or exceed regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at the facility have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemicals include chlorine, aqueous ammonia, phosgene, and titanium tetrachloride. \nPrograms have been developed to comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and EPA's 40 CFR part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions in the Risk Management Program.  \n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to extract zirconium and hafnium from zircon sand and produce various metal products.  These products are sold to customers who produce final products for the nuclear industry, the industrial process industry and other related industries.  Zirconium chemical products as well as byproducts are also sold. \nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are chlorine, "

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nWah Chang has developed worst-case and alternative case release scenarios for each regulated substance.  The development of the worst-case scenario is dictated by the EPA.  The amount of the substance released for the worst-case scenario is equal to the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe line.  For toxic chemicals that are normally gases at ambient temperature and are handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the chemical is assumed to be released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The release rate to the atmosphere is calculated as the quantity released divided by 10 minutes unless passive mitigation is in place.   For toxic gases that are handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released substance is not contained by passive mitigation systems or if the contained pool would have a depth of 1 cm or less, it is assumed that the substance is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  If the released substance is contained by passive mitigation systems in a pool with a depth greater than 1 cm, it was assumed that the quantity is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool and the release rate to the atmosphere was calculated at the boiling point of the substance. \nThe alternative case release scenarios for the regulated toxic substances were developed by WC based upon experience with the substances.  These scenarios are considered more likely to occur than the "

As part of its release prevention program, discussed in detail in the next section, WC is constantly monitoring, reviewing, and upgrading its standard operating procedures and equipment.  In addition, WC has developed a detailed Facility Emergency Response Plan (FERP) and individual Departmental Emergency Response Plans (DERPs) to minimize the effects of a release should one occur.  In addition to these administrative controls, WC has automatic release mitigation systems in place for the regulated substances, which are discussed below.  \nWith the exception of the worst-case scenario for phosgene, the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case and alternative case scenarios for each substance was calculated using EPA?s RMPComp computer modeling program.   The Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) model version 2.1 was used to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario for phosgene.   The RMPComp model is considered conservative and would generally give longer distances than computer model developed specifically for WC.\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements which will help the facility to minimize releases of regulated substances.  A description of each of the elements is given below:\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Facility has involved employees in the development and implementation of the elements of Process Safety Management and the Prevention Program.

Employees who work in or maintain the process utilize the procedures.  The procedures address all operational phases, and are reviewed at least annually to ensure they remain up to date.  Copies of the Standard Operating Procedures are available in the corresponding control rooms.  The Manager of Process Assurance is responsible for notifying the supervisor of the process area the date by which the SOP needs to be re-certified.  The supervisor of the process is responsible for ensuring the manual is reviewed and certified annually.  The ongoing recordkeeping requirements for the standard operating procedures are:\n\n?Proof of certification annually that the standard operating pro"

A facility wide Contractor Program is available in the Engineering Department.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review\n\nWC ensures a new or significantly modified facility in a regulated process is as safe as possible before starting the system.  To assist in assuring safety, a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is performed before regulated substances are introduced to the system.  The PSSR verifies the following information:\n?Training is complete\n?SOPs are complete\n?Construction/equipment is in accordance with the design specifications\n?A PHA has been complete, if it is a new facility\nRecords of the PSSRs and procedures are available in the Safety Office.  The supervisor of the area/ construction project leader is responsible for ensuring a PSSR is performed. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWC provides appropriate resources to ensure that the equipment used to process, store, or handle highly regulated substances is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of the regulated substances into the workplace or community.  To accomplish this goal, a Mechanical Integrity Program is in place to ensure the continued integrity of the processes.  The Mechanical Integrity Program is implemented for the systems that could potentially result in the release of a hazardous chemical.  The program utilizes increased maintenance training, and preventive maintenance in conjunction with regular inspections and tests, to ensure equipment is in satisfactory condition.  A summary of the Mechanical Integrity Program is found in the PSM Central Files with more details located in the maintenance shop.  The ongoing "

The Hot Work Permit System is specifically concerned with the permitting of hot work operations associated with welding and cutting on or near PSM/RMP regulated process areas.  The permits document compliance with the fire prevention and protection requirements.\nAdditional safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, and control over entrance are also implemented to increase facility safety.\n\nThe ongoing recordkeeping requirements for the hot work/safe work programs are:\n?Copies of the hot work permit showing: that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) are in place prior to beginning the hot work operations; the date(s) authorized for hot work; and the object on which hot work is to be performed.  The permit is kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWC manages all changes to processes regulated by PSM or RMP to ensure the processes are operated and maintained as safely as possible.  To assist in accomplishing this goal, a Management of Change Program is in place.
