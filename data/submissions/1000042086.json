      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards. Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  The LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes in providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and the CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions, which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The LADWP prepared and submitted RMPs for the Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station in June 1999, June 2004, and June 2009.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2009 RMP.  The LADWP prepared Program Level 2 RMPs in 1999 and 2004 because Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. However, in the excess of caution, the LADWP decided to prepare a Program Level 3 RMP in 2009. Thus, this 2014 update of the 2009 RMP also demonstrates compliance with the Program Level 3 requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Update Executive Summary: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\u00bf\tGeneral facility and regulated substances information."

All applicable requirements of the State of California and the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \r\n\r\nThe LADWP emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA and the CalARP Program Emergency Response Program Requirements.  The LADWP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.

The station consists of a building with storage area for chlorine ton containers, a chlorinator room with two chlorinators and injectors, and an instrument room, which houses the station's mini-scrubber.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  There is a maximum of two chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station.  A maximum of two one-ton containers can be attached to the chlorine header for discharging chlorine gas at one time.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) online. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and the CalARP regulations. It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards. However, the facility is normally unoccupied and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms that may occur.  Thus, the LADWP Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station is not subject to the federal or the California OSHA PSM regulations.\r\n\r\nThere is a maximum of two chlorine one-ton containers at the chlorination station. Both ton containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight remaining in the container.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the ton container through a vacuum regulating valve, which is installed directly on the container angle valve.  Chlorine gas is pulled under vacuum from the vacuum regulating valve through plastic tubing and the chlorine PVC header lines to one of the two chlorinators provided at the chlorination station. In case of rupture of the plastic tubing connecting the container to the header lines, air would be drawn in rather than chlorine being released, and the vacuum regulator valve will shut down the ch"

From the chlorinator, the gas is pulled by vacuum to an injector on the wall where chlorine gas is dissolved into mixing water to form a concentrated solution.  This solution is then piped into the pumping station forebay for further mixing to provide disinfection.  The forebay chlorinated water is then piped into the water distribution network.\r\nResidual free chlorine is continuously monitored by a residual analyzer.  Rate of gas flow through the chlorinator is adjusted by a controller in response to flow and residual signals.\r\n\r\nChlorine leak detectors are provided inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP's Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) Control Room at Sylmar.\r\n\r\nA dry media chlorine \"mini-scrubber\" unit (MS) has been installed at the Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station.

A list of recommended actions was developed in January 2014 to further improve the chlorine safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of the recommended actions.\r\nA seismic walkthrough was completed on February 21, 2014 based on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) Region 1 guidance document and recommendations are being evaluated for implementation.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe LADWP has prepared written operating procedures for Manhattan Wells Chlorination Station that provide clear instructions or steps for safely conducting activities relating to chlorination process. They are consistent with the chlorine safety information.   Written operating procedures included in the facility's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Manual are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tDelivery of Chlorine.\r\n\u00bf\tContainer Connections.\r\n\u00bf\tInitial Startup Procedure.\r\n\u00bf\tNormal Operation.\r\n\u00bf\tNormal Shutdown.\r\n\u00bf\tTemporary Operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Shutdown.\r\n\u00bf\tStartup Following Emergency Shutdown.\r\n\r\nTraining \r\nThe LADWP ensures that each employee operating or maintaining the chlorination process, and each employee newly assigned to this process, is trained and tested for competency in the operating procedures listed above.  The LADWP employee training documentation files include training records for each"

This constitutes a final check that the process and equipment are ready to go and that the recommendations of the PHA have been implemented or adequately addressed.  This will ensure that the design and construction of a new or modified process is safely executed and that the facility is prepared to operate it. \r\n\r\nMechanical integrity procedures for the plant ensure that written maintenance procedures are implemented and documented, including training of maintenance personnel.\r\n\r\nMaintenance \r\nThe LADWP operates a maintenance program, MAXIMO Program that generates a work order for performing the preventive maintenance routine, which occurs after a designated time past the closing of the previous work order for that particular maintenance activity.  Description of the work to be performed is included with the printed work order.  The water treatment supervisors are responsible for the maintenance of the chlorination system.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the written maintenance procedure is provided in the O&M Manual as follows: Preventive maintenance schedules are provided which summarize inspection, test, and maintenance schedules on a daily, weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, biannual, and annual, every 2 to 10 years, and on as-needed basis.  These procedures allow the operator to rapidly review what maintenance is necessary.  The schedules are supplemental to the log sheets onsite and provide a summary and quick reference to manufacturer's O&M manuals.  A maintenance log book is provided onsite for Operator quick reference.\r\n\r\nThe LADWP documents inspection, testing, and maintenance of ch"

The hot work procedures require the issuance of a hot work permit whenever it is conducted on or near the chlorination process and other areas deemed appropriate as described in these procedures.  Fire prevention and protection systems are in place before a hot work permit is issued. The permit indicates the dates the work is authorized for, the location, and specific operational requirements, and it is kept on file in the administrative office. \r\n\r\nThe LADWP Management of Change procedures include steps required to be taken by plant personnel before implementing changes to chlorination equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions.  Training, process safety information, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are updated according to the changes made.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\nThe LADWP has been certifying every three years (or earlier) that compliance with Program 2 Prevention Program requirements is met and that procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. Starting June 2009, the LADWP certified compliance with Program 3 Prevention Program requirements. The two most recent audit reports and a list of the recommendations are retained in the LADWP's files.\r\n\r\nThe compliance audit consists of separating the RMP program elements or sections, and auditing each element to determine compliance and effectiveness.  For each internal audit, the audit team completes a Compliance Audit Certification Page and a Compliance Audit Checklist.  The Compliance Audit Certification Page provides process identification, the dates of the audit, team members, and certification by the audit leader."
