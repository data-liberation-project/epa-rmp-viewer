The Hattiesburg Water& Sewer Department Accidental release prevention policy involves operational\nprocedures, management practices and continued training to prevent accidental releases. Continued\nimprovement of facilities and procedures will reduce accidental releases. The emergency response policy\ninvolves procedures to notify and coordinate response with local responders.\n\nB. Hattiesburg South Lagoon is one of two wastewater treatment facilities serving the City of Hattiesburg,\nMississippi. Chlorine gas is used to disinfect the wastewater at this location after it has been treated. Sulfer Dioxide is used to remove the chlorine residual. This facility is located in the southeastern section of the city at 1903 E. Hardy St. The maximum amount of chlorine at this facility would be 6 one ton containers.  The maximum amount of Sulfer Dioxide would be 3 one ton containers. This facility is routinly checked 5 days a week.\n\nC. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified\nas \"worst case release scenario\" and \"alternative scenario\".  Both scenarios were calculated using EPAs RMP* Comp software.\n\nThe Worst case scenario involves a failure of a one ton chlorine cylinder with a 10 minute release duration and a releae rate of 110 pounds per minute. This scenario involves a release in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air. The offsite consequene of this scenario are as follows:\n1.Topgraphy: Urban Surroundings (many obstacles in the immediate area)\n2. Toxic Endpoint: 0.0087 mg/L; basis:ERPG-2\n3. EStimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.9 miles (1.4 Kilometers)\n4. Residential Population Estimate: 2000\nThe Meteorological assumptions about this scenario are:\nWind Speed: 1.5 meters/second (3.4miles/hour)\nStability Class: F\nAir Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves a tubing failure, bad connection, or va"

Topography: Urban Surroundings(many obstacles in the immediate area)\n2. Toxic Endpoint: 0.0087 mg/L; basis:ERPG-2\n3. Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.1 miles (0.2 Kilometers)\n4. Residential Population Estimate: 50\nThe meteorological assumptions about this scenario are\nWind Speed: 3 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour)\nStability Class: D\nAir Temperature: 77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\n\nD. The accidental release prevention program is based on the following elements:\n1. Training of operators\n2. Preventive maintenance program\n3. Use of process and safety equipment\n4. Use of effective operating procedures\n5. Reviews of operational procedures, training, hazards and safety information\nChemical specific prevention steps include the availibility of self contained breathing apparatus and awareness of the hazards and toxic properties of chlorine\n\nE. No accidental releases of chlorine have occcured at this facility in the past six years.\n\nF. Our facility is included in a community emergency response plan. Our employees will not responed to an accidental release other than notify the Hattiesburg Fire Department. Emergency response will be handled by the Hattiesburg Fire Department's Hazard incident Response Team."
