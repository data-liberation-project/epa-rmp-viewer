This WTP 1 Risk \nRisk Management Plan (RMP) submission to EPA is an update to the RMP submitted by USAG in 2006 under the facility name of U.S. Army Garrison - Redstone Arsenal.  As requested by EPA, a separate RMP has been prepared and submitted for USAG's WTP 3 due to the distance separating it from WTP 1.  This RMP complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, under Section 112 (r) of the CAA Amendments of 1990, 40 CFR Part 68, also called the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule).  \nThe chlorination system at the WTP 1 uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers.  Chlorine is the only chemical subject to the RMP Rule that is used at WTP 1; therefore, it is the only process examined. This document summarizes the existing health and safety programs, internal management response team, policies, procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize health and environmental impacts of accidental releases of chlorine. To date, USAG has had an accident-free record of chlorine storage and use at WTP 1, which is attributable to the safety of the process and the focus on training in safety, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and emergency response procedures. \nThe USAG has contracted the operation of WTP 1 to a private contractor (Chugach Management Services, Inc.).  The personnel employed by the private contractor operate and maintain the WTP 1.  The private contractor is required to comply with the contractor's responsibilities of the RMP Rule.\n\n2.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe USAG is committed to the safety of the process, personnel, and the public, and to th"

The USAG has implemented extensive safety precautions and has a Fire Department with trained and fully equipped Hazmat personnel.  The USAG has been proactive in improving the safety of WTP 1 using reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. These controls include leak detectors and alarms; awareness training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes; and programs to evaluate hazards at WTP 1.  The USAG requires the private contractor operating WTP 1 to use personnel trained in the operation of the chlorine storage and chlorination system. \nIn the event of an accidental release, the private contractor personnel and the USAG Fire Department personnel control and contain the release in a manner that is safe for personnel working in the area and helps prevent injury to the public or the environment.  The USAG provides response training to its personnel and to the private contractor personnel upon request, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the Fire Department.\n\n3.0  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Information\nThe WTP 1 is within the USAG's boundaries, which is located in Madison County.  Raw water from the Tennessee River is treated and purified to domestic water standards. The WTP 1 uses four rapid sand filters to treat the raw water.  Raw water from the Tennessee River is pumped into a 380,000-gallon clear well.  Fluoride and chlorine are added to the water.  The water is then filtered in the sand filters, chlorinated again, and pumped to a holding tank with a capacity of 250,000 gallons. WTP 1 has a capacity of 2.6 million gallons per day (mgd), with an average flow of 1.3 mgd during normal operation.\nThe WTP 1 currently stores a maximum of four 1-ton containe"

The chlorine storage at WTP 1 exceeds the threshold quantity (TQ) of 2,500 pounds listed in the RMP Rule.  WTP 1 has had no accidental releases of chlorine that led to an offsite impact in the last 5 years.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for WTP 1 is 22131 and it is not among the NAICS codes covered under the RMP Rule.  But the chlorine storage at WTP 1 is subject to the OSHA PSM standard; therefore, they are considered as Program Level 3 processes.  \n\n4.0  Offsite Consequence Analysis\nThe following information summarizes the updated offsite consequence analysis submitted to EPA using RMP*Submit 2004, as required by the RMP Rule.\n\n4.1  Chlorine Hazard Assessment\u00c2\u00bfWorst-case Scenario\nFor the worst-case release scenario (WRS) at WTP 1, USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of the entire contents of the largest single vessel or pipe over a 10-minute duration.  The released liquid was assumed to quickly volatilize and to disperse as a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the Risk Management Program toxic endpoint concentration of 3 ppm, was determined using EPA's RMP Comp&reg; model.  This circular distance to the toxic endpoint was used to evaluate the offsite impacts. \n\n4.2  Chlorine Hazard Assessment\u00c2\u00bfAlternative Release Scenario\nThe alterative release scenario (ARS) depicts a more likely release scenario that could occur compared to the WRS.  For the WTP 1, the USAG evaluated the offsite impacts associated with the release of chlorine gas from a 1/16-inch-diameter pinhole leak in the valve on the chlorine container, a likely scenario, for a release time of 60 minutes.  This scenario was selected during the process hazard analysis (PHA) conducted for WTP 1.  Only one ARS was evaluated for WTP 1.  The chlorine release rate was calculated using EPA's RMP Co"

The PHA technique used was a \"what-if\" scenario and a hazard review checklist, per acceptable approach guidance from EPA.  The PHA was led by a person knowledgeable about the type of process being reviewed and was conducted during December 2004.  This review will be updated within a 5-year period or whenever a major change occurs in the process.  There have not been any major changes in the process, therefore, no updates have been made to this PHA.  A list of actions to resolve any significant process hazard analysis findings at WTP 1 was prepared for resolution.  The USAG's WTP 1 staff will document the completion of action items as the PHA findings are resolved.  The PHA is maintained on file for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n7.4  Operating Procedures\nUSAG's WTP 1 maintains current operating procedures in the form of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) manuals and record the date of all procedures.  These procedures are maintained by the private contractor operating the WTP 1 to ensure that all affected employees are trained and understand the process operating procedures.  OEM manuals that include the operating procedures for various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal and temporary operation, and normal and emergency shutdown are at WTP 1 and are readily accessible to the private contractor personnel operating the system.  The Risk Management Program also includes the operating procedures for various modes of operation.  The OEM manuals also provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and maintenance and troubleshooting procedures. \nThe USAG's WTP 1 follows the Management of Change procedure to update the literature whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.

The USAG's auditors include personnel knowledgeable in the RMP Rule and the chlorine process, and evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP Rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process. Compliance audits are performed using forms suggested by EPA.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are maintained on file.\n\n7.10  Incident Investigation\nThe USAG and the private contractor operating WTP 1 jointly investigate all incidents that reasonably could have resulted in serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be prevented.  The USAG requires the private contractor operating WTP 1 to train its employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by affected staff, added or used to revise O&M procedures, and passed on to the training unit for inclusion in the existing training programs, if warranted, to prevent a future event. The Incident Investigation Report is maintained on file for 5 years.\n\n7.11  Employee Participation Plan\nThe USAG requires the private contractor operating the WTP 1 to follow the Employee Participation Plan to involve the private contractor employees in creating safety awareness and to enhance the safety of the chlorine process.
