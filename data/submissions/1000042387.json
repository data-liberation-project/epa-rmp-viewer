The etching process produces frosted lighting envelopes.  \r\n\r\nHydrofluoric Acid: HF acid at solution concentrations of 50-weight % or greater is regulated by the RMP rule.  Although normally dilutee to about 28 weight %, HF solutions are used in an etching process.  Occasionally, higher concentrations are used to etch glassware.  HF acid at a solution concentration of 70-weight % is stored in a large tank at the Ledvance facility for use in the process.\r\n\r\nA maximum of 3,248 gallons of 70-weight % HF acid is stored in one 5,623-gallon tank located at the Ledvance site.  The weight of HF acid in 3,248 gallons of 70-weight % solution exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity for HF acid in a process (1,000 lb.)  Because the HF acid storage process is not covered by requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration process safety management regulation and because the potential exists for offsite consequences resulting from an accidental release of HF acid, the process falls under the RMP Program 2 prevention program.\r\n\r\nIn calendar year 2003, a large bulk tank with a capacity of 12,000 gallons of 30% weight aqueous Ammonia was decommissioned, removed, and replaced with a smaller, 5,163 gallon, tank. \r\n\r\nAqueous Ammonia (Greater than 20%-by-weight):  Aqueous ammonia (also called aqua ammonia or ammonium hydroxide) is stored in our facility at a concentration of approximately 24% by weight in a 5,163 gallon horizontal, above-found storage tank.  We store a maximum of  33,348 pounds, which exceeds the threshold level of 20,000 pounds.  The ammonia is combined with hydrofluoric acid to form the chemical used to etch the inside surface of glass to provide it with a frosted appearance.   \r\n\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS: Ledvance has completed the OCA worst-case and alternative release scenarios for 70% HF and for 24% aqueous ammonia.
