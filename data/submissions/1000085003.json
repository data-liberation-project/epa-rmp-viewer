Those without a direct involvement in the operations and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system have received overview level training-what are the hazards, how can they be identified, and what to do in the event of a release.  \r\n\r\nFPL considers the delivery of ammonia at the site to be one of the highest risk activities.  Unloading will be done by the ammonia vendor by their qualified personnel.  As an additional safety measure, FPL will be in radio and/or visual contact with the unloading vendor during the unloading operations.  \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nA PHA process was undertaken as a part of the RMP.  Identified issues were considered and addressed.  The RMP was updated with additional What Ifs after the original PHA. \r\n\r\nThe site held an onsite training course titled: Designing and Implementing a PSM program to further enhance the skill set of the Martin team and our colleagues from our sister sites."

      "SummaryText": "SYSTEM DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nThe Martin Expansion Project (Unit 8) provides five additional electrical generating units on the property of the FPL Martin Power Plant.  These five units include four combustion turbine-generators, and one steam turbine-generator.  NOx emissions of the combustion turbines are reduced through the use of selective catalytic reduction.  That process consumes ammonia.  At this site, the ammonia is provided in anhydrous form.\r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia is stored in one 20,000 gallon steel storage tank, surrounded by a concrete retaining wall.  Ammonia is delivered by tanker truck in liquid form.  The maximum level to which it is filled is 86%.  In the tank, the ammonia is stored as liquid under pressure.  Two 100% capacity vaporizers are provided to ensure pressure is maintained at lower temperatures.  Pressure will vary from 80 to 300 psig.\r\n\r\nAmmonia vapor is transported via pressure to each heat recovery steam generator ammonia injection skid, where the ammonia is diluted with air prior to injection into the flue gas upstream of the catalyst.\r\n\r\nOPERATOR ORGANIZATION. \r\n\r\nFPL owns and operates the Martin Power Plant, including Unit 8 as of June 2005, Martin-Manatee Power Partners (MMPP) previously operated Unit 8.  MMPP is a limited liability corporation formed by parent companies Zachry Construction Corporation and Black & Veatch Corporation for the purpose of engineering, procuring, and constructing the expansion of the Manatee power plant.  As a part of its contractual obligations to owner FPL, MMPP operated the facility for three months. Under that obligation, MMPP created an RMP Manual and submitted *RMP Submit to EPA in March 2005.   This document replaces that previously created by MMPP.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nFPL has a long-established very high expectation regarding safety and environmental protection.  The following documents have been developed by FPL and are in practice at the Martin Power Plant: \r\n-  Safe Work Practices Manual and"

No other business objective has higher priority.\r\n\r\nThis Safety Policy is to guide all employees in pursuing their responsibility, shared with the Company, to safeguard the health and well being of everyone involved with FPL Group.\r\n\r\nFPL Group recognizes that safety is beneficial to the employee, the family, the community, the customer and the company.  FPL Group is therefore committed to providing a safe and health work environment for all employees and requires that safety should not be compromised for any other business priority.  We expect companies providing services to FPL Group to have the same high standards of safety and health as we do.\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the Company to provide the facilities, equipment, tools, procedures, safety programs, and training for employees to work injury free.  It is the responsibility of each employee to work safely for the benefit of the individual as well as co-workers.  This responsibility includes following appropriate safety rules and planning each work activity using appropriate risk assessment, good judgment and skills, along with a sincere dedication to work safely.\r\n\r\nEmployees should not start work until they understand what work is to be done and how to do it safely.  They are all expected to be engaged in the Company's Safety Management process.  Engagement includes communicating with all the parties involved about safety-related behaviors and conditions, and bringing to management's attention those issues which require their involvement and support.\r\n\r\nAll employees in leadership positions are responsible for deploying and actively supporting the Company's overall Safety Program.

FPL Group encourages all employees to carry this strong health and safety value beyond the workplace to all of their activities.     \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is covered at this site under the OSHA PSM rule.  Specific to this RMP, the prevention program consists of (1) Engineering Controls, (2) Establishment of safe Standard Operating Procedures and Training, (3) Process Hazard Assessment (PHA), and (4) Establishment of Management of Change Process.  These are described in more detail in the Prevention Program Description.\r\n\r\nThe overall approach to minimizing risk of accidental release is based on a foundation of sound engineering design, development of appropriate standard operating procedures, and training for affected employees.  Design has included features such as engineered controls to prevent overfilling of the tank, breakaway valve stations to minimize release should a truck pull away before uncoupling, monitoring stations for detection of accidental releases, and water sprays to help minimize migration of vapor releases.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the time of this filing.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nFPL employees are not trained as first responders.
