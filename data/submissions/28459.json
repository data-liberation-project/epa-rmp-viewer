The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association management and employees of the Cresbard, SD facility have implemented a variety of standard operating procedures, safe work practices, training programs and maintenance procedures designed to protect people, property and the environment.  The facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of an emergency accidental release, it is the policy of the management of the Cresbard, SD facility to notify the City of Cresbard Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency situation.  (b) The stationary source and regulated substances handled.    The South Dakota Wheat Growers Association Cresbard, SD facility stores and handles anhydrous ammonia for production of crops.  Anhydrous ammonia is a product regulated by Part 68 of the CAA and are in use at this facility at regulated quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, for retail sales, is stored in one above ground storage tank (AST) on a metal skid. Incoming product arrives by semi-bulk trucks. The facility also has 8 nurse trailers that allow farmers to supply nitrogen to the field.  (c) The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.     In our emergency planning we have considered two scenarios,  these involve a worst case release scenario and a more likely but still uncommon alternate scenario.  The worst case scenario involves the release of the entire contents of the largest tank of  anhydrous"
