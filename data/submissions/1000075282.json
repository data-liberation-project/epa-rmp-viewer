      "SummaryText": "The Simmons Foods facility was built in 1997 and formally known as Cannon Cold Storage.  The facility utilizes the most current state of the art ammonia refrigeration equipment and construction technics.  The system was designed, constructed and installed by one of the most respected names in commercial refrigeration, M&M Refrigeration of Federalsburg, MD. Construction of the system was subject to Federal, State and local regulations.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is microprocessor controlled.  This system in addition to controlling temperatures and pressures, includes monitored ammonia leak detectors throughout the facility which will both alarm locally and to a off site monitoring facility which notifies off site responders as necessary.  This system will automatically shut down and isolate the ammonia located in our high pressure receiver should a severe leak be detected, or operational parameters be found outside predetermed limits.\n\n\n\nA Risk Management Plan has been developed, including an Emergency Response Plan in the unlikely situation where an ammonia leak would reach outside our facility.  This plan has been reviewed with both the Bridgeville Fire Chief and the Sussex County Local Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.  There have been no accidents involving ammonia release which required reporting under the risk management rule since our inception.\n\n\n\nSimmons Foods has developed, implemented and maintains emergency response procedures as well as a Process Safety Management (PSM) program which is designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of releases of ammonia at this site and complies with OSHA PSM regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  We maintain up to date Process Safety Information and Mechanical Integrity activities."
