(Jayhawk), a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa-Huels Corporation, owns and operates a batch specialty chemical manufacturing facility near Galena, Kansas. The Jayhawk facility is located within the boundaries of a larger industrial complex, portions of which are owned by other corporations. The industrial area within which Jayhawk\u00bfs property and manufacturing operations are located is known locally as the \u00bfJayhawk Plant\u00bf, dating back to its creation in the 1940\u00bfs. That portion of the Jayhawk Plant Site containing Jayhawk\u00bfs property, buildings and equipment will be referred to hereinafter as the Facility. \nThe Facility is located on approximately 54 acres of a 2,200-acre industrial complex. Jayhawk\u00bfs Unit 1 encompasses approximately 29 acres and Unit 2 encompasses approximately 25 acres. The Facility is located approximately 3.5 miles northwest of the incorporated city of Galena, Kansas, lying 1.5 miles east of U.S. Highway 69 Alternate (69A), in Cherokee County, Kansas, and approximately 3.1 miles north of the junction of Kansas Route 66 and U.S. Highway 69A at Riverton, Kansas. \nThe Jayhawk Site can be characterized as flat with a typical base elevation on the order between 830-852 feet above mean sea level (MSL). Mean elevation of Jayhawk\u00bfs property is approximately 850 feet. The facility is located at latitude 37o06\u00bf59.4\u00bf North and longitude 094o:40\u00bf:27.6\u00bf West. The terrain in the local vicinity is flat to gently rolling land surface in a rural agricultural setting. The Spring River is located east and south of the facility. The land use immediately surrounding the facility is industrial with agricultural uses beyond the immediately adjoining land. Approximately 3.5 miles southeast of the facility is the town of Galena, KS., and approximately 22 miles to the north is the incorporated city of Pittsburg, KS.\nThe facility stores seven chemicals in excess of the threshold"

It is used as a scrubber media for the removal of nitrogen oxides from Unit 1 production processes. Aqua ammonia stored in the quantity indicated requires that the system comply with RMP Program Level III regulations.

The average wind speed is 8.44 Knots (9.71 miles per hour). The stronger winds come out of 150 to 180o with velocities of as much as 17 to 21 Knots, and on limited occasions (<1%) the wind velocities exceed 21 Knots. The prevailing wind appears to be out of approximately 165o. Winds are calm approximately 2.58% of the time. This data is based on 24 hours a day, 365 days per year for the year 1992. \nIn computing and modeling the worst case scenarios the atmospheric stability class was set to \u00bfF\u00bf and the wind speed was set at 1.5 meters per second in accordance with the US EPA guidance. For the alternative scenarios, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of \u00bfD\u00bf or \u00bfF\u00bf was used in accordance with the US EPA guidance. This was necessary due to the lack of the most recent three-year meteorological data.\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS\nWorst Case Scenarios\nWorst case scenarios were developed for each regulated chemical. The assumptions made included that the chemical was instantaneously released through catastrophic failure of the container, and if there were multiple containers of a single chemical within the same proximity, the release included the entire contents of all of the containers.\nFor all worst case scenarios, the following assumptions were made:\nWind Speed: \t1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour)\nStability Class:\t F\nAir T"

The tanks and cylinders have safety devices and systems to prevent or minimize the effect of any accidental release. An alternative scenario has been selected for each chemical that, although still very unlikely to occur, has a higher probability of occurrence than the worst case scenario, in accordance with U.S. EPA guidance.\nFor all alternative scenarios, the following assumptions were made:\nWind Speed:\t3 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour)\nStability Class:\tD\nAir Temperature:\t77 degrees F (25 degrees C)\nResidential population, public receptors and environmental receptors were assessed for each chemical within the radius of its associated endpoint. In most there was residential population, no environmental receptors, and the only public receptor that appears in the available data is the Boston Mills School located one-half mile east. This school was investigated and no longer exists. Therefore, there are no public receptors within the maximum endpoint radius of the alternative case scenarios.\nAcetaldehyde\nA more likely scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of the railcar unloading system.
