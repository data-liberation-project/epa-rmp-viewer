NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the CITY OF SULPHUR FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilities primary activities encompass TREATMENT OF WELL WATER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  Chlorine is used for treatment of well water for human consumption.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 4000.00 lb.\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe GRADNEY ST. NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to e"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the inspection and testing of all equipment related to chemical injection.  The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, the GRADNEY ST. NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nThe GRADNEY ST. NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe GRADNEY ST. NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the GRADNEY ST.

NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe GRADNEY ST. NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe GRADNEY ST. NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.
