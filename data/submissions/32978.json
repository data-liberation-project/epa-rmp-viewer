NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the CITY OF SULPHUR FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facilities primary activities encompass TREATMENT OF WELL WATER FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  Chlorine is used for treatment of well water for human consumption.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 4000.00 lb.\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with good engineering practices.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe GRADNEY ST. NORTH WATER TREATMENT FACILITY maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to e"
