Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and propane are stored at the facility in three storage tanks : two separate 18000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks in different locations, and one 18000 gal propane tank.. \n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 153000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia, and 67000 lbs. of propane. \n\n\n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .75 mile.  \n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .45 of a mile.  \n\n4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, publis"
