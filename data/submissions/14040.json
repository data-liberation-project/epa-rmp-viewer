Kilgore Mobil Pipeline facility, we handle flammable substances considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling flammable substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle flammable substances combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, with the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Transport, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  This commitment led our company to financially contribute to the Gregg and Harrison Counties First Call. Telephone Warning System. \n\nAdditionally, it is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Gregg County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Kilgore Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled \n\nThe Martin Transport, Inc. Kilgore Mobil pipeline is a storage and distribution facility for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  LPG is delivered to the facility via truck transpor"

LPG is regulated under 40 CFR 68 as a result of being a mixture containing regulated chemicals with flash points and boiling points less than 730F and 1000F, respectively.  Based on EPA guidelines, all scenarios can be based on the predominant flammable component of the mixture or the major component of the mixture (greater than 1% of the total) with the highest heat of combustion.  Therefore, the scenarios are based on butane. \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the Kilgore Mobil Pipeline facility is LPG.  The maximum quantity of LPG that can be stored at this facility is 140,000 pounds in one 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tank. \n The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe EPA defines the worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes the release occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nMartin Transport, Inc. Kilgore Mobil Pipeline facility worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 140,000 pounds of LPG, primarily butane.  To evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp\u0019 the EPA recommended software.  Based on 140,000 pounds of LPG (butane) released, the distance the affect of a vapor cloud explos"

Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternate release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is the failure of a flexible transfer hose while transferring LPG from a truck transport to the storage tank.  The flexible transfer hose has a nominal diameter of 2-inches.  Excess flow valves at the truck transport and check valves at the storage tank function to stop the flow of LPG if a transfer hose fails.  Additionally, a check valve at the loading rack would control any LPG in the hard piping between the loading rack and the storage tank, thereby eliminating any contributions to the release from the hard piping.  Therefore, the LPG released would be limited to 40 pounds, the amount in the transfer hose.\n\nThe scenario assumes the entire quantity of LPG in the transfer hose and iron piping is released.  RMP*Comp\u0019 estimates the distance endpoint for the release of 40 pounds of LPG, primarily butane as 0.01-mile.  The hazard endpoint extends offsite.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nOur Kilgore Mobil Pipeline facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.
