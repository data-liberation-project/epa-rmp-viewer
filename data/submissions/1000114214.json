      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nUnicold Corporation is a Hawaii based company which provides cold storage and distribution of frozen and refrigerated foods to people in Hawaii. \n\nUnicold Corporation's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Unicold has an Emergency Action Plan in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Procedures Manual maintained at the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated regularly to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Unicold Corporation was built in 1965. The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The ammonia refrigeration system uses ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, freezer storage, and food processing equipment. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe Unicold Corporation facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the appropriate building and fire codes. The Unicold Corporation ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the Unicold Corporation operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on industry guidelines and standards as well as f"

The maintenance is primarily handled by in-house refrigeration technicians; however, a professional refrigeration contractor is available on call to attend to any repairs. Unicold's ammonia mechanics and engineers are well experienced and trained. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (68.42(a)); or Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (68.42(a)).\" \n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nA well-planned emergency response program can make a tremendous difference in the potential off-site impacts of an accidental release. Swift, efficient actions can minimize the damage to both human population and the natural surroundings. To this end, Unicold Corporation has coordinated emergency response efforts with the Honolulu Fire Department and has instructed their employees on the proper actions to take in the event of an accidental release. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nThe Unicold Corporation safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items: \n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs. \n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development. \n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation. \n4. Continue internal"
