We produce products for several diverse industries including paper manufacturing, pigment mining, textile sizing, paint manufacturing, water treatment and agricultural pest control. \n\nThe Washougal, Washington facility manufactures products for paper, water treatment and agricultural markets. The portion of the plant covered by Risk Management, makes two dithiocarbamate products that are sold to other chemical companies for use in agricultural pest control and for use in wastewater treatment.  The Washougal facility is 15 years old, and  the Organics Unit producing these dithiocarbamates is about 8 years old. \n\nThe Organics Unit uses three raw materials that are covered under Risk Management:  carbon disulfide, methylamine and dimethylamine. EPA lists carbon disulfide as a Toxic; the two anhydrous amines are listed as flammables. \n\nCarbon disulfide:\n    Clear, colorless liquid with a garlic-like odor\n    Flammable in liquid and vapor form\n    Direct contact to skin and eyes will cause irritation. \n    Liquid contact to eyes can result in severe pain. \n    Inhalation of fumes can cause nausea, vomiting and headaches.\n    Prolonged exposure to high concentrations may be fatal\n\nMethylamine\n    Clear, colorless, flammable gas with a fishy odor. \n    Slightly heavier than air\n    Contact with the eyes can result in severe pain and irritation. \n    Contact with the skin can cause burns or blistering.\n    Inhalation of fumes can cause nausea, vomiting and headaches.\n    Prolonged exposure to high concentrations may be fatal\n\nDimethylamine\n    Clear, colorless, flammable gas with a fishy or ammonia odor\n    Slightly heavier than air\n    Exposure can be irritating to the eyes and throat\n    Liquid contact with the eyes can result in severe pain and corneal injury. \n    Contact with th"

At the Washougal plant, safety is each employees responsibility.  Safety is stressed ahead of production and employees are encouraged to take the extra steps and time necessary to ensure safe production and maintenance activities.  The main thrust of the safety program at washougal is the accident prevention program.  The accident prevention program addresses issues such as employee training, personnel protective equipment, plant safety audits, and life-critical procedures.  The plant has a safety committee made up of a cross-section of employees.  The safety committee meets monthly to address immediate safety concerns as well as to assess the overall safety program.  Each employee work crew conducts a weekly safety meeting.  Each employee participates in Behaviorial Based Safety, which is stressed throughout the company as well as Washougal.  \n\nThe Washougal plant works closely with South West Clean Air Agency (SWCAA) to minimize emmissions and ensure protection of the environment.  The Organics plant is a closed system.  All process vents are scrubbed at over 99% efficiency with recovered chemicals reused in the process.  The process is leak-checked quarterly.  The scrubber efficiencies are checked every five years. \n\n\nAccident history:\n\nThe washougal plant has not experienced any accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\nAccident Prevention Program:\n\nThe following lines of defense are in place at the Washougal Plant and are designed to prevent accidents, to safeguard employees, the community and environment.  The site follows PSM regulations in all areas of the plant.\n\nProcess Design:  Best engineering practices are used to assure systems operate as intended.  Materials of constr"

Special safety features include containment, ventilation and fixed-mount air analyzers.\n\nA mechanical integrity program is in place to  assure equipment quality and intergity is maintained.  Equipment, instrumentation, and controls are inspected and documented on a routine basis.\n\nThe Organics plant is PLC controlled.  Process alarms are built into the control system.  Dedicated operators monitor the process.  Standard operating procedures are in place for all phases of operation.  \n\nIf needed, operators can intervein with the process in an alarm condition.  If the operator is unable to midigate an alarm condition, interlocks are built into the control system to bring the process to a safe condition.\n\nIf the control system is unable to midigate a hazardous event, relief devices are the next line of defense.  Additionally containment is in place around all process vessels to protect the environment from chemical spills.\n\nThe final layer of protection at the Washougal plant is the emergency response plan involving both the plant and the surrounding community.\n\nIn addition to the above layers of protection, the Washougal Plant participates in the following PSM activities:\n\n   O  PHA's for the Organics plant are completed or revalidated on a 5 year cyclical schedule.\n   O  Plant changes authorized through management of change with PSUSR's conducted prior to operating the change.\n   O  Each employee receives extensive process training before operating the Organics Plant.\n   O  The PSM elements are audited internally on a bi-monthly schedule.

Severala drills are conducted annually.  Contract responders are the main responders for major incidents.  Training is extended to include these local fire and emergency services groups. Through these training exercises, we are developing partnerships. These partnerships allow us to gain confidence in each other's knowledge and abilities to deal appropriately with incidents. These shared roles in incident response are intended to assure the public, and ourselves, that we can and will react properly and promptly.
