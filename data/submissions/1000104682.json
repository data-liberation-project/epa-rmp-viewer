The operating procedures are used to:\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4 Training\n\nThe Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintained to help ensure new and refresher training is provided on a timely basis.\n\n4.5 Maintenance \n\nThe Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System properly maintains the equipment in our processes. The Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System maintenance program includes:\n\n1. procedures to safely guide workers in their maintenance tasks,\n2. worker training in the maintenance procedures, and\n3. inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before equipment fails.\n\n4.6 Compliance Audits\n\nThe Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System performs periodic (at least every three years) audits of covered processes to verify the processes are operating in compliance with the requirements of the RMP Rule. A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n4.7 Incident Investigations\n\nThe Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment. The Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation. An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8 Chemical-"

The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment. The Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel will coordinate with local emergency response agencies and first responders to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n2.0 Description of The Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. These substances are:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 90 ton rail cars and used for disinfection of the water.\n* Sulfur dioxide- stored in 90 ton rail cars and used for dechlorination of water.\n\n3.0 Hazard Assessment\n\nThe RMP Rule requires The Trinity River Authority Central Regional Wastewater System to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility. This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances sulfur dioxide and chlorine used in the disinfection and dechlorination of effluent at the facility.
