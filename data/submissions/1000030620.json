E Energy Adams was organized in 2005 for the purpose of developing, building, and operating an ethanol plant in southeast Nebraska.  Operations of E Energy Adams' ethanol plant began in 2007. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\n\n\nThe E Energy Adams' ethanol plant is located in Adams, Gage County, Nebraska.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substance under the RMP program is anhydrous ammonia. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia present at the site is 86,894 pounds, which exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nIn its original Risk Management Plan, E Energy Adams, also reported natural gasoline (used as a denaturant) as an RMP regulated flammable mixture. However, because the natural gasoline used at E Energy Adams does not have an National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 4 (it has an NFPA rating of 3), as documented by the Material Data Safety Sheet, the substance is exempt from being considered in the threshold applicability determination, as found in 40 CFR 68.115(b)(2). As such, natural gasoline is not being reported in this resubmittal.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Pre"

      "SummaryText": "vention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams has a robust prevention program which implements the prevention elements of both the Risk Management Program and the Process Safety Management regulations. E Energy Adams has developed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to identify and address potential hazards that could result in a release, such as overfilling or overpressurization of the anhydrous ammonia tank, fire, equipment failure, etc. Since the last PHA was conducted, additional pressure relief valves were installed on the slurry ammonia lines in August, 2012, as a precautionary measure. In addition to pressure relief valves, E Energy Adams' system incorporates other process controls, such as check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment, and a purge system. \n\n\n\nOther elements of E Energy Adams' prevention program include: the establishment of standard operating procedures for the anhydrous ammonia system, a training program, a management of change program, and a mechanical integrity program.\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams' Process Safety Management Mechanical Integrity Program has been developed to ensure that the proper maintenance is being performed on the ammonia system to include Preventative Maintenance (PM) procedures. PM's have been developed based on manufacturers' recommendations or best management practices to ensure that the equipment is maintained for optimal performance. Operators of the ammonia system have been given specific training on the relevant Standard Operating Procedures to ensure proper operations of said system. All operators and mechanics have also been given training on the PSM / RMP programs to ensure that they understand the safety requirements and the contents of these programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nOn August 22, 2008, an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia occurred at the facility. The release occurred during a delivery of anhydrous ammonia. When the unloading of the anhydrous ammo"

      "SummaryText": "nia was completed, the delivery driver (who was not an employee of E Energy Adams) failed to bleed off the anhydrous ammonia from the transfer hose, and upon disconnecting the hose, the driver was sprayed with anhydrous ammonia. The duration of the release was a few seconds and the amount released was approximately 2.55 pounds, which was calculated based on the diameter and length of the hose. Local emergency responders were called and they transported the driver to a hospital. The driver sustained minor chemical burns on his arms and torso. The cause of the accidental release was determined to be human error.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information:\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams has numerous accidental release programs that incorporate emergency response: Spill Pollution Controls and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC); Facility Response Plan (FRP); HAZWOPER Training; and an Emergency Action Plan. All of these programs are designed to train and give direction to employees in the event of a release of a hazardous chemical.\n\n\n\nThe facility also conducts employee training as part of facility activities.  E Energy Adams' corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public, and environmental safety, which is reflected in facility plans and training activities.\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams meets regularly with local emergency responders to communicate any changes or issues that may affect their response to an accidental release.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nE Energy Adams follows best management practices and continually reviews and updates these practices as needed. E Energy Adams is currently restructuring its Mechanical Integrity program and updating its Preventative Maintenance System. The revisions include adding best management practices and/or manufacturers' recommendations to the preventative maintenance procedures in order to make them more specific, which will in turn, help to better implement the Risk Management Program.\n\n"
