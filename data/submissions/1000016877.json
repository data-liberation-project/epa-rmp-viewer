It is BCP Ingredients policy to contact 911 (which is dispatched through the Monett police department).The local emergency planning committee and the local fire departments will be contacted by them in the event of a hazardous chemical release. BCP Ingredients has contracted an emergency response group (Environmental Management Inc.) that will respond to any hazardous chemical release requiring any cleanup operation.

Ethylene oxide is also repackaged for use in the sterilization of medical implements and spices. BCP Ingredients commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment for employees, as well as providing a safe and healthy environment for the surrounding community is supported by the incorporation of the latest technology in process controls, active mitigation, passive mitigation, and monitoring and detection systems. BCP Ingredients adheres to all applicable Federal, State, and local safety and environmental regulations for the prevention of releases of these and all chemicals.
