Ft. Worth Pool Chlor has ensured a safe operation dating back to 1995.\n\nFt. Worth Pool Chlor's manager/owner is personally committed to offer superior service and to maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The owner administers the company's safety and environmental policies. He is also responsible for various inspections to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs.  These programs include, hazard communications, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nStartup of the chlorine system occurred in 1995.  The process is located at 3156 Gertie Barrett Rd., Mansfield, Texas 76063.  The chlorine transfer process for Ft. Worth Pool Chlor consists of chlorine one-ton containers (maximum of 6) which are the storage vessels.  Chlorine liquid is dispensed from a one ton container through a filling manifold to 20 pound cylinders (maximum of 60).  The system also includes a scrubber water tank.  The maximum quantity of chlorine on site is 12,000 pounds.  The filling station is located under a canopy and behind a fire wall. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nFt. Worth Pool Chlor has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Gas Chlorinators.  In addition to the Management Programs, there is a scrubber system that is used to neutralize displaced chlorine gas while transfer"

      "SummaryText": "ring chlorine liquid.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Addendum (April 2004) the five year accident history investigation (June 1999 - June 2004) revealed that there have been no reportable releases of chlorine at the facility.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIf a release of chlorine were to occur, Ft. Worth Pool Chlor's response plan is to call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department's HAZMAT team.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency response plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nFt. Worth Pool Chlor has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (June 2004) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (May 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the audit will be completed by June 2005.  The Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation revealed that no necessary modifications are needed to ensure a safe operation. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
