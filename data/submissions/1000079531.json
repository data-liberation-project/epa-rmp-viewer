      "SummaryText": "0.1 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nSABIC Innovative Plastics US LLC (SABIC) has developed comprehensive systems and programs to assure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community. We operate in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management rule, a rigorous set of standards that govern our daily process safety control methods and behaviors.\n\n\n\nThese guidelines have been adopted to satisfy, in part, the stated policy of SABIC to safely manage our site operations and to take care of the people who work here and the community around us. We recognize that any less commitment would weaken our ability to provide jobs for our employees and to be a part of the economy of central Alabama.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan is a continuation of that effort. It shows solid integration of our plant emergency response resources and communication channels with those of the community.\n\n\n\nOur intensive, ongoing, internal reviews and OSHA's external audit process continue to validate the strengths of the programs we have in place. Our Environmental, Health, Safety, and Security (EHSS) management systems are certified under Responsible Care (RC) 14001 and ISO9001.\n\n\n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help them better understand our business and our facility. If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plant, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (334) 832-5650.\n\n\n\n0.2 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound chemical and plastics production facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our environment, our neighbors, and our employees is the highest priority. This ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation, and maintenance of our facilities.\n\n\n\nTh"

      "SummaryText": "e Burkville facility uses in its manufacturing processes some raw materials that are classified as toxic by the EPA. We are committed to 100% compliance with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards, as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain safe operation with these materials. However, we routinely go far beyond the regulatory requirements. Our operating practices and procedures provide for numerous controls that are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical. \n\n\n\nIn the event of a major release, our trained on-site emergency response organization would be activated. This organization includes a fire brigade as well as medical and chemical emergency response teams staffed with SABIC employees who have trained collectively for thousands of hours. Many of these employees serve in their community fire and emergency response organizations, devoting much of their personal time to additional drills, training, and community response.\n\n\n\nThe Burkville facility contracts with authorized fire academies and/or fire trainers to provide the Emergency Response training for our Tactical Response Team members. These contract entities have conducted training for our facility in all areas of chemical emergencies, industrial firefighting and emergency management. \n\n\n\n0.3 DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Burkville plant is located about 15 miles west of Montgomery, AL. The Burkville Team manufactures engineered plastics, marketed under the trademarked name LEXAN and CYCOLOY. Our products are used in industries including automotive, electronics, computers, compact discs and large appliances.\n\n\n\nWorkplace safety and environmental protection are part of the SABIC culture and record. SABIC has now invested some $1.2 billion in the plant for expansion, capital improvement, safety and environmental protection.\n\n\n\nCompleted in 1987, the plant occupies about 300 acres of a 6,300-acre site along the Alabama River.

      "SummaryText": "Under SABIC's stewardship, this large Alabama site has been certified as a National Wildlife Habitat. The Wildlife and Land Management Committee, an employee volunteer group, along with the assistance of a certified forester, pursues programs, including reforestation, wildlife management, and pond management.\n\n\n\nThe Burkville, AL plant uses two chemicals that are regulated under the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. These are chlorine and phosgene, and both are on the RMP list of regulated toxic substances. Chlorine and phosgene are raw materials used to manufacture our products.\n\n\n\n0.4 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION / CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSABIC has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals, known as Process Safety Management (or PSM). PSM is an integral part of working safely at SABIC facilities. PSM ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained. PSM satisfies the accidental release prevention program requirements of the RMP. Some of the many, specific safety features to prevent a chemical accident include:\n\n\n\n-Computer-controlled safety systems on the phosgene and chlorine manufacturing processes to ensure that deviations from the intended operating conditions are immediately identified and corrected; \n\n\n\n-Safety procedures, including annual training, that reduce the potential for human error, which could lead to a release;\n\n\n\n-State-of-the-art building enclosures around chlorine and phosgene equipment to contain a leak and prevent the leak from reaching the atmosphere; \n\n\n\n-Dedicated emergency safety equipment that destroys chlorine or phosgene gas in the event of an emergency release from the manufacturing process;\n\n\n\n-Dedicated control equipment that continuously destroys chlorine or phosgene gas from proc"

All of our employees and contractors are trained in the proper response to an incident. We also invest in the equipment needed to respond to emergencies, both on-site and off-site. Our trained Tactical Response Team works closely with area hospitals and other response organizations in the surrounding community. The site conducts quarterly emergency response drills, one of which includes participation by outside response agencies. In February 2019, the site had participants from over a dozen local agencies, including area fire and rescue squads, police and sheriff offices, and EMA officials, on site in response to a search an"

In addition, the site works with the community emergency response agencies to conduct drills involving our chemicals. These drills are designed to test our operations, our response team members, and the community response agencies in the proper response to such an event. In August 2018, SABIC hosted a multi-agency table-top exercise, which was coordinated between SABIC and Lowndes County EMA, to simulate the response to a catastrophic toxic chemical release of chlorine.\n\n  \n\nThirty-five members of the Burkville Emergency Response Team successfully completed the certification process and received the Pro Board Hazardous Material Awareness and Industrial Fire Brigade Certification. The process began in May 2018 and required an eight-month commitment by the members to achieve this significant accomplishment, in which they received four Pro Board certifications: Hazardous Material Awareness; Incipient Industrial Fire Brigade Member; Exterior Industrial Fire Brigade Member; and, Interior Industrial Fire Brigade Member. SABIC personnel have helped develop emergency preparedness plans for local communities. In addition, they are members of local emergency planning and emergency preparedness groups, and are active members of the surrounding volunteer fire departments.\n\n\n\n0.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nSABIC is committed to continuously improving the overall safety and environmental performance record at the Burkville, AL facility. Some of the specific planned changes aimed at improving safety are:\n\n\n\nCompletion of Process Hazard Analyses for entire plant site, including non-PSM covered processes.\n\nRe-valida"
