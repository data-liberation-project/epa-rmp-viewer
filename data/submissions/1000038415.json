It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Central City Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Linn County Emergency Management Agency will be made.\n\n\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. The emergency contact for this location is Dave Wilt, location manager. \n\n                        \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT INNOVATIVE AG SERVICES, CENTRAL CITY, IOWA:\n\n\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant. The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\n\n\nThe system consists of several large storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment.

      "SummaryText": "hout the year numerous portable nurse tanks may also be present at this site. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is six (6).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1999 with amendments and State law. \n\n\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Innovative Ag Services has extended to the Central City Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nInnovative Ag Services, Central City, Iowa has never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Innovative Ag Services Co. to immediately notify the Central City  Fire Department and the Linn County Emergency Management Agency to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Central City Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Central City location, the Fire Department with whom Central City has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.

      "SummaryText": "ire department and Linn County Emergency Management Agency. Members of the fire department and the EMA have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases on anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made before they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understand of the new hire.  Finally, the company routinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors."
