Public Receptors are defined in Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Planning. Public Receptors are located within a calculated ?Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint?, determined by a model to be the furthest point that an acute, emergency release of chlorine would affect.\n\nPublic Receptors and the Estimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint are listed in Table 1.\n\n1.3    Early Warning / Early Notification\n\nIn the event of a chlorine release from one of the Covered Sites, the following steps will be taken:\n\nAssess the Incident ? If District personnel can safely bring the situation under control, then they will do so.\n\nEvacuate the Premises ? If the release cannot be safely brought under control, evacuate the employees to higher ground upwind from the Covered Site. All personnel should meet at the designated evacuation assembly point listed on Table 1.\n\nLook Around - Before leaving the facility, verify that all others have left the premises.\n\nCall for Help ? Dial 911 and give information including facility location and telephone number, the quantity of chlorine involved, and the possible hazards to human health.\n\nHelp Injured Persons ? Help all injured persons as much as possible.\n\nReport to Emergency Response Agencies ? Upon arrival of emergency personnel, the Emergency Coordinator shall report and provide assistance as requested.\n\nNotification ? If the Emergency Coordinator determines that the situation is a threat to human health or the environment, the Tulare County Environmental Health office and the City of Visalia Fire Department is notified.\nEmergency Response Plan\nPage 2\n\nReentry ?
