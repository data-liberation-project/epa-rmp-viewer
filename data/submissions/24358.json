Chlorine gas is used for disinfection in the water treatment plant. Quantities handled or stored consist of three 2000 lb. pressurized cylinders with maximum quantity 6000 lbs. The chlorine is furnished by Vopak Cinicinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio. The product is transferred along I 64 to 801 south to US 60 then east to Airport Road to the water treatment plant. The chlorine is normally shipped in 1-ton cylinders aboard a tractor-trailer or tandem truck.\n                      Worst-case release scenarios would be gas release of 2000 lbs. at a release rate of 850 lbs/min.with duration time of 10.0 minutes.

Protective actions to be taken will be decided by local officials. The response  time to an incident at this facility  by police,fire and an ambulance should not be over 10 minutes. A evacuation radius of 10 miles was determined through the use of the EPA's Technical Guidance for Hazard Analysis based upon the release of a one -ton cylinder of gaseous chlorine.
