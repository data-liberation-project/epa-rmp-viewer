The facility management has developed an Emergency Action Plan along with training to ensure a fast and efficient response in the event of an accidental hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent a potential accidental ammonia release at any Tops Markets, LLC facilities, the Company has an ongoing review process for design and operating procedures.  This assists in ensuring the refrigeration systems comply with OSHA, EPA and all other local, state and federal regulatory agency safety standards, as well as its own internal standards.\r\n\r\nTop Markets, LLC has a emergency response training program that follows the guidelines of federal, state and local regulatory agencies.  The management believes that cooperative emergency response training must include company employees, local emergency responders and regulatory agency people in order to provide a safe workplace and a safe environment.  In an emergency, all personnel are trained to cooperate with fellow employees and other support personnel as directed by the Emergency Response Incident Commander. \r\n\r\nTops Frozen Distribution Center located in West Seneca is a refrigerated warehousing facility. The large majority of products stored are refrigerated foods for human consumption and inherently pose no known environmental or safety risks.

The OSHA PSM Program has been implemented and covers the entire scope of safe operation procedures of the ammonia refrigeration system from start-up and normal operations to potential emergency response operations and subsequent clean-up and restoration of systems.  Normal operations rely on the following:\r\n\r\nA\u00bf The Maintenance Management Procedures are used to perform preventative\r\n maintenance and to maintain records of all maintenance work performed.
