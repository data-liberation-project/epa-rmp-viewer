The Facility Policy\n\n\tThe owners, management, and employees of Heigele Custom Fertilizer Service are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an\naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\ncompany, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n  2.  Facility Information\n\n\t- Heigele Custom Fertilizer Service, 1477 Navajo Rd., Clay Center, KS  67432\n\t  (785)632-5603\n\t   2 1/2 miles south of Clay Center on west side of  Hwy 15.\n\n\t- The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n\t- Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n\t- The maximum quantity stored would be 80,000 pounds in our 18,000 gallon\nstorage tank.  \n\n  3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a\nstorage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 2.0 miles.\n\n\tb.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the\nmost likely potential incident is a release from a pipe leak.  The distance to the endpoint\n(point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n\n  4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\nStorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American\nNa"

The Five-year Accident History \n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five \t          \n\tyears that:\n\t     - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the \t\t  \n\t       facility; nor\n\t     - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, \t  \n\t       sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\t    \n  6.

Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
