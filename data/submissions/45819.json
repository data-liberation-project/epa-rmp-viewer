(SII) Tennessee Operations\n\nSchenectady International Inc. is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is reinforced by compliance with the OSHA PSM requirements through a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.      \n\nSchenectady is highly committed to decrease the likelihood that a release will occur, but unforeseeably if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel in coordination with the Cocke County Emergency Management Agency will contol and mitigate the effects of the release.  At Schenectady, control is implemented by applying layers of protection.  \n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\nThe first layer of protection is comprised of our employees who are highly trained to utilize the distributive control system to safely operate the process.  The second line of defense is implementation of our Mechanical Integrity Program which complies with the OSHA PSM rules and ensures integrity and preventative maintenance on the equipment.  Thirdly, Hazard Reviews through HAZOP Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted by examining all process procedures and equipment. The process controls and devices such as relief control valves and flares, make up the fourth layer of protection.  Backing up the controls is the monitoring system, which includes continual data readout by operators in the control room. A sixth layer of protection is provided by our Emergency Response team, which has at its disposal equipment sufficient to control a release. \nThe Cocke County Fire Department is familiar with our facilty and can provide prompt backup.     \n\n2.

This chemical is a byproduct of the chemical production process and is more commonly called isobutylene.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility is operated to comply with OSHA PSM 29 CFR 1910.119, which includes designs and mechanical integrity based on ASME standards. The operating procedures specifically address release prevention of the substance according to OSHA PSM. The site is also subject to control requirements under the EPA Title V Air Permit Program. The 2-Methylpropene storage and transfer facilities are designed according to NFPA 58 (Liquified Petroleum Gas Code). Pressure vessels are designed and tested according to State of Tennessee regulations on boilers and pressure vessels. \n\nA. Process Safety Information.\nSII maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazrds, operating safety information, operating parameters, and equipment designs.\n\nB. Process Hazard Analysis\nSII has conducted and will revalidate as needed, comprehensive studies to ensure hazards are identified and controlled. The methodolgy used to carry out the analyses are HAZOP and what if checklists. Any findings are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe procedured address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  Consequences of deviation and emergency procedures are included.\n\nTraining\nThe SII emergency response personnel are organized into teams with an Incident Commander per each shift. The personnel are all trained as 24 hours Hazmat Technicians Level.  In addition, the team members are trained as an External Fire Brigade with at least 20 additional hours of initial training.  Refresher training according to OSHA HAZWOPER is conducted each year.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nSII conduct"

These audits will be repeated at least every three years.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nEmployees participated in the PHA and pre-startup safety reviews as well as contibuted to modifying the design and procedures for the safest operation. Employees are encouraged to participate per team meetings and safety meetings.  Annually a letter is distributed asking for employee's continued input.\n\nContractors\nA detailed written program for approving, hiring, orienting, and evaluating contractors on the potential hazards in the facility is implemented at the SII plant. In the orientation contractors are trained in their role in emergencies.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nThe SII plant startedup in August 2005. There have been no emergency releases.\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe emergency response plan is written in the format of the EPA's One Plan or Integrated Contingency Plan.
