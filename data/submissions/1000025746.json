The plan summary is organized to correspond with the specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements. \r\nOverall responsigility for all facility activities including Risk Management activities, lie with the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager has delegated the following responsibilities:\r\n1.  RMP hazard assessment and document control to the Environmental Manager\r\n2.  Implementation of the RMP to the Operations Manager\r\n3.  Development and maintenance of the RMP Emergency Response Program to the Safety Engineer\r\n4.  Training and  ommunication of RMP related manners to the Operations Manager\r\nMore specific responsibilities are delegated to other staff positions as detailed in the Plant Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nSepton is committed to conduct its operations in a safe, responsible manner and reducing risks to health and the environment.

The substances are 1,3 butadiene and isoprene, both are classified as flammable materials in the RMP rule.  The chemicals are raw materils for the manufacturing of thermoplastic elastomers.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\nIn general, Septon has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential release of any chemical on site.  All storage tanks are located within dike areas; truck unloading facilities are equipped with low pressure alarms, automated shut-off valves, sprinkler systems and are located within dike areas.  Butadiene storage is equipped with a water deluge system.  Isoprene storage is equipped with a foam injection system.  All of the process areas at the facility subject to the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject ot the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  Process containing 1, 3 butadiene and/or isoprene that are subject ot the EPA RMP rule have been incorporated into the OSHA PSM Program.  Thus a program is in place that is in compliance withboth the OSHA and RMP regulations.  Specific elements of the program include the following:\r\n*Employee participation in process safety management aand accident prevention\r\n*Process Safety Information\r\n*Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n*Dcoumented Operating Procedures\r\n*Training Programs for all employees\r\n*Contractor Requirements and Training\r\n*Pre-startup Reviews\r\n*Mechanical Integrity Program\r\n*Quality Assurance Program\r\n*Management of Change Process\r\n*Incident Investigation\r\n*Compliance Audits\r\n*Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\nPrevention steps for the Worst Case Scenario consist of preventive tank maintenance, inspection and safe work practices.

Additionally, the off loading line can be shutdown downstream of the unloading site.  Operators are trained according to a coumented procedure for the unloading of butadiene.   Personal protective equipment is located at the unloading area to assure quick response to any potential spill.  Gas detectors are located in the area along with a deluge system to help prevent chance of fire.\r\n\r\nFive Year History\r\n\r\nOn Sept 16, 2010 gas detector alarm sounded in control room and it was determined that BPV-1101(Backpressure valve) was leaking ,BD and IP (Butadiene and Isoprene). System was isolated,depressured and cleared. It was determined that the cause of the release was due to overpressurization due to thermal expansion. The process system design was revised to include equipment to mitigate overpressurization due to thermal expansion.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nChemical safety is a part of the working culture at the Septon facility.  Reducing employees' and the general public's risk to chemical exposure is an ongoing effort.  Septon resolves all findings from Process Hazard Analyses, internal and external audits some of which result in process modifications."
