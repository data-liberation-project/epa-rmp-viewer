Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility is the production of ammoniated liquid micronutrients for distribution as a crop production nutrient.  The end products are packaged and most are shipped to warehouses where they are sold to end users.  Aqua ammonia (29.4% ammonia solution) is received and stored at the facility and is used for blending into other liquid fertilizer mixtures.  A scrubber is located on the liquid mixer.  The maximum stored quantity of aqua ammonia at the facility is approximately 17,000 gallons (37,390 pounds of ammonia) stored in two 9,000 gallon storage tanks (18,695 pounds of ammonia per tank) which are only filled to 8,500 gallons.  The storage tank is located within a concrete secondary containment structure that can hold approximately 17,314 gallons which exceeds the filled volume of both tanks..  The handling and storage of the aqua ammonia follows Program 2 requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program.    \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program an"

Components of the Prevention Program include identifying the safety hazards and characteristics of the ammonia, conducting a hazard review to identify best management practices, developing operating procedures, conducting training on the safe operating procedures, employing a preventative maintenance program, conducting periodic compliance audits, investigating incidents involving ammonia and maintaining documentation of the implementation of the prevention program. \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of aqua ammonia in the past five (5) years that caused deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:  In the event of an emergency, it is facility protocol to notify the local fire department and other emergency responders and request that they respond to the emergency.  Facility employees will not respond to accidental releases of aqua ammonia except for those that are small or incidental, can be controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area (e.g., shutting a valve) and do not appear to pose an immediate safety or health hazard.  This protocol has been discussed with the local fire department and the other emergency responders and the facility has appropriate mechanisms in place to notify the emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  The facility is also included in the written community emergency response plan developed under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).\r\n \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  There are no specific aqua ammonia safety changes planned at this time.  However, safety improvement is"
