The facility has two anhydrous ammonia\n\ntanks and  four  urea  ammonium  nitrate (UAN)\n\nliquid  fertilizer storage tanks.  In addition\n\nthere are two dry warehouses and a dry barge\n\nunloading facility.\n\n.\n\nB.  Accidental Release Record:\n\n\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen, Marseilles Terminal,\n\nhas an excellent safety record with no deaths or\n\nserious injuries to facility personnel since it\n\nwas constructed in 1964.\n\n\n\nThe facility safety record is the direct result\n\nof continued emphasis on safety by management,\n\nemployees, contractors, and truck drivers.\n\nThere have not been any releases from the\n\nterminal that meet the description of an RMP\n\naccidental release.\n\n\n\nC.   General Accidental Release Prevention\n\n  Policies And Activities:\n\n  \n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes safety and\n\nconcern for the environment must be second\n\nnature to all employees and contractor\n\npersonnel.\n\n\n\nThe entire Royster-Clark Nitrogen team works\n\ntogether to ensure the facility is in compliance\n\nwith OSHA's Process Safety Management standards\n\nand the accident prevention programs are\n\ncontinuously improved.  A networked computer\n\nmanagement system is utilized to provide our\n\nemployees with the necessary tools and records\n\nto maintain the safety of the process.  This\n\nteamwork is an integral part in the safety\n\nefforts of this facility.\n\n\n\nAccident release prevention steps include the\n\nfourteenelement program for Process Safety\n\nManagement, a management system, corporate\n\noversight of the facility, and a focus on\n\ncontinuous improvement.\n\n\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen encourages all employees\n\nto participate in the facility's safety program.\n\nExamples of employee participation include\n\nparticipation i"
