      "SummaryText": "        FREDERICK COUNTY BUREAU OF WATER AND SEWER\n    NEW DESIGN ROAD WATER TREATMENT PLANT\n    \n    RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nSECTION I\n\nThe Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer owns and operates several water treatment plants (WTP) in Frederick County Maryland.  This facility is the largest of the WTPs operated by Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer.  The New Design Road WTP treats about 3 mgd  and serves 11,000 residential customers and 337 commercial/industrial customers.   Chlorine, liquid or gas, is the primary disinfectant used at water treatment facilities in the United States.  Twenty-four thousand pounds of Chlorine is the maximum amount at this facility.  There are no other hazardous chemicals used or stored above reportable quantities at this facility.  There has not been a release of Chlorine at this facility. This facility is one of two Bureau of Water and Sewer facilities required to submit RMP data;  therefore, much of the data contained in this report will be similar or the same for both facilities. \n\n\nSECTION II & III\n\nBoth relief scenarios used in this report use a single container 2,000 lbs.  With the policies and procedures in place and the safety record of this facility, it is believed that this is the greatest amount that would be released in a single incident. \n\nThe first scenario was a Chlorine gas release taking place over a 10 minute period.  This 10 minute period is the estimated time that it would take for sensors to sound the alarm, personnel response with appropriate PPE and equipment, and valve or line repair or seal. \n\nThe second scenario is a rupture of a fusible plug (relief valve) with the total contents of one container emptied in an eight minute period of time. This time frame is based on the size of the fusible plug and the emptying of the complete container.\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative release scenarios were calculated using the EPA's RMP*Comp  software and the Off -Site Consequences tables.   Given the safety and accide"

      "SummaryText": "nt history of this facility it is believed that no other extensive modeling is necessary.\n\n\nSECTION IV & V\n\nThe Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer has no flammables subject to RMP therefore, no scenarios are submitted.\n\nSECTION VII\n\nThe New Design Road WTP has an excellent safety record having had no accidental releases in its 29 year history.\n\n\nSECTION VIII\n\nWhat-If & What-If/Checklists are used to update the PHA.  The last PHA was completed for this report on May 1999.  Many of the hazards identified are extremely remote yet are possible and were, therefore, listed for this report.   The What-If scenarios include environmental emergencies, human failures, power failures, and computer and equipment failure.  A Y2K review has been completed for potential impact on this facility.  In the event that Y2K problems cause a power failure or other equipment malfunction, standby personnel are planned for and backup equipment is also available.\n\nFrederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer has built redundancy into many of its critical processes.  This redundancy includes dual power and generators for power failures, duplicate pumps, controls, and sensors for other equipment.  Audible and visual alarms and procedures are in place for routine and emergency process control.  Automatic controls and shutoffs are equipped with manual backups in the event of power failures or other emergencies cause equipment failure.  \n \nThe facility has a CCTV at the main entry door and plans are to connect a perimeter monitor and call box to the gate to visually note unauthorized personnel. Chlorine containers are stored in a block structure separate from the administration and laboratory building.  This building is not ventilated and is equipped with a chlorine scrubber system (May 1999).  Chlorine detectors are stationed at critical areas and connected to audible and visual alarms.\n \nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are continually reviewed and revised as necessary.  All SOPs were r"

      "SummaryText": "eviewed for this report.\n\nThe Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer has an extensive Occupational Health and Safety program.  This program has set the benchmark for many other Frederick County Department of  Public Works safety programs.  Policies and plans are in place and training for all employees takes place throughout the year.  Currently these policies include the following: \n\n         PPE\n         Hazard Communication (RTK)\n         Emergency Action and Fire Prevention and Extinguisher Use\n         Chlorine Safety & Chlorine Repair Kit \"A\" & \"B\"\n         Emergency Response to Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Releases\n         Bloodborne Pathogens & First Aid / CPR\n         Atmospheric Testing & Respiratory Protection\n         Confined Space \n         Lock Out / Tag Out (LOTO)\n         Safe Lifting\n         Fork Lift Safety\n\nReview of all policies is ongoing with a formal review once per year. Formal review was completed for RMP submission.  An on-the-job training program is being implemented using both health & safety training and job performance check-lists for job performance evaluation.\n\nAn active employee safety committee is included in policy review.  The committee also conducts facility inspections on a periodic basis.\n\nFrederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer has implemented a Computerized Maintenance Management System for tracking of equipment maintenance both routine, and repairs.  This system allows for faster retrieval  of tracking data, planning schedules for preventive maintenance, and resource (man-hours, parts and equipment) tracking.  This system is still in the implementation stage and therefore hard copy  maintenance logs are still in use for some areas and equipment.\n\n\nSECTION IX\n\nThe Frederick County Bureau of Water and Sewer is a Frederick County agency and works closely with other Frederick County agencies to maintain its Emergency Response.  Other agencies include Frederick County Department of Fire and Rescue (LEPC), Frederick City and other Frederick County  Municipalities.  A joint disaster drill"

The Bureau's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) includes notification, evacuation and accountability requirements as well as health and safety instructions that are to be used in the event of a release.  Each facility location then is required to maintain  site specific SOPs for shut down, evacuation, notification and accountability.  A rotational on-call supervisors list is included in the Bureau's general ERP.  This on-call supervisors list includes home phone numbers, pager numbers and cell phone numbers. Each on call supervisor has a two-way radio for communication also.
