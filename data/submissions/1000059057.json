ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOperations at the Keyera Energy Inc, Hull Terminal involve storing, and transferring to market, hazardous materials that present a degree of risk.  Recognizing these risks, the Hull Terminal has an established environmental, health, and safety management system to:  \n\n?    Effectively manage our process operations;\n\n?    Invest in the latest process safety technologies;\n\n?    Educate and provide ongoing training for our people;\n\n?    Review our processes for hazards on a continuous basis;\n\n?    Ensure safety and the environment are considered in process design, installation, operations and maintenance.\n\n?     Train and maintain a highly efficient Emergency Response Organization.\n\nBy effectively managing the procedures, technology, and personnel interfaces that produce excellence in our operations, we minimize risks and thus effectively manage and minimize the impact of process related incidents.\n\nThe Keyera, Hull Terminal has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by:\n\n?    Our history of support and commitment to the community; and\n\n?    Our high environmental standards; \n\nWe are proud of our Safety and Environmental Programs and continue to strive to be among the best in industry.\n\n2.    DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Keyera Energy Inc., Hull Terminal, located in Hull, Texas, transports and stores petroleum products.  These processes contain regulated flammable substances and flammable mixtures, which may include: propane, butane, and natural gas liquids (NGL).  The Hull Terminal facility has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n3.    HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nPer the Regulations, the worst case scenario for a flammable substance is a vapor cloud explosion consisting of the entire contents for the largest vessel on-site.

The scenario chosen is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario and will reach an offsite endpoint. The Alternative release scenario for the Hull Terminal is a pump leak (either the pump seal or the hose) of a flammable substance at the Truck Lading Rack. The Leak will run for 10 minutes before the leak is detected and the process shutdown, thus stopping the leak. The vapor released will then be involved in a vapor cloud explosion with the entire contents of the leak. \n\n4.    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Keyera Energy Inc., Hull Terminal has had no accidental releases of regulated toxic or flammable substances from covered processes within the last five (5) years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n5.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTo ensure that our Risk Management Program is effectively implemented and managed, the Terminal Super indent is assigned as the role of RMP Coordinator.  The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Director, has the necessary training, experience, and resources to coordinate implementation of our Risk Management Program.\n\nThe Hull Terminal has developed programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  \n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our process management systems address each of the essential elements of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n?    Process safety information    ?    Pre-startup review\n\n?    Process hazard analysis    ?    Compliance audi"

Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be deteriorating and in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to return equipment to acceptable specifications.\n\nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes initial training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made.  As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training, including written tests and field demonstrations.\n\n6.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Hull Terminal Emergency Response Program serves as the final line of defense against accidental releases and other emergencies.  While the purpose of the other elements of the Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs serve to prevent incidents and releases of highly hazardous material, the Emergency Response Plan provides the guidelines for reacting to accidental releases and other emergencies if and when they do occur.\n\nThe Hull Terminal has a trained emergency response organization and appropriate emergency equipment.  Emergency drills and exercises are conducted and periodically coordinated with the Liberty EMS.  Emergency drills, self-inspections, and "
