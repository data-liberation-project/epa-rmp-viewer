      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Chaucer refrigeration system uses pure anhydrous ammonia (a commonly used refrigerant for industrial systems) as the refrigerant. Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by EPA. Many of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect team member and public health and safety during a chemical emergency. It is the policy of Chaucer to be in compliance with applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety at Chaucer is inherent in how anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the design of the facility incorporates a multitude of safety devices, safe handling procedures combined with appropriate training of our personnel are vital aspects to maintaining safety at our facility. We have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PSM requirements in Title 29 of CFR 1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Action Plan, consistent with Oregon Administrative Rules 432-002-0042. The Emergency Action Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties. This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to deal with unplanned events effectively.\n\n\nFacility Description and Substances Handled\nChaucer is a manufacturing facility that freeze dries fruits and vegetables. Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of the processed foods. This refrigeration process uses ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized team members, management personnel, and contractors.\n\nEmergency Planning and Response\nChaucer has a written Emergency Action Plan to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect team members and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.

This enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to deal with unplanned events effectively. This plan has been reviewed with the local responders. The refrigeration process has backup prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia-release emergencies. If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:\nEmergency Alarm and Communication System Emergency Shutdown Systems\nEvacuation Plans and Assembly Points Personal Protective Equipment\nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the local responders. Chaucer personnel will be trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency. This plan will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary by Chaucer.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with those standards applicable at that time. Chaucer has completed a process hazard analysis to identify recommendations to reduce the risk of an accident. Recommendations are scheduled to be completed before the end of 2025."
