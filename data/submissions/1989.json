The regulated substance under the RMP Rule is Anhydrous Ammonia' which is used in the refrigeration system. The is a closed loop system to maintain temperature in the facility production and storage areas. \n\nQuantity:\n\nThe facility maintains 23,000 lbs of Anhydrous Ammonia on site as an operating level for the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nChemical Hazards for:        Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nPermissible Exposure Limit--25 PPM for 8 hours\nShort Term Exposure Limit--35 PPM for 15 minutes\nImediately Dangerous to Life or Health--300 PPM\nInhalation Hazard--1,000 PPM\nSkin Aborsption Hazard--10,000 PPM\nLower Exsplosive Limit--16%\nUpper Exsplosive Limit--25%\nEPA Toxic Endpoint--200 PPM\nDOT Classification:--Non-flammable gas\nUnited Nations Number:--UN 1005\n\nWorst-case Scenario for a toxic substance:\n\nThe worst-case release toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration' reference tables and equations. This scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nVessel:                         High Pressure Receiver (HPR) 54\" x 18' 0\"\nAmount Released:        10,000 lbs.\nDuration of Release:     10 minutes\nRelease Rate:               1000 lbs/min\nWind Speed:                 1.5 meter/sec\nAtmospheric Stability:   F\nTopography:                 Urban\nPassive Mitigation:        Building Enclosure\n\nThe toxic endpoint was calculated taking into consideration building enclosure as passive mitigation. The enclosure measures 38' x 38' x 18' and has one exhaust fan rated at 3,000 cfm producing approximately 7 room air exchanges per hour. Referencing the tables in Chapter Four of the \"RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\", the toxic endpoint would be a radius of 0.6 miles.

The scenario was based on the following criteria:\n\nScenario:                          Vessel Leak\nOrifice Size:                      1/4\"\nRelease Rate:                   100 lb/min\nDuration of Release:         10 min\nAmount Released:            1000 lbs\nWind Speed:                     3 meter/sec\nAtmospheric Stability:       D\nTopgraphy:                       Urban\n\nUsing the same passive mitigation formulas as for the worst-case scenario, the release rate, from the building, was calculated at 10 lbs/min with a toxic endpoint of 0.10 miles. Affected within this area is 97 people. Also affected are several businesses and residences. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nSmith Dairy has established an in-house emergency response team to quickly respond to and handle releases of Anhydrous Ammonia. The established steps include initial training under the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER'. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an emergency. Smith Dairy has also established training with the Fire Department personnel and community Local Emergency Planning Committee. These established plans and procedures shall be periodically reviewed to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nSmith Dairy has trained the refrigeration operators and selected production and office personnel in Hazardous Waste Operation and Emergency Response 29 CFR 1910.120. The trained personnel will access each release situation and determine the appropriate emergenc"

Smith Dairy has purchased Level B Chemical Suites, Self Contained Breathing Apparatus and other appropriate equipment to support the in-house HAZMAT team. This team will coordinate their efforts with the outside emergency services to assure the safety of all.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n \nAmmonia Release @ Smith Dairy\nAugust 11, 1995 @ 11:30AM approximately 30 # of ammonia was purged into a 55 gallon drum and spilled behind the ice cream building.  The ammonia had been released in a storm sewer and in the process a frog might have been killed. The whole process started when maintenance was purging a malfunctioning air purging device in ice cream and then spilled the purged water in the ditch. EPA, LEPC and the fire department were notified. After this event all purged ammonia water has been sent to our waste treatment facility.  \n\nAmmonia Release @ Smith Dairy\nSeptember 23, 1997 around 4:30 PM a contractor inadvertently released approximately 50 pounds of ammonia. The contractors who had been installing an addition to our ammonia system left a 6 inch valve open which had been \"chained\" closed and thus the ammonia escaped. It ran down the building through our down spouts and into the storm drainage ditch. The ditch was blocked off effectively so that it did not get into the storm sewer or beyond.   \n\nAgencies contacted were National Response Center, EPA , LEPC & Orrville Fire Department. After this incident occurred the contractor was required to use a valve lockout device not just a chain as had previously been used.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nSmith Dairy has not only complied with the EPA Ris"
