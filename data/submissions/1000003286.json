Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Beaumont Chemical Plant, in Beaumont, Texas manufactures commodity building block chemicals for further refinement into plastics and chemical derivatives, as well as synthetic lube oils.  The Chemical Complex maintains a policy to be a good business partner and a safe and conscientious community member who operates the facility in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n\nThe Chemical Complex has a longstanding commitment to worker and public safety.  This is evidenced by:\n- our history of support and commitment to the community;\n- our high environmental standards; and \n- our participation as a STAR facility in the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) since 1984.  In August 2008, we were awarded our 8th STAR, and are the longest continuous Star site in OSHA Region VI.  We are listed by OSHA as a \"Star Among Stars.\"\n\nThe Chemical Complex utilizes a management system framework called Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) to effectively establish safety, health, and environmental expectations and manage operating integrity risks.  OIMS addresses all aspect of the business including security measures to prevent unnecessary on-site human exposure and to minimize the potential for any offsite exposure.  The 11 OIMS elements are: \n\n1. Management, Leadership, Commitment and Accountability\n2. Risk Assessment and Management\n3. Facilities Design and Construction\n4. Information/Documentation\n5. Personnel and Training\n6. Operations and Maintenance\n7. Management of Change\n8. Third-Party Services\n9. Incident Investigation and Analysis\n10.

Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nAs of July 2002, the ExxonMobil Beaumont Chemical O/A Plant EPA Facility ID:100000152103 and the ExxonMobil Beaumont Chemical Specialty Plant EPA Facility ID 100000061096 merged under one management control, the Beaumont Chemical Plant, and the primary SIC code changed for the combined operations.  Therefore, both sites, which are located on contiguous property, are being reported within this risk management plan.  The Beaumont Chemical Specialty Plant EPA Facility ID 100000061096 was de-registered as a single stationary source and included within this Beaumont Chemical Plant Risk Management Plant (RMP).\n\nThe Chemical Complex contains the RMP regulated flammable substances of hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene, isobutane, 2-methylpropene, butane, butene, crude butadiene, pentane, pentene, and isopentane.  Chlorine  is used for water treatment and boron trifluoride  is used for synthetic lube processes.  The Chemical Complex is organized into four business units which are the four process units:  Olefins, Aromatics, Synthetics and Catalyst.  Only Olefins, Aromatics and Synthetics are RMP covered processes.  This RMP is now organized along the lines of these three covered business units.\n\nIn December 2004 the Lube Additives Unit's storage tank was deinventoried and shutdown, removing 930,000 lbs of 2-Methylpropene (CAS # 115-11-7).  In April 2007 the Olefins Unit stopped receiving and shipping P/P Mix (Propane/Propylene) by railcars and deinventoried its associated storage, eliminating 3,300,000 lbs of flammable mixture.  Neither of these process shutdowns changed the site's flammable Worst Case Scenario (WCS) and flammable Alternate Release Scenarios (ARS).  \n\n3.

The RMP Coordinator, acting with the authority delegated directly from the Site Manager, has the responsibility for the development and implementation of our risk management programs.\n\nThe Chemical Complex has developed effective programs to comply with the industry's most stringent environmental, health, and safety standards.  Our plant adheres to the American Chemistry Council's mandatory Responsible CareA? Program.  Mobil Chemical Company was the first in the nation to have all of its facilities certified as STAR facilities in OSHA's VPP.  Facilities in the STAR program are required to demonstrate exemplary safety performance and agree to work cooperatively with OSHA to serve as an example for the industry as a whole.  They are audited by OSHA for compliance every few years.  Heritage sites in the Chemical Complex were among the first facilities in the nation to earn the prestigious STAR recognition and have maintained it through eight OSHA inspections over a twenty-four year period.\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our OIMS elements address each of the essential features of successful accident prevention programs including:\n\n- Employee participation    OIMS Element 1, 2, and 5\n- Process safety information    OIMS Element 4\n- Process hazard analysis    OIMS Element 2\n- Incident investigation    OIMS Element 9\n- Operating procedures    OIMS Element 6\n- Training            OIMS Element 5\n- Mechanical integrity    OIMS Element 6\n- Management of change     OIMS Element 7\n- Pre-startup safety review    OIMS Element 7\n- Hot work permit        OIMS Element 6\n- Contractor safety        OIMS Element 8\n- Emergency Preparedness    OIMS Element 10\n- Compliance audits        OIMS Element 6 and 11\n\nOur RMP uses these individual elements to prevent accidental chemical releases.  \n\nIn addition to our industry-leading management programs, we have"

An important tool for managing changes, for example, is our Safe Operations Committee (SOC), which is responsible for reviewing all process changes. \n\nWe employ extensive mechanical integrity and preventive maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of our equipment and safety systems.  Our mechanical integrity program uses equipment surveillance and preventive maintenance activities to identify equipment that may be in need of repair or replacement, before failure occurs.  This program also specifies the repairs (or parts replacement) needed to maintain equipment in acceptable operating condition.\n\nWe train our employees to safely perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes new employee training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process or equipment changes are made. Training is also provided special topics, such as the management of change (MOC) system.   As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the covered material, including written tests and field demonstrations.\n\n4.
