      "SummaryText": "The North Meridian Water Treatment Plant is located on the north west side of Meridian.  Construction of this facility was finished in 1998.  It has four full-time employees.  This facility houses less than 20,000 pounds of chlorine in one ton containers.  A leak detection system that senses chlorine in the atmosphere at less than 1ppm is in place with a local audio alarm and a remote notification system.  The Meridian Fire Department (Class 4) along with the Lauderdale County Emergency Management Agency are equipped to respond to chemical emergencies at this location.\n\n The accident scenerios would be the same for this plant as for the South Water Treatment Plant. In a worst case release of approximately 200 pounds/minute for ten minutes, residents in a 1.3 mile radius would have to be evacuated.  In the case of a much smaller leak, such as a broken supply line or leak around the regulator, the release rate would be approximately 74 pounds in two minutes.  Approximately 30 area resident would have to be evacuated.  This kind of a leak is very unlikely because of daily inspection and other preventive maintenance that is performed.\n\nThis plant has been operating since early 1998 and has not had any accidental releases of chlorine."
