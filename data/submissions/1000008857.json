An outline of the RMP is provided in Figure ES-1.

The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in initial and recurring operator and maintenance training. Training on process fundamentals, operations, and maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\nAn Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included. These two programs should be an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\n\nA Risk Management Plan (Plan), as required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this document. It consists of a summary of data elements that must be submitted to the EPA which will eventually be uploaded onto a public access data base. The Plan has an Executive Summary that follows a required EPA format, and is intended to inform the public of Burton Creek WWTP's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario ea"

The Hazard Assessment was conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining into which Program Level (I, II, or III) the Burton Creek WWTP falls. Residences lie within the EPA-defined endpoint concentrations of Burton Creek's Worst-Case releases. Therefore, the plant is ineligible for Program I. Because Texas public utilities are currently excluded from Program III, Burton Creek is included in Risk Management Program II.  The Hazard Assessment is provided in Chapters 1 through 3.\n\nWorst Case Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Scenarios were defined as a ton cylinder (2,000 pounds) of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, each being released by a catastrophic event within 10 minute duration. Mitigation factors of 0.55 were allowed for these processes due to the roofs and walls covering each storage area. These scenarios were developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model RMP Comp 2.01. The toxic 3 mg/l (ppm) endpoints for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide were determined to be 1.30 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Alternative Releases Scenarios of chlorine and sulfur dioxide were also modeled using RMP Comp 2.01. Source term estimations of approximately 175 pounds of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas released were derived from a scenario of a flexible connection failure. The dispersion model estimated the 3 ppm chlorine and sulfur dioxide endpoints to extend 0.10 miles.\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nLast record of incident was February 4, 2010.\n\nManagement Program\n\nThe Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below.\n\nDocument Management System\n\nA Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program.

Used as a training reference, together with the Process Schematics located in the Appendix, the reader will readily understand the function and operation of these plant systems.\n\nHazard Review\n\nA Hazard Review was conducted for each regulated process. The team consisted of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts, outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process itself. The Hazard Review technique used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a \"what if\" analysis. The \"what if\" was developed from HAZOP experience at similar wastewater treatment processes.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the Plant to implement. The Rule under 40 CFR 68.50 requires the City of Bryan to ensure that problems identified are \"resolved in a timely manner.\"  For those items that can not be promptly resolved, it is recommended that a schedule be developed that addresses those issues, with personnel responsibility assigned for each.  \n\nPlease note that these are not the recommendations of Camp Dresser & McKee Inc.  Rather, they are Plant recommendations developed by the Hazard Review Team with a consensus from all team members.  CDM's role was simply to facilitate the Hazard Review process. \n\nOne of the most significant recommendations to be generated by the Hazard Review was to investigate scrubbing and emergency containment alternatives for accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  This should be investigated as a separate scope of engineering work.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating Procedures have been developed for the Burton Creek WWTP. They provide system descriptions, specifications, and operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas systems. Procedures include Start, Shutdown, Normal, Abnormal, and Emergency Operation. Also included are Troubleshootin"

A program has been developed with guidelines on how to conduct regular and structured plant training. Training Record Forms are included with the Program for the required training documentation. Additionally, a Training Record has been compiled and included for all affected personnel associated with the covered processes.\n\nMaintenance\n\nA Maintenance Program has been developed with associated documentation forms. Sound preventive maintenance will reduce potential hazards to personnel onsite, and to the off-site public. State and federal regulators will most surely expect to see documentation and recordkeeping associated with the Maintenance Program. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAn Incident Investigation Program has been developed. The EPA has established strict guidelines to follow in the aftermath of any release involving either the chlorine or sulfur dioxide system. The Incident Investigation Program outlines key milestones that must be accomplished within 24 hours of any covered incident, and the actions that must occur subsequently. Ultimately, it is desired that the plant learn from the incident and take action to prevent similar incidents in the future. Incident Investigation Report Forms are included, and must be maintained for a minimum of five years after each incident.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nInternal Compliance Audits must be conducted every three years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in this document. The Plant Manager must certify that the Risk Management Program team has evaluated compliance with the provisions of the Program, and verify that the procedures and practices are adequate and are being followed.
