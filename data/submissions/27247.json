      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of Union Ice to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Union Ice implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Union Ice Wilmington Facility is located at 903 East ?E' Street in Wilmington, California.  The facility is situated approximately 1.5 miles east of Highway 110 (I-5) and 1 mile south of Pacific Coast Highway.  The entire facility was constructed in 2002 with operations starting in late November of the same year.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is industrial.\n\nThe primary business of the Union Ice Wilmington Facility is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 24,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the blast freezer, freezer and cooler storage rooms, and a dock area.

      "SummaryText": "cal operating conditions range from vacuum 1.6\" Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 166 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Summary\nThe worst case release scenario was that of the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel. The largest vessel, the High Pressure/Thermosyphon Receive, is located indoors and has a maximum capacity of 24,000 pounds of ammonia.  This quantity was modeled as being released in 10 minutes, in an urban setting, under pessimistic meteorological conditions (1.5 meter per second wind speed and F atmospheric stability class).  Based upon the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Exhibit 4-4 modeling method, the worst case scenario reaches locations off-site and may affect population and environmental receptors.  \n\nAlternate Release Result Summary\n\nThe alternative scenario was a release of 7,320 pounds of ammonia from a 0.25 inch diameter hole (representative of a pump seal leak, pinhole leak in pipeline, etc.) in 60 minutes.  This quantity was modeled as being released in 60 minutes, in an urban setting, using a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second and D atmospheric stability class.  Based upon the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Exhibit 4-5 modeling method, the alternative release scenario reaches off-site locations and may affect population receptors.  No environmental receptors are affected by this potential release scenario.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n    1)    OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n    2)    EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n    3)    California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP).  \n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes "

      "SummaryText": "the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Union Ice to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Union Ice's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will:\n\n50 ppm:    audio and visual alarms will automatically be activated.\n\n150 ppm:  1) The King Solenoid Valve, and the solenoid valves on the main liquid lines out of the Engine Room will close; 2) The solenoid valves located on the evaporators in the area where the detection occurred will close; 3)  If the detection w"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n? save lives;\n? minimize and avoid injuries;\n? protect the environment; and\n? minimize property damage.\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nPrior to the system being filled with ammonia, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA of the refrigeration system consisted of a:\n\n? Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n? seismic assessment;\n? series of safety checklists; and\n? Facility Walkdown.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues including wind sock locations, posting of maps, and conducting drills with facility personnel following startup."
