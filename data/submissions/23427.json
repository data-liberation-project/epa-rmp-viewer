The RMP guidelines require facilities to evaluate the consequences of certain accidents involving hazardous chemicals, to prepare a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases, and to have an emergency response program for taking action in the event of a release.\n\nProcess Determination\nWater treatment for the City of Fayetteville is provided by two separate facilities, located adjacent to each other at the termination of Manassas Mile Road (southwest of downtown Fayetteville).  The facilities include the Fayetteville Wastewater Treatment Plant and Drinking Water Treatment Plant.  The City of Fayetteville facilities have three \"Processes\" subject to U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations.\n\nThe Processes at the City of Fayetteville facilities subject to the RMP requirements include:\n\n? Chlorine Storage, Wastewater Facility (used to treat wastewater effluent)\n? Chlorine Storage, Water Treatment Facility (used for chlorination of potable water)\n. Sulfur Dioxide, Wastewater Facility (used to remove chlorine residual from wastewater stream)\n\nProcess 1 consists of the storage of 8,000 pounds of chlorine in four one-ton cylinders.  Process 2 is the storage of 6,000 pounds of chlorine in three one-ton cylinders.  Process 3 is the storage of 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide in three one-ton cylinders.  Each Process includes storage of the cylinders inside a separate concrete block building (one building for chlorine, and one building for sulfur dioxide) at the wastewater treatment plant.  At the water treatment plant, chlorine cylinders are stored in a concrete block room that is connected with the main building.  Use of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide is regulated by a series of piping and valves controlled by facility staff, and determin"

Program Level 1 is the most streamlined RMP and requires the least documentation.  Program Level 2 requires more documentation; most additional requirements concern the evaluation of offsite consequences of potential substance releases and documentation of an accident prevention program.  Program Level 3 is the most stringent RMP and requires much greater documentation of facility operations and hazardous substance procedures.\n\nA process is eligible for Program Level 1 if the facility worst-case release (defined below) does not impact any public receptors and all processes have been accident free for a period of five years.  A process must comply with Program Level 3 requirements if it is part of a certain industry (e.g., petroleum refining, chemical manufacturing) or is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) rules.  Program Level 2 is applicable to processes that do not meet the criteria for either Program Level 1 or Program Level 3.\n\nOnce the RMP-applicable processes were determined, a preliminary off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was performed to determine the maximum distance to the applicable process endpoint.  The OCA was performed using EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewaster Treatment Plants (WWTP Guidance, October 1998).  This document provides standard \"Look-Up tables\" for different accident scenarios.  The results of this evaluation were used to determine the applicable Program Level for each process (either Program Level 1 or Program Level 2 for facilities located in Georgia).  The Program Levels for the above-referenced processes are discussed below:\n\nProcess 1--Wastewater Effluent Chlorine Treatment\nThe process includes 8,000 pounds of compressed chlorine gas; the  EPA threshold for chlorine is 2,500 pounds.  The chlorine used onsite does exceed the RMP threshold quantity limit.  "

Program Level 3 is precluded, as Georgia facilities are regulated by state standards rather than delegated OSHA PSM requirements (29 CFR 1910.119).  As such, the chlorine disinfection process at the Fayetteville wastewater treatment facility is a Program Level 2 process.\n\nProcess 2--Drinking Water Chlorine\nThe process includes 6,000 pounds of compressed chlorine gas; the  EPA threshold for chlorine is 2,500 pounds.

As such, the sulfur dioxide process at the Fayetteville wastewater treatment facility is a Program Level 2 process.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to compile a five-year accident history. This is defined as \"all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\" (40 CFR 68.42).  \n\nThe City of Fayetteville has had no accidents or incidents from the covered Processes within the last five years that meet the above definition.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario Release\nThe RMP regulations require the modeling of a \"worst-case\" release of a toxic substance at a given facility.  The regulations define a worst-case scenario (WCS) as \". . .the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Section 68.22(a)\" (40 CFR 68.3).  For chlorine, the worst-case toxic endpoint is 0.0087 mg/L.  \n\nBoth the chlorine processes at the Fayetteville facilities and the sulphur dioxide process include 2,000-pound cylinders.  According to the WWTP Guidance, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide WCS assume complete release of a compressed gas from the largest containment vessel utilized in the process.  For the purposes of this modeling, the WCS would be a breach in the chlorine/sulfur dioxide cylinder during loading or switchout operations (i.e., exposed to the ambient environment outside the storage buildings).  Releases are assumed to take place linearly in a space of 10 minutes.  For a 2,000 pound cylinder, this release rate equates to 200 pounds per minute.  Using the WWTP Lookup Table, the toxic endpoint for a 200 pounds per minute release of chlorine is 3.0 miles.  The "

The endpoint for both Process 1 (Wastewater Treatment) and Process 2 (Drinking Water Chlorine Purification) are identical under the WCS, given the identical nature of storage vessels for the two processes.  Since the facilities are located near a populated area, the toxic cloud formed by the chlorine or sulfur dioxide release would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nThe WCS is extremely unlikely to occur at the Fayetteville facilities.  Cylinder loading and switchout is undertaken by trained staff; either cylinder suppliers or Fayetteville facility managers.  All employees handling cylinders during loading, unloading, or switchout procedures are trained on proper procedures and emergency response.  The cylinders themselves are constructed of steel, and are completely sealed until activation of a release valve.  A magnetic lift is utilized during loading and unloading operations to minimize the opportunity for human error.  Switchout of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide cylinders takes place only a few times a year.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nUnder Program Level 2, each RMP process must be subjected to an alternative release scenario (ARS) analysis.  ARS analysis generally includes \"more likely\" scenarios of chemical release.  Calculation of accident probabilities is not necessary under the rule.  One ARS for each toxic chemical process must be included in RMP analysis. \n\nProcess 1--Wastewater Chlorine Treatment\nIn accordance with the EPA Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Facilities,  a breach in the actual chlorine storage cylinder was evaluated.  This evaluation scenario is likely the ARS with the largest potential impact from Process 1.  This scenario assumes that the storage cylinder is compromised during handling, loading, or operational procedures.  Such a scenario could occur from faulty cylinders, catastrophic breach during loading/unloading, blown pressure gauges, and other events. This breach in t"

The great majority of the release would be in the form of chlorine gas and extremely fine liquid droplets.  For purposes of this analysis, a 3/16 inch hole in the storage cylinder was assumed.  The ARS assumes that the release would proceed uninterrupted until the entire quantity of one vessel is spent (based upon the following calculations, approximately 23 minutes).  The rate of release in this ARS is approximately 87 pounds/minute.\n\nARS calculations may also take into account active and passive mitigation measures in place for a given Process.  For Process 1, passive mitigation measures exist in the status quo.  All operational cylinders are inside a concrete block building that would likely provide passive containment in the event of a leak. \nThe RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance provides a simple building release rate multiplicative factor of 55 percent for toxic gases in alternative release scenarios (i.e., the predicted rate of release is 55 percent of that for the same accident occurring outdoors).  For the ARS in Process 1, the release rate would equate to 48 pounds/minute.  The toxic endpoint for this release in a Rural setting is 0.3 miles, or approximately 1584 feet.  Public receptors are located within this radius, including private residences.  Accordingly, the ARS for Process 1 does implicate offsite receptors, as required under the Rule.\n\n Process 2--Drinking Water Chlorine\nFor Process 2, a different type of ARS was investigated.  A potential release event in chlorine distribution areas occurs when the cylinder release valve is sheared away, producing a breach in the container integrity.  Such a valve shear can occur during loading and unloading activities, coupling/decoupling operations, or from cylinder displacement.  This ARS would produce a choked release of vapor (i.e., emerging a"

These activities expose the chlorine cylinders to the ambient outdoor environment.  A shearing of the cylinder valve during unloading activities for a 2,000-pound chlorine tank would produce a hole approximately 5/16 of an inch in diameter.  Accordingly, the release rate for the ARS equates to 15 pounds/minute release.\n\nUsing the Lookup tables provided in the WWTP Guidance, a release rate of 15 pounds/minute has a toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles (1056 feet) in a rural setting.  Under the ARS, the storage building used for cylinder containment would not function as a mitigation measure.  This ARS would implicate public receptors in the general vicinity of the Water treatment plant, including private residences.\n\nProcess 3--Wastewater Sulfur Dioxide\nFor Process 3, a breach in the actual sulfur dioxide cylinder was evaluated.  This scenario assumes that the storage cylinder is compromised during handling, loading or operational procedures.  This breach in the cylinder integrity would result in the release of both liquid sulfur dioxide (storage form) and sulfur dioxide gas (vapor flash upon contact with exterior atmosphere).  For purposes of this analysis, the 1/4-inch hole in the storage cylinder was assumed.  Utilizing the Lookup Tables provided in the WWTP Guidance (Exhibit 4-16), the release rate is 99 lbs./minute with a toxic endpoint of 0.5 mile.  \n\nFor the Alternative Release Scenarios, several measures are in place at the Fayetteville facilities that would mitigate against uncontrolled release of chlorine/sulfur dioxide gas.  Cylinders are sealed until the dispersion system is activated, making the shearing or other disturbance of a release valve unlikely.

The shutoff system takes less than 2 seconds to sense a pressure drop and seal the cylinder.  \n\nAccident Prevention Policy\nThe City of Fayetteville is committed to providing essential municipal water treatment and supply services while avoiding accidents associated with hazardous chemical storage and use.  The Fayetteville facilities have outlined operating and safety procedures in the Operations and Maintenance Manuals for each plant.  Facility staff are trained at the outset of their service in proper gas handling, use, and emergency issues.  Safety procedures are outlined for the following activities:\n\n? Initial Startup Activities;\n? Normal operations;\n? Temporary Operations;\n? Normal Shutdown Procedures; and\n? Emergency Shutdown Procedures.\n\nIn addition to initial employee training, the City of Fayetteville conducts refresher training and competency testing for each staff member assisting in gas-related operations.  Regular equipment maintenance (including documentation) occurs at each Fayetteville facility to further reduce the likelihood of accidents.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe Fayetteville water facilities have an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) in place regarding both small and large gas release scenarios.  Each is outlined in detail during initial employee training and the subject of occasional exercises to test staff competency and efficiency in implementing the ERP.
