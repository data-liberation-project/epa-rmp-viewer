It is the policy of Freeport McMoRan that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this end, Freeport McMoRan strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. Freeport McMoRan has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., personnel training, safety consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  The company's philosophy is to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as non-regulated substances. \n\n  \n\nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant activates its emergency response policies to comply with the overall Freeport McMoRan policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\n\n\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\n\n\nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is located approximately 12 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 1.5 miles northeast of the Vandenberg Village.  The nearest public road is Harris Grade Road, approximately 0.25 miles to the west.  The facility is relatively remote and bounded by undeveloped private prope"

The facility is fenced in and access is controlled by a locked gate that is manned 24-hours a day.  \n\n\n\nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is a relatively small industrial operation, occupying approximately 20 acres and consists of one Program 3 process. The Gas Plant qualifies for Program 3 because it is subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health  Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (8 CCR 5189).\n\n\n\nThe facility receives incoming crude oil and gas from an offshore platform (including some gas from onshore fields) and then utilizes several operations to produce natural gas and natural gas liquids for product.  The incoming oil is processed in the oil treating portion of the facility where water and other contaminates are separated from the crude oil before it is shipped via pipeline to a refinery for further processing.  The incoming gas is treated by removing water, hydrogen sulfide, and other heavy hydrocarbon components.  The hydrocarbon liquids which are separated out are sent to pressure vessels for storage before being trucked offsite to distributors.  The dry natural gas from the process is sold as a product.  \n\n\n\n1.3  Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane and iso-pentane are present at the facility.  There are no regulated toxic substances present at the facility in excess of the federal threshold quantities.\n\n\n\n1.4  Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n1.5  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nIn addition to being subject to RMP requirements the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions) Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \n\n\n\nCompliance with PSM's comprehensi"

The objective of the company's PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, Freeport McMoRan has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process. Using this approach the following components were considered in the evaluation:  1) the process design; 2) process technology; 3) process changes; 4) operational and maintenance activities and procedures; 5) non-routine activities and procedures; 6) emergency preparedness plans and procedures; 7) training programs; and 8) other elements that affect the process.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level.  PSM is the proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in process, procedures or equipment.  \n\n\n\n1.6  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIn addition to implementing the PSM elements, the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant utilizes specific safety features for the prevention, detection and control of releases of regulated (and other) substances.  Control and detection equipment located in and around the facility to minimize the risk of an accident involving hazardous materials at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant include:\n\n\n\n     Relief and/or safety valves\n\n     High temperature alarms and/or shutdowns\n\n     Flame detectors \n\n     Combustible Gas Detectors\n\n     Smoke Detectors\n\n     Hydrogen Sulfide Monitors\n\n     Fire Protection System\n\n     Emergency Shutdown Systems (ESD)\n\n   "

These emergency response procedures address releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address the following issues:  1) various aspects of proper emergency first-aid and medical treatment for exposures; 2) notification of local emergency response agencies; 3) evacuation plans for the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant and methods of accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation; and 4) post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant follows procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms. \n\n\n\nApplication of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with the Cal-OSHA Standard 8 CCR 3220 (Emergency Action Plans), and the emergency response element of PSM.
