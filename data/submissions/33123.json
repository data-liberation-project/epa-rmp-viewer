      "SummaryText": "The City of Edinburg Wastewater Plant accidental release prevention policy approach integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The Edinburg emergency response policy involves the preparation af a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services availabble in the community. The policy adheres to Epa Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Edinburg's Wastewater Plant is located at 1202 North M Road, Edinburg, Hildalgo County, Texas. Its chlorination building houses six, one-ton chlorine cylinders and consists of a three-walled, canopy structure facing north, and located approximately in the middle of the facility. Two operational one-ton cylinders within the walled, canopied structure are connected at any given time. One is in operation and the other is for backup. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of released chlorine. Personnel oversee the facility twenty-four hours a day, including daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage ocupies locations in the office and rescue unit approximately 25 feet from the chlorination building.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Edinburg's Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility's emergency response program. Both departments are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annnually."
