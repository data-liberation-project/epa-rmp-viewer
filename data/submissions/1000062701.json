The changes  in this RMP update  include the recently updated PHA, which has formatting changes, an improved FMEA, and a more detailed human factors review.  The RMP also includes several updated dates and executive summary.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThe facility handles two chemicals above the RMP threshold limits: Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  They are both stored in 150 lb and ton cylinders.  Neither chemical is packaged or used at this facility.\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program\n\nDue to the storage and handling of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide, this site falls under RMP Program Level 3 which includes the elements of OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management Program (Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-startup Safety Reviews, compliance audit, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work, and Contractor Safety) .  An original Process Hazard Analysis was conduct and those corrective actions have been closed.  The facility is currently conducting the Process Hazard Analysis revalidation.  More specifically the accidental release prevention program includes but not limited to access control and security of the site; checking prepackage cylinders that cross their docks for tampering and damage as per the standard operating procedure, and emergency response.\n\n4"

      "SummaryText": ". 5-Year accident History\n\nNo RMP process related accidents have occurred at this facility within the last five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response program\n\nThe facility's emergency response is outlined in their specific Emergency Action and Emergency Response Plans which includes responding to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only. The Harcros team members that handle the RMP chemicals are HAZWOPER and CHLOREP trained.  Harcros works closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and the Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nHarcros continues to participate in the Chlorine Institute's and the National Association of Chemical Distributor's programs, and although no specific safety improvements are scheduled at this time, we continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  Frequent site inspections are completed in order to identify any safety improvements.  We are planning for building upgrades (roof, siding, etc.) in the chlorine storage area."
