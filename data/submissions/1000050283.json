Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management of Fresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site makes use of the Clayton County Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n\n\n1.2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 1361 Southern Road, Morrow, Georgia. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\n\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia. One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce.  \n\n\n\n1.3.    Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the single High Pressure Receiver (a maximum of (12,196 lbs) .  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia from a ruptured evaporator coil caused by thermal expansion due to double blocking of the line.  The largest-condenser coils (EC-1 and EC-2) were assumed and a volume of 2,357 lbs of ammonia were used for release calculations.  No administrative controls or mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario even though line lockout/tagout"

Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \n\nThis includes:\n\n*    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction\n\n        and modification\n\n*    Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) at least once every five years \n\n        using accurate Process Safety Information\n\n*    Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA\n\n*    Appropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel  \n\n*    Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component \n\n        manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot\n\n        work permit programs\n\n*    Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols\n\n*    Use of qualified contractors for work on the system\n\nThe detailed Ammonia System Release Prevention Program is contained in a supporting document (revised and updated May, 2015) which is maintained at the site Safety Office.\n\n\n\n1.5.    Five Year Accident History\n\nBetween June, 2010 (the previous revalidation of the site program) and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or off-site environmental damage.\n\n\n\n1.6.    Emergency Response Program\n\nFresh Express has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.  The plan is maintained at the site Safety Office and reviewed "
