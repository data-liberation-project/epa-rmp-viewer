The RMP is required under the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Accidental Release Provisions for Hazardous Chemicals), a.k.a. Risk Management Program (RMP). The PSM Program is required under the provisions in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to identify and prevent the potential accidental release of specific \"regulated substances\" that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment outside the property boundaries.  \"Regulated substances\" are flammable and toxic chemicals and materials identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation codified in Part 68 of Chapter 40 Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  Savage Gulf Rail, LLC at Gregory, San Patricio County, Texas has quantities of two \"regulated substances\" above the 40 CFR Part 68 applicability threshold amounts listed below in Section 2 of this Summary.\n\n\n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\n\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances \n\nSection 3: Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSection 4: Five-year Accidental Release Summary\n\nSection 5: Emergency Response Program\n\nSection 6: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n \n\nEquipment at the facility must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

The Railyard portion subject to the RMP regulations is limited to a railcar temporary storage area serving the Gulf Coast Growth Ventures, LLC (GCGV) manufacturing complex operated by ExxonMobil and SABIC.  Railcars will be received by the Railyard and kept until they are moved to the GCGV for unloading.  \n\n\n\nRMP-regulated substances to be handled are limited to Butene and Dilute Propylene (which is a mixture of Propylene, Propane, and Butane).  No other RMP-regulated flammable or toxic substances will present onsite in quantities exceeding the respective RMP applicability thresholds.  The regulated substances will be found in railcars disconnected from locomotive power.    No blending or processing of the materials will take place at the railyard.\n\n\n\nThe entire area is classified as a single RMP-regulated process.  This process is qualified as a Program 2 facility per the RMP rule. \n\n\n\n3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Vice President has the overall responsibility for the site and utilizes an internal staff of Team Members, combined with environmental, health, and safety consultants to maintain compliance with all aspects of the plant's Risk Management Plan.  In addition, all plant personnel are trained to be responsible for carrying out their respective duties in a safe manner using esta"

Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters; limits for specific chemical inventories; and equipment design and maintenance information are summarized in the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe PSI is utilized in process unit hazard analyses and in inspection, maintenance and training activities.  This information is kept current by the application of management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are described further in this document.\n\n\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility conducts hazard review to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled.  Under this program, the process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  The Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility utilized the Hazardous Operation (HAZOP) methodology for the facility's first hazard review. Pertinent parameters, such as process parameters, ongoing equipment mechanical integrity/reliability and redundant safety controls were examined. \n\n\n\nIn order to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility will update and revalidate the hazard review every five-years.
