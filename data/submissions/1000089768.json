The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and initial startup of a new process.\r\n\r\nThese procedures are utilized by the experienced operators during training sessions to ensure consistent application by new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual reviews and certification.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nThe Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility's operating procedures require personnel to be trained in the safe operation of the facility processes, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), the management of potential process deviations and emergency response, if required.  Understanding of the process and how to safely operate it can minimize the potential for unplanned incidents or releases.\r\n\r\nTeam Members are trained according to the applicable requirements before they are allowed presenting in the area and receive refresher training on the operating procedures associated with the regulated chemical processes annually.\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nA comprehensive maintenance program requires routine inspection and testing of process equipment, instrumentation, and shipping containers.  Periodic reviews and auditing of the proper implementation of this program requires participation of maintenance, production, and management staff.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning as intended, the Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility will contract independent auditors at three-year intervals.

Action items or recommendations resulting from these audits are tracked to completion.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility accident investigation program covers four types of incidents:\r\n\r\n*\tPersonal injury;\r\n*\tEnvironmental release;\r\n*\tEquipment damage and loss of production caused by fire, equipment failure, or other circumstance; and\r\n*\tThose incidents that could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic event.\r\n\r\nThe goal of a formal incident investigation process is to determine the root cause associated with a release or near miss and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of a similar incident.  The investigation team is directed by a team leader who has had training in incident investigation.\r\n\r\nThe results of the investigation are communicated to all Team Members.  The Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility maintains copies of incident investigation reports for a minimum of five-years.  Corrective measures and action items resulting from an investigation are tracked to completion and documented.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nCritical to the site's prevention programs are the levels of protection intentionally designed into the process.

Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters; limits for specific chemical inventories; and equipment design and maintenance information are summarized in the Accidental Release Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nThe PSI is utilized in process unit hazard analyses and in inspection, maintenance and training activities.  This information is kept current by the application of management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are described further in this document.\r\n\r\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nHazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility conducts hazard review to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled.  Under this program, the process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  The Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility utilized the Hazardous Operation (HAZOP) methodology for the facility's first hazard review. Pertinent parameters, such as process parameters, ongoing equipment mechanical integrity/reliability and redundant safety controls were examined. \r\n\r\nIn order to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Savage Gulf Rail, LLC Facility will update and revalidate the hazard review every five-years.

The plan includes procedures to provide for prompt emergency response to include:\r\n\r\n*\tFirst aid and emergency medical treatment;\r\n*\tInitial response to emergency incidents such as fire, hazardous materials releases and natural disasters such as high winds, earthquakes and electrical storms;\r\n*\tEmergency evacuation and rescue;\r\n*\tNotification of local, state and federal emergency response agencies and the public, as required; and\r\n*\tPost-incident remediation and decontamination.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program provides training of all facility staff, which varies in level of detail based on assigned roles and responsibilities.  Routine inspections and annual drills are conducted to ensure that the program may be effectively implemented.\r\n\r\n6 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Savage Gulf Rail, LLC  Facility has a comprehensive hazard identification and mitigation program to ensure process safety.  This program includes periodic hazard reviews, investigations of near misses and audits of the process area.  Management will be notified of deficiencies or potential hazards and a mitigation plan will be promptly implemented.\r\n\r\nCurrent plans for future improvements to the operation of the site process include the use of portable air monitoring instruments for flammable vapors."
