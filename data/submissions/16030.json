Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n     In this facility we handle anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the EPA  The same properties that make anhydrous valuable to growing a good crop also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions; handling anhydrous to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health and to reduce the threat to the nearby members of the community  It's our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State regulations  Our safety measures depend on the manner in which we handle anhydrous along with the safety devices applied to the design of our anhydrous facility  We also rely strongly on our safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel\n\n     Our emergency response program is based upon the IFCA ( Illinois Fertilizer and Chemical Association) compliance checklist, (How to Properly Respond to an Agrichemical Release) but is tailored in such a way to fit our specific needs  It is the purpose of our program to establish an orderly system to assure that responsible parties are adequately prepared to respond to the release of chemical substances into the environment and to improve the ability of state and local authorities to respond to such a release\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\n     The primary purpose of our anhydrous facility is to distribute anhydrous to our retail customers  Anhydrous is used by our customers as a valuable source of nitrogen for their crops  The anhydrous is received by truck transport and is stored in (1) 30,000 gallon bottle  Anhydrous is then distributed to retail customers by transporting the product to a smaller bottle (1000 gallon or 1500 gallon bottles) which is attached to a running gear\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario"
