      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE:\n\nThe Perdue Farms, Perry Poultry Processing Complex is located at 250 Highway 247 Spur in Perry, Georgia. This Complex processes broilers and other value-add fresh and frozen poultry products and employs approximately 2,400 associates in two plants. The facility normally operates 24 hours a day, five days per week.\n\nThe regulated substance at the Perry facility covered by 40 CFR Part 68 is anhydrous ammonia (R-717). The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as an integral part of its refrigeration system. The refrigeration system consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping, and air handling units located throughout the facility, in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is approximately 189,000 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact. A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe conditions and safe practices.

      "SummaryText": "a wide variety of environmental, health, and safety training to its staff.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Perdue Farms Perry facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. The maintenance personnel at the facility utilize a preventative maintenance program for all the system components. As part of the program, trained refrigeration personnel routinely inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and conduct routine maintenance as needed.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThe facility is reporting two ammonia release incidents that occurred with the past 5 years.  Neither of these releases resulted in any injury or deaths nor were there evacuations or shelter in place off site.    While these releases did not meet the criteria as RMP reportable, Perdue has opted to include these releases in the five-year accident history.\n\nAn ammonia release occurred on 4/25/2022, lasted 33 hours, and resulted in a release of 6,540 lbs.  This release was found to be a result of the failed LLTS header piping (System 2).\n\nThe second release occurred on 5/12/2022, lasted 12 hours, and resulted in a release of 1,294 lbs.  This release was found to be a result of the failed LLTS header piping (System 2).  \n\nThe facility upgraded the piping in this portion of the system in response to these releases.   Subsequently, System 2 has now been decommissioned and all ammonia removed from the system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration system, Perdue's Perry facility has a well-defined incident command system. The written Emergency Response program includes procedures to safely evacuate the facility, minimize and/or contain the release, and notify the appropriate local fire department and LEPC officials. Perdue continues to train our associates on hazardous responses and awareness, and conduct mock dr"

Currently, there are no specific planned changes."
