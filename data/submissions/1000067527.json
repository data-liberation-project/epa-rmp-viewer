To this end, the management actively supports the implementation of safe work procedures for all aspects of the operations, including the processing of the one regulated substance:  hydrofluoric acid, greater than 50% by weight (AHF).  The facility follows the regulation and intent of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n\nThis facility utilizes AHF as an integral component of the manufacturing operations of inorganic compounds and refining of nonferrous metals.  AHF is delivered to the facility in tank trucks.  Delivered AHF is unloaded into one of three bulk storage tanks.  During delivery, AHF trucks are flange-connected at the unloading fill station and compressed air is used to off-load the acid.  At all points during delivery, a qualified facility employee and qualified personnel from the supplier remain with the delivery truck.  From the bulk AHF storage tanks, measured quantities of AHF are pumped into process vessels in four buildings.  During the transfer of AHF to the process vessels, AHF if added to water and the concentration of AHF immediately drops below 50% by weight and is no longer regulated by RMP.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, facilities that contain a regulated substance (such as AHF) at quantities exceeding the RMP threshold must consider the impact of a worst-case and an alternate-case release of the substance. In 2008, GAM utilized the Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) model developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as, EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance reference tables and equations to determine the potential impacts of both release scenarios. GAM has reviewed the input parameters utilized for the 2008 ALOHA model runs and has determined that the parameters continue to be representative of"

EPA's MARPLOT software and other publicly-available resources were utilized to update the residential population and the public and environmental receptors for the 2018 OCA.\n\n\n\nAs part of this facility's commitment to provide a safe work environment, GAM has implemented a number of programs to enhance safety.  Pertinent PSM & RMP information is communicated to plant personnel weekly to review plant safety, health and environmental issues.  General awareness AHF training is given to all employees and contractors.  Operators of AHF systems receive additional site-specific training.  Components of AHF systems are covered under a Mechanical Integrity program to assure that they operate safely and are physically sound.  Appropriately detailed standard operating procedures (work instructions) are in place for start-up and shutdown of the processes in both normal and emergency situations.  Information on chemicals, process technology, and equipment has been compiled.  Changes to the processes are reviewed under Management of Change procedures.  Pre-Start Safety Reviews are conducted prior to the implementation of any process change. Contractors receive extensive safety training prior to beginning work in the facility and receive additional site-specific safety training for their assigned work area.  Competence of contractors is assured as part of the contractor selection process.  Hot work and other safe work permit programs are in place in the facility.  Process Hazard Analyses using the HAZOP methodology are conducted to identify potential hazards and areas for improvement.  Any incidents are investigated to determine the root cause and identify changes to prevent recurrence.  The Risk Management Program is outlined and discussed in a PSM/RMP program document in use at the facility.\n\n  \n\nGAM demonstrates its commitme"

All incidents and near misses are reported and investigated to identify root causes with corrective actions directed at preventing reoccurrence.  Investigation results are communicated to all on-site employees and contractors for awareness.  GAM has an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to assure safe response to incidents involving AHF and other chemicals.  The EAP is reviewed and updated when a significant change to a chemical system occurs.  All employees and contractors are trained on the notification and evacuation procedures detailed in the EAP.  GAM maintains an on-site Emergency Response Team that responds to significant chemical incidents.  The team is trained to administer the specialized, medically-approved AHF first aid protocols.\n\n\n\nThe facility's EAP establishes a written procedure to follow during a major chemical release.  The procedure calls for a facility evacuation and notification to the National Response Center, Berks County LEPC, local community emergency responders, and PA DEP.  The EAP contains procedures to alert facility personnel of the danger potential, a list of emergency contacts, evacuation procedures and assembly points, and the procedures to be implemented in the event of a fire.\n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, GAM has not experienced an accidental release that meets the criteria under the Risk Management Program regulations for inclusion on the five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nIn summary, GAM is fully committed to the safe storage, use, and operation of its AHF processes and systems.  GAM is committed to continuously improving the overall safety, health and environmental performance at the Boyertown facility.
