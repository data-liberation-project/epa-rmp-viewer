      "SummaryText": "ease scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nEPA's RMP regulations required the Honeywell Baton Rouge plant to model the dispersion and off-site impacts of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride which would be released to the atmosphere in the event of a hypothetical worst case release scenario occurring at the Baton Rouge plant.  The Honeywell Baton Rouge plant's worst case scenario is the hypothetical failure of a tank containing a maximum of 240,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.  As required by EPA's regulations, the worst case scenario air dispersion modeling assumed that the resulting spill from the tank could not be controlled by the facility's anhydrous hydrogen fluoride spill mitigation system (described more fully below) and, furthermore, that the entire 240,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride spilled would vaporize in 10 minutes.  Under these unlikely assumptions, the toxic cloud formed by the vaporized hydrogen fluoride would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors under certain meteorological conditions assumed in the air dispersion modeling required by EPA.\n\nFor a number of reasons, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur. The anhydrous hydrogen fluoride spill mitigation system includes an automatic remote shutdown system that deploys valves that fail closed and diverts the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to separate emergency containment dump tanks.  Operations personnel are in continual attendance of the process.  There are 1000GPM positional water spray mitigation towers that when deployed contain all vapors that may leak.  Our professionally trained Emergency Response Team has mutual aid capability from other local industries and the Office of Emergency Services. \n\nEPA's regulations also require the modeled dispersion and off-site impacts of hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, chloroform, difluoroethane, and trifluoroet"

The alternate release scenario for the Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant involves a small weld failure in an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride pipeline, which results in a five-minute release.  Mitigation of this type of release would automatically occur through the automatic shutdown system with fail close valves.  The second alternate release scenario is that of a small flange failure of a chlorine line.  Due to the activation of the automatic shut-off valves the duration of the release would be five minutes and will be mitigated by use of a water spray.  The third alternate release scenario of chloroform involves a pump seal failure which releases chloroform to a sump.  It would be mitigated by activation of a manual shutdown system and a water spray.  The fourth alternate release scenario involves a release of difluoroethane from a broken two-inch diameter pipe.  Mitigation would include an automatic remote shutdown and water spray mitigation.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant for the affected stationary sources includes the following elements:\n\na) established process safety management system for oversight and control of the manufacturing processes,\nb) computer controlled processes with sophisticated interlock and shutdown protocols, \nc) development and implementation of accurate written procedures for safe operation and maintenance of the process. \nd) An on-going mechanical integrity program that ensures critical process equipment is designed, constructed, installed and regularly tested in accordance with recognized codes and standards.\ne) Formalized, documented inspection protocols integrated with preventive and predictive maintenance programs,\nf) performance of process hazards analyses"

Maintenance procedures were reviewed, revised, and refresher training conducted. \n\nThe emergency response program:\nThe Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility's stationary sources.  The plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental release of the materials that we handle.  The Plan provides for both internal plant and external community emergency alerting and notification with multiple means of communication identified.  The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire Department who would direct all offsite community notification activities. The Honeywell Baton Rouge plant maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases of hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, chloroform, difluoroethane, and trifluoroethane.  The ERT conducts quarterly emergency response drills and exercises.  Annual in-house audits of the plant's emergency response system are performed.
