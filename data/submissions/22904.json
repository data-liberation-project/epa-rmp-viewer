The code requires safety audits, inspection and maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers.  Facilities are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems. The Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant produces fluorine hydrocarbon chemicals used as refrigerants and non-ozone depleting substitutes.  Our products, such as our long-term, non-ozone depleting replacements 407C and AZ-20, are used as refrigerants in home, automobile, and commercial air conditioners, and refrigeration units such as supermarket freezers, display cases, and ice machines.  Other Honeywell products, such as HCFC 141b and 142b, are the leading substitute blowing agents for rigid foam insulation for construction, appliances, and transport vehicles.

The Honeywell Baton Rouge plant's worst case scenario is the hypothetical failure of a tank containing a maximum of 240,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.  As required by EPA's regulations, the worst case scenario air dispersion modeling assumed that the resulting spill from the tank could not be controlled by the facility's anhydrous hydrogen fluoride spill mitigation system (described more fully below) and, furthermore, that the entire 240,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride spilled would vaporize in 10 minutes.  Under these unlikely assumptions, the toxic cloud formed by the vaporized hydrogen fluoride would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors under certain meteorological conditions assumed in the air dispersion modeling required by EPA.\n\nFor a number of reasons, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur. The anhydrous hydrogen fluoride spill mitigation system includes an automatic remote shutdown system that deploys valves that fail closed and diverts the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to separate emergency containment dump tanks.  Operations personnel are in continual attendance of the process.  There are 1000GPM positional water spray mitigation towers that when deployed contain all vapors that may leak.  Our professionally trained Emergency Response Team has mutual aid capability from other local industries and the Office of Emergency Services. \n\nEPA's regulations also require the modeled dispersion and off-site impacts of hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, chloroform, difluoroethane, and trifluoroet"

The alternate release scenario for the Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant involves a small weld failure in an anhydrous hydrogen fluoride pipeline, which results in a five-minute release.  Mitigation of this type of release would automatically occur through the automatic shutdown system with fail close valves.  The second alternate release scenario is that of a small flange failure of a chlorine line.  Due to the activation of the automatic shut-off valves the duration of the release would be five minutes and will be mitigated by use of a water spray.  The third alternate release scenario of chloroform involves a pump seal failure which releases chloroform to a sump.  It would be mitigated by activation of a manual shutdown system and a water spray.  The fourth alternate release scenario involves a release of difluoroethane from a broken two-inch diameter pipe.  Mitigation would include an automatic remote shutdown and water spray mitigation.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant for the affected stationary sources includes the following elements:\n\na) established process safety management system for oversight and control of the manufacturing processes,\nb) computer controlled processes with sophisticated interlock and shutdown protocols, \nc) development and implementation of accurate written procedures for safe operation and maintenance of the process. \nd) An on-going mechanical integrity program that ensures critical process equipment is designed, constructed, installed and regularly tested in accordance with recognized codes and standards.\ne) Formalized, documented inspection protocols integrated with preventive and predictive maintenance programs,\nf) performance of process hazards analyses"

The second incident involved a minor inhalation of chlorine when a valve that had been improperly cleaned was dissembled.  Maintenance procedures were reviewed, revised, and refresher training conducted. \n\nThe emergency response program:\nThe Honeywell Baton Rouge Plant has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility's stationary sources.  The plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various contingencies including specific actions for responding to an accidental release of the materials that we handle.  The Plan provides for both internal plant and external community emergency alerting and notification with multiple means of communication identified.  The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response and control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and with the local Fire Department who would direct all offsite community notification activities. The Honeywell Baton Rouge plant maintains its own professionally trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases of hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, chloroform, difluoroethane, and trifluoroethane.  The ERT conducts quarterly emergency response drills and exercises.  Annual in-house audits of the plant's emergency response system are performed.  The plant is equipped with an extensive underground fire water system supplied by 1500GPM and 1000GPM fire pumps drawing from dedicated fire water tanks totaling 325,000 ga"

Honeywell Baton Rouge plant works in full cooperation and coordination with the Office of Emergency Services.  Honeywell provides support for the installation of the Community Alert System (CAL), the community warning system of sirens, loudspeakers, and automatic telephone notification.  The Plant serves as a member of the Greater Baton Rouge Industrial Task Force, and the Greater Baton Rouge Industrial Management Association. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nThe most recent process hazard analysis of the Honeywell Baton Rouge plant was completed in 2001.  As a result of this systematic safety review, several action items were identified and implemented to improve upon the existing safeguards at the plant and to further reduce the potential for any accidental release.  The process hazard analysis for the hydrogen fluoride, chlorine, chloroform, difluoroethane, and trifluoroethane stationary sources will be revalidated every five years.
