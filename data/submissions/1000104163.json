Three(3) railcars, on average, are typically present at the site at any given time; however, a maximum of 5 railcars may be stored at the site to support plant operations. These railcars are unloaded into an aboveground storage tank that has a capacity of approximately 200,000 gallons and is filled to 80% capacity or 160,000 gallons. This tank is located inside a concrete containment structure designed to hold the entire contents of the tank in the event of an accidental release. The plant's South Butvar Department utilizes vinyl acetate as a key raw material in the production of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resin. This resin is the primary ingredient in the manufacture of a plastic sheet (interlayer) that is sandwiched in laminated safety glass for automotive and architectural applications. A significantly smaller Day Tank of approximately 5,000 gallons capacity, is utilized to support daily production needs.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs, process safety management systems, and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of vinyl acetate and all other chemicals at the site.\n\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n- Worst-Case:  South Butvar - Release of full contents of a rail car of Vinyl acetate (195,000 pounds), which had been in the sun, heating the VAM to 80F.  Released at rate of 4,510 pounds/min - 43 minutes.

In 1963, Monsanto acquired the Shawinigan Resins facility on the opposite side of Grochmal Avenue, creating the current site. The plant took the Indian Orchard name in 1982 and following a spin-off from Monsanto in 1997, Solutia Inc. was formed. The site includes manufacturing units producing high-value specialty products that include Saflex interlayer, and Butvar resin. The site also includes a Technology Center, complete with research laboratories and pilot plant facilities, finished product warehouse buildings, wastewater collection and neutralization facilities, a powerhouse, analytical laboratories, and office buildings. In addition, Ineos Melamines, and MassPower each own and operate facilities within the borders of the Indian Orchard site. Soca USA, leases a former warehouse building from Solutia to house a small recycling process they own and operate at the site as well. The Adhesives Department that was owned by Cytec Industries, Inc. (but operated and maintained by Solutia employees), was permanently shut down by October 1, 2014.  As a result, the processes related to the Adhesives department have been removed from this RMP.  The entire plant occupies approximately 250 acres and Solutia currently employs approximately 380 people from the greater Springfield area and the surrounding communities. Additional employees for Ineos Melamines, MassPower, Cytec Industries, and Soca USA also work at the site. \n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nIn our current production processes, we use only one chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release; vinyl acetate monomer.\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is shipped by our suppliers as a"
