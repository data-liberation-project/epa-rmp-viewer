It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the KNIERIM Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\r\n\r\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\r\n\r\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the KNIERIM, Iowa location is RICK JUD, location manager. His work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24-hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT NEW COOPERATIVE, INC., KNIERIM, IOWA.\r\n\r\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.

The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three (3) months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\r\n\r\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the largest storage tank, in this location, a rail car, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\r\nThe alternative release scenarion involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer  hoses. The resulting release (according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program) has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\r\n\r\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of KNIERIM, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State law.\r\n\r\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.

In the unlikely event that the KNIERIM Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our KNIERIM location, mutual aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire departments) will be summoned.
