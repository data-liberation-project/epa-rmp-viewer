Our safety strategy revolves around our \"Do It Right\" value and permeates our business in three key ways:\r\n\u00bf\tRobust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\r\n\u00bf\tSuperior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\r\n\u00bf\tEngaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\r\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\r\n\r\nPalmyra Terminal and the regulated substances handled:\r\nPalmyra Terminal stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia. The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than the threshold quantity are anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nThe Palmyra Terminal has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68.
