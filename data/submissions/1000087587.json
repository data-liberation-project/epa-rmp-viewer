This facility is located at 725 State Road in Ashtabula Township. At this facility, GPP manufactures a variety of specialty organic chemicals. The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs approximately 85 full-time employees.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (? 68.155(a)):\n\n\n\nIt is Gabriel Performance Products (GPP) policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, as well as industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, GPP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management Standard. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Ashtabula Plant.\n\n\n\nThe RMP at the Ashtabula Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n\n\n*A hazard assessment to help understand: (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases; and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n\n\n*A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n\n\n*An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\n\n\nInforma"

In fact, the Ashtabula Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental management program in place that complies with ISO 14001 and 45001, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as preventing injuries and damage from such a release.\n\n\n\nGPP's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Ashtabula Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, GPP reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and/or Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for new installations, as well as modifications of existing processes that handle hazardous materials.\n\n\n\nGPP strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility: GPP implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment. Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, GPP requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. GPP's mechanical integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify "

GPP utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. GPP trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, GPP works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  GPP has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Ashtabula County, Community Awareness and Emergency Response Plan (AC-CAER).\n\n\n\nAshtabula Plant's emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, Ohio and EPA regulations. This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Ashtabula Plant. If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Ashtabula County-CAER Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\n\n\n\nGPP is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness. In addition, the Ashtabula Plant demonstrates community commitment by providing involvement and leadership in important local organizations such as the local Safety Council. The Ashtabula Plant was a founding member of the Community Advisory Panel (CAP), which was formed in 1994. Safety is a primary concern in our facility and throughout our organization.\n\n\n\n2.

The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (? 68.155(c)):\n\n\n\nThe Ashtabula Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario.\" However, GPP does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nALOHA 5.4.7 and MARPLOT were used for evaluating the endpoint distances for the worst-case scenarios and the alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst cases and average meteorological values for the alternative release scenarios. The MARPLOT program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within endpoint distance from the storage location and to identify the public and environmental receptors located within this distance.
