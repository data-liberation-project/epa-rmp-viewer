In this scenario, the largest vessel containing ammonia is catastrophically ruptured, resulting in the loss of the entire tank contents over a ten-minute period.  This scenario has off-site consequences.\n\nFlammable Substance Worst Case Scenario\n\nAcetaldehyde constitutes the Kingsport site's flammable worst case scenario.

Of the seven, only five had off-site consequences that affected people or a designated receptor.  The ARS for each of these is the rupture of a 2-inch connection to the largest vessel containing the substance in question.\n\nFlammable Substance Alternate Release Scenario\n\nFor each of the five flammable substances at the Kingsport site, an alternate release scenario (ARS) was estimated.

This approach includes, but is not limited to the following elements\n\n   Designing For Safety\n\n- Designs are analyzed for safety prior to their installation, and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management program.  All RMP covered processes are Level Three processes.  11 of the 12 RMP chemicals at the Kingsport site are covered by the Process Safety Management regulation (29 CFR Section 1910.119).\n\n   Operating Safely\n\n- All operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the plant are trained and qualified in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\n- Extensive use of automated safety and backup systems are used to prevent the accidental release of chemicals due to misoperation or process upset.\n\n   Maintaining Safe Operations/Auditing Our Operations\n\n- Process systems undergo a safety inspection on a routine annual schedule that includes safety reviews and inspections, adequate piping support, adequate labeling, valve and pipe joint leaks, and pipe and equipment condition.  Any discrepancies and defects are corrected before further use.  A routine inspection program helps to ensure the integrity of equipment in a given operating system.\n\n   Training\n- Operators are initially trained on the specifics of the process they will be running.  Refresher training is supplied at least every three years.\n\nIn addition to the above elements, the Eastman Kingsport Site is a State of Tennessee Volunteer Star site.  The Volunteer Star program, administered by the State of Tennessee Department of Labor, is Tennessee's version of the federal Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a cooperative effort between employers and OSHA to improve worker safety and recognize outstanding safety performance and program"

Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, the Tennessee Eastman Division has had only one RMP reportable incident. In 1998, the Tennessee Eastman Division experienced a release of 200 gallons of anhydrous ammonia to the air and to the Holston River, which had an adverse affect on some aquatic life.  There was no impact on either plant personnel or the community.\n\n\nVI. Emergency Response  Program\n\nGeneral Emergency Response Practices for All Chemicals:\n\n1. Eastman emergency response personnel use a computerized modeling system to predict the concentration and location of any vapor cloud resulting from a hazardous vapor release.  The system is able to provide real-time monitoring of the weather to enhance protection of anyone who may be impacted in the plant and in the community.\n2. Response is coordinated with emergency response agencies in the community via a Field Command Post and a Control Center.\n3. Eastman's emergency response crews use a multi-tiered emergency response plan to enhance reaction time and effectiveness.  For vapor releases that might impact the community, a direct line to city and county central dispatch services is available.  Sirens are activated and local radio and TV stations are notified.\n4. Emergency response personnel are regularly trained to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements.\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nImprovement plans fall into three primary areas:\n\n1. Hazard Analysis-Continual identification of potential hazards and prompt implementation of corrective action will be done in accordance with applicable regulations and as a matter of company policy.\n\n2. Incident Investigation-Prompt, thorough investigation of all significant incidents and near-misses will be conducted using root cause failure analysis (RCFA) techniques, and learnings will be shared across the company.\n\n3.
