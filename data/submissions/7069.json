These trucks are Department of Transportation (DOT) approved for transportation of \nbromine.  Bromine is unloading into a 1000 gallon lead lined steel bulk storage tank using nitrogen pressure off-loading.

All bromine bulk storage is located within concrete diked areas that are enclosed and continuously monitored for bromine vapors (continuous air monitoring systems are in place for each bulk storage and processing area.  Each storage facility is equipped with a water deluge system and ammonia gas delivery system to neutralize vapors.  The concrete containment dikes maintain a layer of water (or water blanket) which, should a release of bromine enter the dike, the water will suppress any bromine vapors thus providing passive mitigation.  The bromine handling system (bulk tank, receiver and reactor) is vented to a scrubber to prevent atmospheric discharges.  Water fog nozzles are located at the tank truck unloading containment area for additional active mitigation and suppression of vapors.\n \nLiquid bromine is transferred from the 1000 gallon bulk storage tanks by nitrogen pressurization into  \nreceiver vessels.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nLord Corporation operates a Chemical Products Division manufacturing facility in Saegertown, PA.  \nBy policy, Lord Corporation is committed to operate our plants and facilities in a manner that protects\nthe environment and the safety and health of our employees and the public.  In pursuit of our corporate \npolicy, the Saegertown manufacturing facility has evaluated every Risk Management Planning listed \nchemical onsite and developed individualized risk reduction plans as follows:\n\n7 Bromine - improved passive mitigation to prevent offsite consequences.\n7 Chlorine - reduced onsite storage below threshold quantity so that only general duty\n compliance is required.\n7 Toluene Diisocyanate - converted from bulk storage tank to drum storage so that no reasonable release \nscenario exceeds threshold quantity so that only general duty compliance is required.\n7 Hydrochloric Acid - all uses from purchase through disposal do not exceed the compliance \nconcentration of 37 percent.   \n\nOur commitment to protect our employees and the public from accidental releases includes safety\nreviews, alarms, emergency training, active mitigation, and passive mitigation.  Both plant and corporate \nemergency teams are available to respond to an emergency release.  Equipment available to team \nmembers includes pagers, cell phones and laptop computers.  Personal protective equipment available \nincludes chemical resistant suits and supplied air respirators. \n\nAccess to the site is restricted (24 hour site security/guard service) to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.
