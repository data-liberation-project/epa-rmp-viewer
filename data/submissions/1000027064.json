This Executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\n2. Stationary source activities\n\n3. Regulated substances handled\n\n4. Release scenario analysis\n\n5. Accidental release prevention program\n\n6. Five-year accident history\n\n7. Emergency response preparedness program\n\n8. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n9. Summary\n\n\n\n[This is a new facility that was started up in April 2004.  The ammonia refrigeration system was expanded and a Program Level 3 Risk Management Plan was put in place before increasing the ammonia on site to greater than 10,000 pounds.]\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIt is General Mills' policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual that documents safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response preparedness.  In addition to the PSM Manual, the Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, and an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the fiver-year accident history. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.  Stationary Source Activities\n\n\n\nThe Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant is located in Rutherford County, Tennessee.  The facility produces and packages yogurt and stores in an adjacent refrigerated warehouse (operated by Americold) prior to shipment.  Ammonia is primarily used to provide chilling of glycol that is used as a secondary coolant for various process cooling.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\n3.  Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration system at the Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant is a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule; the yogurt plant ammonia system is comprised of 6 separate packaged ammonia chillers that individually would fall under general duty requirements only; however, collectively and due to the proximity of each other in the same engine room and sharing some controls and venting systems, are considered a full PSM covered process.  The packaged ammonia chillers are a closed loop which recirculates and reuses the same material.  Infrequent makeup to the packaged chiller units is only to replace material lost due to maintenance activities, including intermittant manual purging.  The yogurt plant ammonia system consists of vessels, compressors, chillers, condensers, safety relief systems, ammonia detectors and alarms.  All leaks are addressed and the packaged system charges are maintained at intended levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  Release Scenario Analysis\n\n\n\nRelease scenarios were analyzed using Appendix E: Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities of the EPA's GENERAL GUIDANCE ON RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION (March 2009) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998). A worst-case release scenario was defined to determine the potential emergency response procedures needed for the facility and community; however, it is important to empha that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.  On the other hand, the alternative release scenarios are based on credible assumptions.  The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios from the Ammonia Model RMP and is representative of a pipe, valve or flange gasket leak.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.  Prevention Pro"

      "SummaryText": "grams\n\n\n\nFor the Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant ammonia system, General Mills followed the ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur.  Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the yogurt plant ammonia system.  The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment design and the technology of the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) - An initial PHA was conducted to satisfy general duty PSM requirements in February 2004 and revalidated in January 2005 in preparation for startup of the expanded system.  The hazard analysis of the ammonia process is re-validated at least every 5-years.  Recommendations made by the most recent PHA team to improve the safety of the systems are being addressed to further reduce the risk of an accidental release or incident.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the yogurt plant ammonia system and for safe work practices.  Safe work practices include the use of ammonia personal protective equipment, lockout/tagout procedures, confined space entry procedures, safe use of motorized vehicles around ammonia equipment, and access control to critical areas.  Operating procedures are reviewed and re-certified annually to make sure they are current.\n\n\n\nTraining - Training is provided to each yogurt plant ammonia system operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system.  The company follows the IIAR Ammonia Refrigeration Training Guidelines.\n\n\n\nMaintenance - All of the covered ammo"

Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Bulletin 109 and a company developed mechanical integrity program.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure is followed for all changes made to the yogurt plant ammonia system, including the safety systems, to ensure that the system safety and integrity are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR) - Pre-startup reviews are conducted whenever a change results in a change to the PSI.  Checklists are used to direct the PSR process.  The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup of new or modified systems. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - An initial compliance audit was conducted in April, 2006 and at least every 3 years thereafter.  The most recent audit was completed in August, 2010 and findings and recommendations for improvement are being addressed.  All findings from earlier audits have been addressed.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - General Mills routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant.  An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of an incident and to help them develop measures to prevent recurrence. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has been conducted for all affected employees.  Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures is an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit Program - A hot work permit program is being used at the Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia sy"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has been no release of ammonia from the Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant in the last five years that meets the RMP reporting criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.  Emergency Response Preparedness Program\n\n\n\nThe Murfreesboro Yoplait Plant has an emergency response preparedness program which is described in the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic exposures to ammonia.  The facility has an on-site trained hazardous material (hazmat) team for responding to ammonia releases, isolate, and minimize off-site consequences.  The ERP is coordinated with the Murfreesboro Fire Department and the Rutherford County Emergency Management Agency and consistent with the county hazmat response plan.  The facility conducts annual drills with community first responders.\n\n\n\nThe facility has conducted risk management plan communication meetings with employees and has notified immediate offsite receptors.  A public communications meeting was held on May 28, 1999 in cooperation with the Murfreesboro Fire Department and the Rutherford County Emergency Management Agency when an RMP was initially submitted in 1999 for the adjacent main production plant which has its own covered ammonia PSM process and risk management plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.

Summary\n\n\n\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia system according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner.  The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs.  General Mills has developed an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated through the local response agencies and has communicated the information in this Risk Management Plan to the local community.  General Mills corporate and plant management are committed to safety and implementation of safe procedures and practices for both Prevention and Preparedness."
