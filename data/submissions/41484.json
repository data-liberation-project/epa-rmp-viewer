      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the KMG Gathering LLC (KMG) Dougan Compressor Station (Station.)  The station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nKMG has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention.  KMG has an extensive operator and maintenance training program.  Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  KMG?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, KMG personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, KMG will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. \n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nKMG's Dougan Compressor Station (Station) is located in Weld County about three and one quarter miles east of old Highway 85 (Road 27) on WCR 10 in a rural area which is used primarily for farming.  The Station consists of one compressor unit, #21, that discharges 30 MMCF/D through glycol dehydration to delivery points via 16\" and 20\" cleanable pipelines.  The discharge pressure is not to exceed 1,220 psig.  The station is equipped with inlet separation.  Liquids separated (water and heavy hydrocarbons) go to four 225 barrel storage tanks.\n\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines and to reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission.  Each compressor station receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transport the gas to a processing plant. Control of the dew point is critical since the incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons) that should be removed.  The amount of moisture in the gas "

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 41484,
      "SummaryText": "varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the wells. The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\nAs gas flows through the pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding environment.  If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will tend to condense.  The resulting formation of liquids can begin to restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe.  In extreme cold, the liquids may form hydrates, a potentially dangerous ice plug.  In order to reduce the dew point of the gas and potential formation of hydrates, the inlet gas flows through a ?slug catcher? and ?inlet separator? where liquids are separated physically.  The gas is then compressed which causes some of the heavy hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw, natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into either a tank truck for transportation or pumped into a liquids pipeline.\n\nAfter compression, the gas is subjected to a liquid desiccant, Triethylene glycol (TEG), to further remove water.  The glycol is regenerated and used again.\n\nThe Station?s maximum intended inventory of flammable substances in a mixture is larger than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of regulated flammable substances.  Therefore, the Station is subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Company in the early 1970's.  HS Resources purchased the facilities from Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy (KN), in December of 1999.  KN operated the facilities from April 1993 through December 1, 1999. .  KMG acquired HS Resources in August, 2001.\n\nProgram Level\n\nKMG has determined that Program Level 3 applies to the Dougan Compressor Station.  The Off Site Consequence Analysis reveals"

      "SummaryText": " that there is a \"public receptor\" within 0.3 mile of the calculated endpoint for the worst-case scenario.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Station has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the general public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes.\n\nAccident History\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no accidents that meet the criterion for inclusion in this submittal.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee safety meetings that focus on various safety issues, such as flammable substances, are held regularly.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards through KMG?s ?Near-miss? program."
