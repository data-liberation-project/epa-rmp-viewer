Products are  shipped via truck on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n1.2.1. \tThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n1.2.2. \tAnhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the Process System. Approximately 17,000 pounds of ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system.  The ammonia is contained and used in various vessels, compressors, piping, and evaporators used throughout the refrigeration process.  A single machine room houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery, vessels, piping and motor control centers.\r\n\r\n1.3.\tWorst Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\n1.3.1.\tAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25(b)(1) the worst-case release scenario was calculated and the results are on file at the Perfomance Foodservice-Thoms Proestler facility. \r\n\r\n1.4.\tAlternate Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\n1.4.1.\tThe alternative release scenario was also calculated according to the EPA guidelines and is on file at the facility. \r\n\r\n1.5.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\n1.5.1.\tPerfomance Foodservice-Thoms Proestler is equipped with an emergency information system.
