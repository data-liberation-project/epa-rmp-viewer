Storage consists of two tanks totaling 50000 storage capacity.\nThe worst -case scenario.\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud floating over the ground until it disperses.

The total affected population would be 3087 people involved with residences, industry, businesses, and schools.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specfic prevention steps.\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained according to OHSA, federal, state, and local regulations. \nFive-year accident history.\nThe United Cooperative Association has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused a death, property, or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\nThe emergency response program.\nIn the event of an emergency involving our annhydrous facility, it is our policy to notify the Luana Fire Department and the Clayton County LEPC and request th"
