      "SummaryText": "Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two most commonly used substances for treating wastewater.  The County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (CSDLAC) Whittier Narrows Water Reclamation Plant (WNWRP) uses chlorine (for chlorination) and sulfur dioxide (for dechlorination) for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  For this reason, WNWRP follows all industry recommended practices for safely storing and handling these chemicals.  WNWRP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  The following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information.\n\n* Offsite consequence analysis results.\n\n* Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n* Five-year accident history summary.\n\n* Emergency response program summary.\n\n* Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the WNWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County WNWRP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

The CSDLAC has prepared a HMHWCCP for the WNWRP for storing and handling hazardous materials, including chlorine and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The HMHWCCP has been coordinated with the local response agency (County of Los Angeles Fire Department).  The WNWRP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Whittier Narrows Water Reclamation Plant is located at 301 N. Rosemead Boulevard, in South El Monte, California.   The treatment facility is located on a land area of approximately 27 acres, bounded on the west side by the Rio Hondo, on the south side by the San Gabriel Boulevard, and on the north side by the Whittier Narrows Recreation Area.  The CSDLAC has operated WNWRP facility since 1962.  The design treatment capacity of the plant is 15 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd).  The wastewater treated at WNWRP originates mainly from approximately 150,000 domestic users in the San Gabriel Valley region; a small fraction is of industrial origin.  Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with chlorination and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent for purposes of re-use and/or discharge.\n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is received in chlorine trailers and transferred to a bulk storage ta"

The chlorination system consists of one chlorine bulk storage tank, three backup 1-ton containers, chlorinators, residual detectors, diffusers, chlorine contact tanks, piping and other equipment.  The capacity of the chlorine bulk storage tank is 16 tons; however, the maximum quantity of chlorine present in the tank at any given time is only 13 tons.  There is a Chlorine Gas Detector Panel located in the Chemical Storage Room in the Control Building.  A second Chlorine Gas Detector Panel is located on the south wall outside the Chlorination Room.  The Chlorine Gas Detector Panel continuously analyzes samples of air taken from the Chlorine Storage Room and Chlorination Room as well as the vent lines from the Pressure Regulating Valves.  When chlorine is detected in any of the above mentioned areas, the gas detector sends a signal to alarm annunciator on the main Control Panel, actuating the alarm assigned to the event.  Since this facility is only manned 8 hours a day, after hours this alarm will trigger both the 'VERBATIM\" and 'SCADA\" alarm systems to notify personnel at the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant (SJCWRP) of the leak situation.  It also sets off an audible alarm, during normal working hours only, and flashing warning lights at either the New or Old Control Buildings and throughout the plant.  A malfunction of the leak detector activates an alarm, which is separate from the leak alarm.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide system consists of one sulfur dioxide bulk storage tank, two back up 1-ton containers, sulfonators, ejectors, diffusers, a residual chlorine detector, and piping and other equipment, most of which is located in the Old Control Building.

The sulfur dioxide gas detector continuously analyzes air samples taken from the sulfonator room and the sulfur dioxide storage room as well as the vent lines from the Pressure Regulating Valves.  Sulfur dioxide analyzer detection and response are similar to that of the chlorine analyzers, which is described previously.\n\nAccess to the WNWRP is through gates, which are closed and locked after regular hours. The buildings housing the chlorination and dechlorination facilities are locked except when operation and maintenance personnel are working inside the buildings.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nRMP and CalARP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.  For the worst-case release scenario analysis for the WNWRP, two scenarios were considered: (1) rupture of one chlorine tank with a maximum capacity of 13-tons, resulting in a release of 26,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10-minute duration, (2) rupture of one sulfur dioxide tank with a maximum capacity of 13.5-tons, resulting in a r"

Administrative controls are used to limit the filling of the chlorine bulk tank to only 13 tons and the sulfur dioxide tank to 13.5 tons. The release rates for chlorine and sulfur dioxide were thus estimated to be 2,600 pounds per minute and 2,700 pounds per minute (lbs/min), respectively.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine/sulfur dioxide is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  In practice, this type of a total failure of bulk storage tanks would be unlikely.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (111 deg F), and average relative humidity (61%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the air dispersion analysis indicated that the toxic endpoint distance would be longer for the release of sulfur dioxide in comparison to chlorine release.  However, the worst-case release scenarios for both chemicals have offsite impacts.\n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.

Active mitigation is defined as requiring mechanical, electrical, or human input.\n\nBased on the process hazard analysis performed for both the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems, two alternative scenarios were selected for the offsite consequence analysis.  \n\nThe scenarios selected for the WNWRP chlorination and dechlorination systems involve the release of chlorine/sulfur dioxide gas from the monel flexible hoses connecting the storage tanks to chlorination and dechlorination processes.  These scenarios can occur if the operator uses a flex hose, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine/sulfur dioxide gas from the storage tanks.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 1-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.1875-inch (3/16 inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak by the chlorine/sulfur dioxide detectors installed at the chlorination/dechlorination facility.  It is assumed that a maximum of sixty minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond.\n\nThe chlorine release rate was estimated at 4.3 lb/min and the sulfur dioxide release rate was estimated at 2.0 lb/min.  Since the chlorine and sulfur dioxide gases are dense gases, EPA's DEGADIS 2.1 model was also used for the air dispersion analysis.  The meteorological conditions used for the alternative release scenario analysis were Stability Class D, wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, average air temperature of 64 deg F, and average humidity of 61%.  The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the distance to the toxic endpoint would extend offsite but would not reach the nearest residence or any other public receptors. \n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of these scenarios is highly unlikely because the flex hoses are inspected and pressure tested every two years.\n\nFinal"
