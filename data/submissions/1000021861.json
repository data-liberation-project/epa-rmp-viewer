We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n* A five-year history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n* An overview of our emergency response program.\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Johnson Matthey facility manufactures chemical products containing platinum group metals.  These products are commonly referred to as homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts and other specialty chemical compounds.  Spent materials containing precious metals are also processed and refined to the pure element using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  Our processes use the following chemical that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics:\tChlorine\n\nChlorine is stored in one ton cylinders as a pressurized liquid. The liquid chlorine is vaporized to a gas, which is distributed to the manufacturing area and used in our processes for dissolution of precious metals.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs, in effect since 1988, and our contingency planning efforts allow us to effectively manag"

Our plan, written to meet the New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act, consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  Relevant site personnel are trained on the plan's contents and it is coordinated with the community emergency response plan.\n\nIn addition, we maintain an emergency response team on site.  The team is trained and properly equipped to respond to hazardous material releases and specifically chlorine.  The team trains on a periodic basis, which includes a minimum of one simulated drill per year in conjunction with local fire, rescue and emergency management agencies.    \n\nOur overall program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe chlorine safety systems have evolved to the current level over the many years that the New Jersey accidental release program (TCPA) has been in effect.  The most recent changes to the system involved the following:\n\n* Updates to the computerized process control system.\n* Replacement of automatic cylinder electrical shutoff system with a new more dependable pneumatic shutdown system.\n\nOur site is investigating an improved chlorine cylinder transfer system to further reduce risks associated with moving cylinders."

A management system has been prepared which includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our risk management program.  As part of our system, roles and responsibilities have been assigned to facility personnel.  Our system also addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Process hazard analysis\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical integrity\n* Management of change\n* Pre-startup review\n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n* Employee participation\n* Hot work permit\n* Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n* Building enclosure for vaporizing process.\n* Monitoring devices to activate a ventilation system in the building with exhaust air venting to a scrubbing system. \n* Monitoring devices in cylinder storage area and manufacturing process areas with automatic shutdown of the chlorine system.\n* Excess flow detection with automatic shutdown of the system.\n* Remotely operated shutoff valves.\n* Preventive maintenance programs for process equipment and piping.\n* Hazards analysis\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Johnson Matthey and its employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our standards for accident prevention.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
