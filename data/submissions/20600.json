This commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Midkiff gas plant is located about 40 miles south southeast of Midland, Texas.  The facility includes compression, amine gas treating, dehydration, electrical power generation, and an expander plant for the low temperature recovery of natural gas liquids.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, a mixed natural gas liquid stream (NGL) and a gasoline/condensate stream.  The liquid products contain ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier components.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  The plant uses an amine process to remove carbon dioxide and traces of hydrogen sulfide.  This facility does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\nThere are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Midkiff gas plant.\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) at the Midkiff facility is release of flammable substances from a gasoline/condensate storage sphere which form an unconfined vapor cloud explosion.   This scenario pertains to a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage sphere containing gasoline/condensate.  The content of this tank amounts to about 2,735,200 pounds of materi"

      "SummaryText": "al.  This amount of material is presumed to release, vaporize and ignite resulting in the VCE.  Using the RMP Comp software, the maximum distance to the 1.0 pound per square inch endpoint for this WCS was calculated to be 1.1 miles.  Originally, this distance included several residences and therefore the facility was considered to be a program level 3 facility.  The residences included in the 1.0 psi overpressure area consisted of homes in a work camp owned and operated by Western Gas Resources.  This camp has been closed and all residents have relocated away from the facility.  Additionally, a softball/baseball field which was located near the camp has now been closed.  Because of these closures, there are now no residences or other public areas located within the calculated 1.0 psi overpressure area.  For this reason, we are resubmitting the Risk Management plan to lower the Program Level from a level 3 to a level 1.  \n\nIn the original calculations to determine the possible affected area, , no credit for passive mitigation measures or controls were taken, inspite of the fact that numerous controls and prevention measures are built into the process and operation at the facility.  It should also be noted that this tank rarely operates full, though this is volume is used in the WCS calculations.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) of flammable substances at the plant, is not required as a program level 1.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process and employee safety issues.  These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices and participation in flowsheet reviews. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Midkiff gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n The Midkiff gas plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Midkiff gas plant uses the process hazards analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  These reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nIf necessary the PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and reva"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Midkiff gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Midkiff gas plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\n\nContractors\n The Midkiff gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the Midkiff gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\nThe Midkiff gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance mechanism by verifying that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Midkiff gas plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provides a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel, the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\nSafe Work Practices\n The Midkiff gas plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) a lockout/tagged procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, 3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, 4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e. hot work), and 5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nThe Midkiff gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.
