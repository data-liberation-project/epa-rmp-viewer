      "SummaryText": " CHANGE\n\n \n\n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.75 of the RMP Rule, the facility evaluates and approves or rejects proposed changes (i.e., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through the management of change (MOC) program. This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that process safety information is updated, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The facility uses this close scrutiny of all changes to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.\n\n \n\n 7.1 Management of Change Details\n\n \n\n The facility analyzes each proposed change and confirms that:\n\n \n\n-    The technical basis for the change is appropriate.\n\n-    The safety and health impacts of the change are understood, and appropriate controls are in place.\n\n-    The procedures are modified as appropriate for the change.\n\n-    The permissible time period is established for temporary changes. The change is authorized by appropriate personnel.\n\n \n\n Our MOC procedure contains a step-by-step description of the confirmation process. It defines and provides examples of changes and replacements in kind.  Also, it describes in detail the requirement for each confirmation step based on the type of change being considered.  The facility uses a Management of Change form to document each step in the confirmation process. Changes that pass the confirmation criteria are communicated to the employees who are affected by the change before the change is implemented. When approved changes require updates to the process safety information and/or operating procedures, the facility revises these documents and trains employees on these changes before operations resume. All training and notifications are documented.\n\n \n\n \n\n"

The pre-startup safety review is completed before regulated substances are brought into the process and only after the facility has confirmed that:\n\n \n\n-    Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n\n-    Safety, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate\n\n-    PHAs have been performed on new stationary sources and all recommendations have been resolved\n\n-    MOC requirements have been satisfied for modified processes\n\n-    Training has been completed (and documented) for affected employees\n\n \n\n The facility uses a Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist as an aid in documenting the performance of the pre-startup safety reviews. The checklist contains a list of safety questions covering process considerations that must be addressed prior to start up. The person responsible for the project prepares the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form and provides the names of the reviewers responsible for confirmation of each of the pre-startup safety review questions. Each reviewer signs off on the Checklist and Approval Form when satisfied that all assigned safety questions are reviewed, and no problems exist. All reviewers must sign off on the Pre-Startup Safety Review Checklist and Approval Form before starting up can be authorized.\n\n \n\n 9.0 COMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n \n\n In accordance with 40 CFR 68.79 of the RMP Rule, the facility audits the RMP-covered processes to be certain that the prevention programs are effective.

The facility integrates these audits into PSM audits. The audit teams consist of a team leader and an appropriate number of team members based on the size and complexity of the processes to be audited. The audit team collectively possesses the following skills and knowledge:\n\n \n\n-    Ability to understand the prevention program requirements of the RMP regulation (40 CFR Part 68)\n\n-    Capability to conduct interviews and collect audit data\n\n-    Capability to document audit results\n\n-    Knowledge of the process to be audited\n\n \n\n The audit team members receive training in RMP regulatory requirements, interview techniques, and methods for data collection before participating in an audit. They use a protocol or a check sheet that contains a series of questions that systematically address each requirement of the RMP regulation. The team leader assigns each auditor specific RMP elements to cover in the audit. Information obtained through field observations, interviews, and document reviews is documented, and deficiencies or noncompliances are identified. At the conclusion of the audit, the audit team prepares a report that identifies any specific noncompliance issues that need to be addressed.\n\n \n\n The facility promptly reviews the audit findings, determines an appropriate response for each finding, assigns responsibility for implementation of a corrective action, and assigns a target completion date. The corrective actions are placed in a tracking system and progress is monitored quarterly until open issues are resolved. The facility ret"

The facility trains employees to identify occurrences requiring investigation and to notify the appropriate person should such an event occur. If any incident occurs, including those that meet RMP classification criteria, the facility initiates an investigation within 48 hours. The facility assembles an investigation team consisting of:\n\n \n\n-    At least one person knowledgeable in the process or activity involved\n\n-    A contract employee if the incident or near miss incident involved the work of a contractor or had acute, adverse health effects on contract employees\n\n-    Others with appropriate knowledge and skills to thoroughly investigate and analyze the event\n\n \n\n The facility trains investigation team leaders in investigation techniques, including root cause analysis. The investigation team follows a written investigation protocol that addresses the key steps of fact finding, determination of cause, and development of corrective actions to be taken. From the raw data collected, the incident investigation team prepares the text for an incident summary report, which contains:\n\n \n\n-    Date and time of the event\n\n-    Date and time the investigation started\n\n-    Description of the event\n\n-    Identification of contributing factors\n\n-    Corrective actions from the investigation\n\n \n\n Th"

The bid information includes their current safety programs (i.e., safety organization, employee education and training, and accident prevention program) and their prior safety performance (i.e., OSHA injury rates, property loss experience, regulatory compliance history, and worker's compensation insurance experience). Bidders that do not provide all of the requested information, that do not have the desired skills, or that have an unsatisfactory safety record, are dropped from further consideration. If a contractor currently working in the plant is under consideration, the facility reviews recent safety audits and contact the facility's people on the job site to verify satisfactory job performance before the facility authorizes the purchase order.\n\n \n\n The facility provides a safety orientation for all Contractors before they begin work on site.
