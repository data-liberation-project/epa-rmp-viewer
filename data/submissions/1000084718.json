The facility provides initial training to new operators before they are allowed to work independently as operators.\r\n \r\n Periodically, at least every three years, the facility provides the operators with refresher training that, depending on job classification, can include operating procedures training, equipment-specific training, and/or advanced (beyond HAZCOM) chemical-specific training. The refresher training courses emphasize process overview information, safe work practices, operating procedures that are rarely used such as emergency shutdown, emergency operation and start up following an emergency shutdown, and any operating issues requested by the shift group. The operators are consulted annually with a written questionnaire on the frequency of refresher training, and their input is documented and considered when preparing training schedules.\r\n \r\n All training is certified by some form of evaluation to verify that the training has been understood.

This program helps ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that process safety information is updated, that affected procedures are updated, and that employees and contract employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. The facility uses this close scrutiny of all changes to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, or the environment.\r\n \r\n 7.1 Management of Change Details\r\n \r\n The facility analyzes each proposed change and confirms that:\r\n \r\n-\tThe technical basis for the change is appropriate.\r\n-\tThe safety and health impacts of the change are understood, and appropriate controls are in place.\r\n-\tThe procedures are modified as appropriate for the change.\r\n-\tThe permissible time period is established for temporary changes.
