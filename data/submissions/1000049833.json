Although ammonia vapors are lighter than air in some cases ammonia will hug the ground and drift. \r\nA\u00bf\tAmmonia has excellent warning properties which may allow escape before concentrations affect health.

The worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 5.6 miles from the center of the plant.  Public receptors are located within this 5.6 mile radius.  For denaturant the worst-case scenario at the facility is the release of 660,040 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case scenario is based on a release from the entire denaturant tank and both final denatured ethanol storage tanks.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.7 miles from the center of the facility.  Public receptors are also located within the 0.7 mile radius.\r\n  \r\nAlthough Sterling Ethanol, LLC has numerous controls in place to prevent such a release and to manage potential consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\r\n\r\nSince Sterling Ethanol, LLC qualifies as a Program 3 du"

The ARS is the release of 541,000 pounds of denaturant creating a vapor cloud explosion, which are the contents from just the denaturant tank.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the facility.  The ARS for a toxic release of anhydrous ammonia is a leak for a 10-minute duration.  The ARS endpoint is approximately 1.3 miles from the center of the facility.

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nSterling Ethanol, LLC (Facility ID: 100000193266)\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Sterling Ethanol, LLC Ethanol Plant is located near Sterling, Logan County, Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from dry-milled corn.  The primary activity at the facility is the production of fuel grade ethanol.  Processes involved in this activity include a) the receiving and milling of corn, b) liquefaction of the milled corn to produce mash, c) fermentation of the mash to produce beer, d) distillation of the beer to produce ethanol, and e) denaturing of the ethanol.  \r\n\r\nThe regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (natural gasoline) which are considered a toxic substance and flammable mixture, respectively. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and used in the liquefaction process to adjust pH levels. The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 102,420 pounds in one storage tank. Denaturant is added to the ethanol at the end of the process so the final product is not fit for human consumption.\r\n\r\nSterling Ethanol, LLC has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release would be approximately 5.6 miles; due to the amount of anhydrous ammonia stored on site.  The radius of impact for a worst-case denaturant release is approximately 0.7 miles.\r\n   \r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nSterling Ethanol, LLC is committed to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nSterling Ethanol, LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond"
