The Tanner family started out in the ammonia\n\nbusiness in 1954 with the purchase of National Ammonia Company in Philadelphia, PA. The\n\ncompany has grown to its current through the acquisition of three other ammonia companies, Bower\n\nAmmonia and Chemical Co. in 1971, Northeastern Ammonia Co. in 1985, and Hamler Industries in\n\n1991. This particular facility was established in 2015.\n\n\n\nThe mission of Tanner Industries, Inc. is to constantly improve our products and services to meet or\n\nexceed our customer's needs, to distribute our products in a safe, secure, efficient and\n\nenvironmentally responsible manner, and to generate a reasonable return in order to provide\n\ncontinuity for the business and employment for our employees.\n\n\n\nTanner Industries, Inc. is firmly committed to a fully effective implementation of the Risk\n\nManagement Plan (RMP) as it applies to the safe distribution of ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "ustries, Inc. is a distributor of anhydrous ammonia. We are not a manufacturer. The\n\nmaterial is transported to our facility by tank truck and then distributed to end-users. At this facility, we also distribute a product we call \"Aqua Ammonia\". This material, ammonium hydroxide, is a solution of ammonia and water. This material, like the anhydrous ammonia, is also distributed via tank trucks.  \n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\n\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. The largest\n\nusers of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a\n\nfertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia and other chemicals and nutrients to form\n\nmore complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles,\n\npharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used\n\nby some companies in various processes. Ammonia is recognized as an \"ozone safe\" refrigerant.\n\nThis means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, Ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\n\n\n\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\n\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.\n\nAccompanied with a very pungent odor, ammonia can be said to be \"auto-repulsive\". These\n\ncharacteristics provide us with an early warning of the material's presence and force us to retreat\n\nfrom ammonia contaminated atmospheres. High concentrations could have more serious health\n\neffects. These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in\n\nextreme cases, death. Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce\n\nserious chemical burns requiring prompt me"
