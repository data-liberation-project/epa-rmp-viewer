The area is bounded on the north by woods, on the east by a railroad switching yard, on the south by farmland and on the east by several residences. \n\n\n\nThe facility's one covered process is comprised of storage tanks and bulk loading and unloading facilities for hydrofluoric acid.  This process is essentially a mixing and repackaging process where 70% Hydrofluoric Acid is mixed with 30% Hydrofluoric Acid to make 49% Hydrofluoric acid.  This mixing occurs in Tanks #1 and #2.  Both 70% and 30% acids are offloaded from the tanker through Yamada Air Diaphragm pumps.  The 49% Hydrofluoric acid is then transferred to Tank #3.  All three tanks contain 8,700 gallons and transfer the 49% Hydrofluoric Acid using 2.00\" T-Mag Magnetic drive pumps powered by a 3 HP motor.  All three tanks can be used to fill tankers.  Only Tank #3 can fill drums and totes.  Tanks are located both inside of a building and outside.  Each of the tanks are located in secondary containment and are piped to a scrubber unit to prevent hydrofluoric acid vapor from being emitted to the environment.  NOTE: For the sake of evaluating the worst case, all of the tanks were considered to contain 70% hydrofluoric acid.  \n\n \n\nWorst Case and alternative release scenarios and administrative and mitigation controls in place to limit the impact of a release\n\n \n\nEPA's Risk Management Program requires Brainerd Chemical Midwest, LLC to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemicals covered by the RMP regulation.  EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place instantaneously and that all safety systems fail to opera"

For a number of reasons, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.  In addition, the Brainerd Chemical Midwest, LLC is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for the chemicals covered by the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for a \"worst-case release scenario\" was performed for a full tank of hydrofluoric acid, which was presumed to be 70%.  The offsite consequences for each identified scenario were modeled pursuant to EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for hydrofluoric acid was identified as a release from an above ground storage tank.  The contents of one tanker, 36,000 pounds, was assumed to be released instantaneously to the atmosphere followed by the creation of a vapor cloud. There would be an offsite impact from this release with a toxic endpoint at 0.8 miles.  This release would be captured in a sump that would contain the liquid and prevent it from free flowing off site and also limits the surface area that would be available for vaporization.   \n\n\n\nBecause of the safety systems and prevention programs in place, the plant focused emergency planning resources on release scenarios that, although unlikely, represent some potential for occurrence.  The facility evaluated process hazard analyses conducted on the regulated processes and reviewed incident histories to identify potential release scenarios.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has also conducted an alternative scenario when a smaller amount (30,500 pounds) which would result from a hole being punched in a tank by a fork truck or similar equipment.  The spill is still released into a secondary containment unit and resulted in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.6 miles.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrainerd Chemical Midwest, LLC's five year accident history:\n\n \n\nA review of the plant's incident records"

There have been no incidents, accidents, or injuries associated with the storage, transport or other handling of these chemicals within the past five years.  \n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\n \n\nBrainerd Chemical Midwest, LLC has an emergency preparedness planning and response program designed to deal with accidental releases and other unplanned events associated with the facility's use of hazardous chemicals.  The plant has a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses various types of contingencies including specific actions for responding to accidental releases.  The Plan provides for both internal plant and external community emergency alerting and notification using established protocols.  The plant has multiple means of communication established to alert public safety agencies.  The plan addresses emergency health care, sheltering in place, evacuation, emergency responsibilities, response, control procedures, and emergency equipment.  The Plan provides for the implementation of an Incident Command System to direct and coordinate the Plant's response activities.  The Plan has been coordinated with the local emergency planning committee that would direct all offsite community response activities.  The plant maintains a trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) which is knowledgeable and prepared to respond to incidents involving accidental releases.  The ERT holds annual plant emergency response drills and other regular training exercises. \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nBrainerd Chemical Midwest, LLC pursues a philosophy of continuous improvement in all aspects of its operations.
