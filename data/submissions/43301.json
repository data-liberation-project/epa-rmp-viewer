We also have a commitment to act as responsible neighbors in our communities. We will accomplish our commitments by adhering to all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility has developed an emergency response plan and has coordinated activities with the Orange City Fire Department.\n   This facility produces meat products that are for market distribution and ultimately for public consumption. Anhydrous ammonia is the only substance over the threshold quantity stated in CFR 40 part 68 code that is in use at the facility. The ammonia is used in the mechanical refrigerating process to cool or freeze the product and production areas. The system includes several pieces of equipment. They are: but not limited to, pressure receivers, condensers, compressors, pumps, chillers, associated piping and valves.\n   The worst case scenario involves a failure of the High Temperature Receiver vessel, resulting in a 37,000 pound ammonia release over the course of ten minutes. According to the look-up table provided in the EPA's guidance document for ammonia refrigeration systems the distance to the endpoint of the scenario is 3.6 miles. Public receptors identified within the 3.6 miles include residences,schools,recreational areas, and commercial/industrial areas. No environmental receptors are located within the distance to the endpoint. An alternative release was also examined. It involved a release from a failed pressure relief valve with the vessel under normal operationing parameters. The quantity released would be 9,800 pounds over a time period of 94 minutes and under a more likely weather condition. The end point distance would be 0.2 miles. The only receptors in that area would be the commercial/industrial areas. No environmental receptors would be in that area.\n   The facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applic"

In addition, the facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation requiring a Process Safety Management system. Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management of change process, and a prestart-up safety review program. In addition,we have implimented a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions. If an incident does occur, it is thoughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all of the affected personnel. We believe our prevention program is the key to minimizing the risk to our emplyees, the public, and the environment.\n   In the past five years there has not been an accident involving ammonia that resulted in a death,injury, or significant property damage; nor any offsite deaths, injuries, or environmental damage.\n   In the event of an ammonia emergency, we will implement our emergency response plan. If necessary, we will also notify the Orange City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency response plan has been coordinated with the fire department and they have been involved with our hazmat training responders class. They have been involved with training drills and are familiar with the facility layout also."
