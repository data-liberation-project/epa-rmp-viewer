      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\nThe West Tulsa Facility is a butane storage and blending facility. The facility is located in Tulsa, OK. The regulated substance at this facility is butane. The equipment which handles butane includes a pressure vessel and associated piping. The pressure vessel and associated piping may contain a maximum of 245,971 lbs of butane.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nThe West Tulsa Terminal has a strong commitment to worker and public safety, along with resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and contractors in design, installation, operations,and maintenance procedures. These assets began operating under the name Magellan Pipeline Company, L.L.C. on September 1, 2003.  Magellan Pipeline Company L.L.C. was subsequently changed to Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P. on September 9, 2004.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\nAs discussed in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the EPA has defined the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. At West Tulsa, the regulated substance is butane which is a flammable substance. This WCS assumes the entire quantity contained in the largest vessel or section of piping within the butane system releases to the atmosphere, forms a\nvapor cloud, and is subsequently detonated. One (1) pound per square inch overpressure is used as the endpoint as this is the threshold for potentially serious injuries to people from flying glass, falling debris, and other explosion effects.  \nAt West Tulsa the largest quantity of the covered flammable substance, butane, is the 50,000 gallon vessel.  The WCS assumes this vessel in its entirety is released "

      "SummaryText": "catastrophically to the atmosphere and the vapor cloud formed is ignited and then at some distance from the center of the explosion reaches an endpoint of one (1) PSI overpressure. A total of 206,937 lbs is the maximum amount of butane that is stored in the vessel taking into account an administrative control limiting the maximum level of butane in the tank to 85%. Using RMP*Comp to\ncalculate the distance to endpoint, a 0.5 mile radius is estimated to be impacted if the worst case type of release occurred at West Tulsa.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO DESPRICTION\nFor the butane storage facility, the alternative case scenario is a release from a pump seal on the blending pump. The seal fails and equates to approximately a 1A? hole. This pump is downstream of the storage vessel and once the seal leak occurs, the pump is automatically shut down by the temperature transmitter located on the pump seal area within 30 seconds. Once the pump is shut down, the driving force is the liquid height of butane stored within the vessel at the time. For this scenario, the assumption is that the season is summer when the tanks are typically full and the liquid has expanded due to warmer weather, so the full height of the tank is used to estimate the release rate. The leak is detected by the hazardous gas detectors at the location and then the nearest technician arrives within 25 minutes. The technician evaluates the situation and puts on the proper PPE and isolates the pump by closing the suction and discharge valves after another 15 minutes have passed resulting in a total release time of 40 minutes.  In this scenario, the release rate is 938 lbs per min for 40 minutes for a total release volume of 37,520 lbs.  Using RMP*Comp to calculate the distance to endpoint, a 0.1 mile radius is estimated to be impacted if this  alternative case release occurred at West Tulsa.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM:\nThe regulated butane storage/blending process in the facili"

      "SummaryText": "ty is compliant with the thirteen (13)elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The process controls listed in Section 7.4e were chosen based on whether or not they were used as safeguards in the last PHA for this facility. There may be other process controls in this facility that were not identified as safeguards in the last PHA. The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\". The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the regulated equipment.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nThere has been one accidental release from the butane process at the West Tulsa Facility within the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. Within the past five years the butane process has had no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule. In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the butane process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, emergency responders should not enter the area unless directed through the unified or incident command process.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nNo changes are currently planned to the butane process. As opportunities for improvement associated with this process arises at the West Tulsa Terminal, they will be evaluated by Magellan Pipeline Company, L.P.\n"
