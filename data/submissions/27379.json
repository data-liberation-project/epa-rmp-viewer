IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, JOHNSON COUNT LEPC, AND OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF THE RELEASE  TO THE PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRNOMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n    THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY OF THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF FERTILIZER FOR SALE TO FARMERS. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION AS A NUTRIENT FOR CROP PRODUCTION. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 218,000 POUNDS IN THE STORAGE TANKS AND NURSE TANKS.\n\n3. WORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n    A. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS GAS OVER A PERIOD OF 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 79,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK  AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS. THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION AT 200 PARTS PER MILLION) IS 1.89 MILES.\n\n       B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, A 3 INCH TRANSFER HOSE IS USED AS AN ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO FOLLOWED BY THE RELEASE OF AMMONIA FOR 2 MINUTES BEFORE AND AUTOMATIC EXCESS FLOW VALVE INTERVENES OR REMOTE MANUAL SHUT OFF IS CLOSED AND STOPS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WOULD BE 11,908 POUNDS. THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION OF 200 ppm) IS .83 MILES. (THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT, WOULD BE A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 1 INCH TRANSFER HOSE SCENARIO FOLLOWED BY RELEASE OF AMMONIA FOR 2 MINUTES BEFORE AN AUTOMATIC EXCESS FLOW SHUT DOWN VALVE INTERVENES OR REMOTE MANUAL SHUT OFF IS CLOSED AND STOPS THE FLOW OF AMMONIA. THE MAXIMUM QUANITY RELEASED WITH THIS SCENARIO WOULD BE 2,901 POUNDS, THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION AT 200ppm) IS"

WE REQUIRE THAT EACH EMPLOYEE THAT LOADS AMMONIA BE TRAINED EVERY THREE YEARS AT A STATE SPONSERED TRAINING SCHOOL AND YEARLY TRAINED IN OPERATING AND SAFETY PROCEDURES AT A GIVEN AMMONIA PLANT. ALL EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO INSPECT THE AMMONIA PLANT BEFORE FILLING PROCEDURES AND BEFORE USE DO A VISUAL INSPECTION OF ALL HOSES AND VALVES TO MAKE SURE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FAILURE OF EQUIPMENT SINCE THE LAST TIME IT  WAS USED.  EMPLOYEES ARE REMINDED TO FOLLOW START UP PROCEDURES BEFORE FILLING AND DURING FILLING OF  NURSE TANKS. \n\n    5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIES OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE FACILITY, NOR TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAS THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES RESULITING IN OFF SITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. \n\n    6.
