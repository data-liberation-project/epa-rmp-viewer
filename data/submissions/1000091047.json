WinCo's Boise Distribution Center supplies grocery products to Stores located in the States of Utah, Idaho, Montana and Washington. WinCo's Boise Distribution Center employs\n\napproximately 250 people and utilizes anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of perishable grocery products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA Regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nPursuant to RMP Regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) Regulations, WinCo has developed a comprehensive RMP/PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals (anhydrous ammonia) located on\n\nsite. The facility completed an initial process hazard analysis (PHA)and a 5 Year PHA Revalidation (2019)for the ammonia refrigeration system using the industry standard What-If Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). \n\n\n\nWinCo's implementation of the RMP/PSM Program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases. The Plan includes a regular preventative maintenance program (mechanical\n\nintegrity) for the ammonia system components, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of change (MOC) to the ammonia refrigeration system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work), and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nWinCo is committed to minimizing accidental releases from the refrigeration system at its Boise, ID distribution center. Facility Management is involved in the operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. WinCo's employees are involved in the development o"
