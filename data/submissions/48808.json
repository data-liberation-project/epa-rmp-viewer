      "SummaryText": "Brady and Desert Peak Power Plants\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nAt our power plants, we handle pentane which is considered a hazardous flammables by the US EPA. The same properties that make these regulated substances valuable as a working fluid for the power plants also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure,  to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our facility staff personnel, and to reduce the threat to our community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these regulated substances combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of these facilities combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel. \n\nSince our operators do not respond to large chemical releases, we have implemented an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for handling small releases of hazardous chemicals as required by OSHA under 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\n2.  Facility and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe purpose of our operation is to generate electricity by utilizing the geothermal resource as a source of energy. Our facility is located off the Nightingale exit on Interstate 80 east of Fernley Nevada.  There are two facilities know as Brady, and Desert Peak 2.  Brady consists 3 steam powered turbines and one O.E.C (Ormat Energy Converter) each steam turbine puts out approximately 9 MW maximum (gross), and the O.E.C. puts out approximately 7 MW gross.  Desert Peak 2 consists of one water cooled O.E.C. rated at approximately 7.7 MW (gross), and one air cooled O.E.C. rated at approximately 14 M.W.    \n\n- Geothermal Energy and Power Plants\nGeothermal energy is renewable heat energy from the earth?s core. Geothermal reservoirs of hot water or steam are tapped with wells and their heat is converted to electr"

      "SummaryText": "icity. At the Brady and Desert Peak 2 plants, geothermal fluid is pumped 300?-315? F is pumped from the ground.  The geothermal fluid is then separated into steam and brine.  At the Brady facility, the steam is sent through the three steam turbines to create power, and the brine is sent through the OEC.  At the Desert Peak 2 facility, both steam and brine are sent through the O.E.C.s .  At both facilities, the condensed is steam mixed into the cooled brine, and then pumped back into the ground at one of our injection wells.\n\nThe Brady facility utilizes 68,750 pounds of pentane in a closed loop to create power.\n\nThe Desert Peak 2 facility uses 217,190 pounds of pentane in a closed loop to create electricity.\n\n-O.E.C. Overview\nThe O.E.C. or Ormat Energy Converter is the most common device that Ormat uses to create electricity in geothermal power plants.  An O.E.C. used a closed loop pentane cycle heated by another fluid, in this case steam or brine.  Because pentane boils at a lower temperature than steam, this allows for the possibility of an air cooled condenser. Air cooling means that less of the resource will be lost into the air due to evaporation.  This also allows for power to be created whenever there is a change in temperature more than 150 degrees Fahrenheit can be found. \n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program focuses primarily upon the proper training and actions of our operators as outlined by OSHA's  Process Safety Management (PSM), EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP), and NDEP's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP). The Training Program, Standard Operating Procedures, Incident Investigation Program, and Management of Change Program ensure that the operator is aware of all potential hazards as well as the measures to mitigate them. \n\nThe Preventive Maintenance and Mechanical Integrity Program is essential in maintaining the integrity of the equipment.

      "SummaryText": " operation of equipment also play a critical role in our prevention program.\n\nIn addition the Accidental Release Prevention Program relies upon safeguards inherent to the design of the power plant. Such safeguards include gas sensors and alarms, relief valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, vents, and check valves. \n\nIn the event of a fire, the plants are equipped with a sprinkler system, deluge system, fire monitors and hydrants.\n\n4.  Five Year Incident History:\n\nWe have had no accidental isobutane, isopentane or pentane releases in the last five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n5.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur plants have been operating safely for many years, we will continue to ensure extensive training is provided to are operators as they are essential to plant safety. \n\nIn addition we will evaluate any new mitigation or control technology that may improve safety at the Steamboat Facilities."
