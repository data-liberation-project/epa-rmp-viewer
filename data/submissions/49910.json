As part of this commitment, the Company in Lewiston, Idaho, has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at it?s? facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the CCI Operation and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Ammunition Accessories Inc.?s CCI Operation.  The risk management plan is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the CCI Operation.  The risk management plan ?Supplement #1? provides specific details and addresses the requirements of the rule.\n\nThe risk management program at the CCI Operation consists of the following elements:\n?a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n?a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes)\n?Coordination Agreements with the local response agencies and a formal notification procedure to activate the response (as a Non-Responding Facility). \n\nAlthough the risk management program at the CCI Operation helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program.

Response activities have also been discussed with the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Office of Emergency Management.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the Ammunition Accessories Inc. CCI Operation has established a management system headed by the Environmental/Engineering Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\nFacility Information and Regulated Substances\nThe Ammunition Accessories Inc., Lewiston Operation consists of three production locations - CCI, Speer, and Southport.  Only the CCI operation uses chemicals in quantities included within RMP regulations.  Approximately 574 full-time workers work at the CCI operation.  The location produces small arms ammunition for the shooting sport industry, police and military markets.  \n\nThe chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment plant to de-toxify cyanide from the facility?s copper plating operation.  The process is subject to OSHA?s PSM standard under Federal OSHA programs and is subject to Program 3.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nThe facility has formalized the prevention program for connecting the chlorine cylinders and maintaining related equipment.

The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the department manager and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n3.  Operating Procedures.  Ammunition Accessories Inc.  engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Employees develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including changing of cylinders , normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\n4.  Training.  Ammunition Accessories Inc. trains workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process,  (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.
