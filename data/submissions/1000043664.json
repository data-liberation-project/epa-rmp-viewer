This group monitors the on-site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local Depot Manager are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe construction of the Costco Wholesale facility was completed in early 1998.  An expansion of the refrigeration system and the facility was completed in December 2002 with additional minor modifications in 2006.  Another expansion of the refrigeration system and the facility was completed in May 2011.  The facility is located at 11600 Riverside Drive (Bldg.

The immediate area is primarily light industrial.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for a cross dock warehouse and freezer storage.  Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from 9 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 150-180 psig on the high side.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is used to maintain appropriate temperatures for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.  Ammonia leak detectors are located in the machine room and in the cold storage warehouse that alert facility personnel in case of an ammonia leak.  The detection system can also mitigate a catastrophic release by shutting down the system.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia on site is 32,522 pounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Managem"

Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia leak detectors in the machine room and the cold storage warehouse, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion (neutralization) tank.\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the Depot system in Costco Wholesale.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases during the past 5 years (June 2009 to June 2014).  No injuries have occurred at the facility (or off-site) due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at t"

Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local fire department as well as the Riverside County Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.  The local refrigeration service contractors are also on-call and can respond for assistance during ammonia emergencies.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Depot Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.  Costco Wholesale maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility including the Facilities Manager and the Assistant Depot Managers.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.  In addition to the 5 Year PHA Revalidation Study (December 2012), a Process Hazard Analysis Addendum was completed in May 2011 for new equipment that was added to the existing system as part of the 2011 Expansion project.  A Three-Year Compliance Audit was conducted in July 2011.  These studies generated recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  These "
