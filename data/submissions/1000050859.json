Responsible environmental stewardship is our goal and we are engaged in developing ways to reduce our environmental footprint. We do this by producing products in accordance with not just the letter of local and national environmental laws, but also the spirit. We also take a leadership role in creating products that actually reduce usage of our collective national energy resources.\n\n\n\nHere are some of the environmentally-friendly methods we have incorporated in our fabrication centers.\n\n\n\nEnergy-Efficient Glass Products\n\nPlant Emission Control\n\nMaterials Recycling\n\nWe believe that simple changes combined with energy-efficient technologies will make a big difference in our ecological future.\n\n\n\nWe have submitted the RMP in conjunction with our environmental philosophy, not because we routinely have over the threshold amounts onsite; but because it is possible that we may have over the threshold amounts of sulfur dioxide on site. We have had a Process Safety Management Program in place for a number of years, which addresses our accident release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases in the last 10 years.\n\n"
