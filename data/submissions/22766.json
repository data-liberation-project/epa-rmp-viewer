If an emergency were to occur, signs are posted that refer to Randy Whalen who is employed by West Bend Elevator and is also the Dickens Fire Dept Chief.  Randy will then decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.    This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is 137,700 pounds.  This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 13,7700 pounds per minute and the duration of the release would be approximately 10 minutes.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.  Dickens has 2 bullet tanks and 27 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.   There are an estimated 574 people within this radius.  Residences, commercial businesses, offices, and recreation areas are also located in this area.  It is this facility's intention to comply with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.   West Bend Elevator holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed and is maintained with state laws and regulations in mind.    We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency involving our NH3 system, it is our policy to notify the Dickens Fire Dept and request th"
