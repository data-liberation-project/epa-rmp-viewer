Resources used in the process was International Institute of Ammonia \nRefrigeration Guidelines, RMP Pro 98 Software by Dyadem\nand Cold Storage Technologies.\n \n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at NADCO are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This \ncommitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that \ncovers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee \ntraining associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate \ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facilitys primary activities encompass Packing and storage of grapes and non-citrus tree \nfruit.  We have 1 Federal and State regulated substance present at our facility above threshold \nquantities.  Two additional regulated substances below State and Federal thressholds not \nincluded are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfuric Acid. Regulated substance included is Ammonia \n(anhydrous) used for Refrigeration.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release \nScenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to \nlimit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's \nRMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following \nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class \ninvolves a catastrophic release from Ammonia Refrigeration.  In this scenario 17988.8 lb. of \nAmmonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep \npool from which evaporat"

At Class F atmospheric \nstability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.52 miles is obtained corresponding \nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a vapor release from the \nHigh Pressure Receiver Safety Relief Valve.  The scenario involves the release of 4500.00 lb. \nThe leak would stopped in 60 minutes by manual activation of the standby SRV.  Under neutral \nweather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia \n(anhydrous) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\nSpecific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and California Accidental Release \nPrevention Program.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 \nStandard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release \nprevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nNADCO maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, \noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes \nare identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \nWhat If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with \nexpertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 \nyears.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most \nrecent PHA/update was performed on 06/12/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nF"

These procedures address various modes of operation \nsuch as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is \nregularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nNADCO has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are \noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  \nRefresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nNADCO carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure \nproper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; \npressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown \nsystems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel \nwith previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered \nspecialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance \nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at NADCO to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, \nequipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was \nperformed on 05/14/1999.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee \nwhose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of \nand offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes \nare conducted as a regular practice at NADCO.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and \nmaintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nNADCO conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the \nRMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on \n05/14/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions \nrequired as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nNADCO promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a \ncatastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the \nsituation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from \nreoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nNADCO truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  \nCompany employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident \nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to \nall information created as part of the facilitys implementation of the RMP rule, including \ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction \nactivities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the \ncontractor is carried out.  NADCO has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known \npotential hazards related the contractors work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed \nof all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated \nsubstance occur.\n\n\n5.

Emergency Response Plan\nNADCO carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous \nmaterials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and \nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the \npublic, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and \nserviced.
