              "Description": "Prevention Program\n\nAnheuser-Busch has implemented a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases.  Designed to reduce both the likelihood and severity of releases of ammonia, this program integrates technology, procedures and management practices.  This prevention program ensures that safe design principles and practices are followed for the brewery ammonia system and related projects by properly managing change to the system, as well as ensuring proper operation, maintenance and control of hazards.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe brewery has compiled information on the hazards of ammonia, the design basis for the refrigeration system and the specific equipment to help identify and understand the inherent hazards of ammonia and help in the safe operation of the system.  This information consists of:\n    - material safety data sheets (MSDSs)\n    - process flow diagram\n    - standard operating procedures (SOPs)\n    - SARA reports\n    - equipment drawings and specifications\n    - design and construction codes and standards compliance\n    - list of process safety relief valves that shows location, design basis and capacity\n    - manufacturer's equipment operating instructions\n\nThis process safety information was last reviewed during the audit which began onJuly 29, 1996.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nAn initial process hazard analysis was conducted at the brewery June 21-25, 1993, in the form of a Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP).  Attachment PHA-1 presents general information on the HAZOP study.  Attachment PHA-2 is taken from the brewery's Process Hazard Analysis database and shows equipment and operations, potential deviations and their causes, consequences and recommended actions that were part of the HAZOP analysis.  Attachment PHA-3 is an example of an expanded element within this database.\n\nPotential hazards associated with the ammonia system that were evaluated in detail as part of the analysis are listed below.\n    - abnormal operation\n    - accessibility\n    - body movement impaired\n    - clarity of instructions\n    - containment loss\n    - contamination\n    - corrosion\n    - drawings accuracy\n    - high/low/no/reverse flow\n    - high/low/no level\n    - high/low/no pressure\n    - high/low temperature\n    - instrumentation issues\n    - frequency/lack of information\n    - leakage\n    - equipment failure\n    - maintenance\n    - lack of/too much/wrong action\n    - relief valve discharges\n    - utilities failures\n    - vacuum\n    - visibility\n    - wrong component\n    - wrong sequence\n    - natural disasters (tornado, hurricane, earthquake)\n\nA system is in place to address the findings and recommendations resulting from the hazard analyses.  This system is driven by the risk matrix shown in Attachment PHA-4.  The status of the findings and action items are tracked in the previously mentioned database.  All recommendations resulting from the initial HAZOP analysis will be completed by May 31,1999.\n\nAttachment PHA-1\n    HAZOP Item 0.00 PHA Info: Title, Team Members, Bio's and Drawings\n    \nAttachment PHA-2\n    PHA-Merrimack NH3-Hazop\\By Item No.\n    \nAttachment PHA-3\n    HAZOP Item 1.10\n    \nAttachment PHA-4\n    Process Hazard Analysis - About Database\n    \n\n\nProcess Controls\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has the following process controls:\n    - relief valves that relieve vessel pressure at a specified limit and reclose at pressures below the limit.              Many of these valves relieve back into the system, thus preventing a release to atmosphere.\n    - burst disc indicators on all pressure relief valves that vent to atmosphere.  These burst disc indicators,             upon rupture, immediately signal the central control room\n    - check valves that prevent backflow in piping\n    - water scrubbers that absorb ammonia prior to venting to atmosphere during sytem pumpouts\n    - manual shutoff valves\n    - interlocks that prevent activation of equipment under certain conditions\n    - warning alarm and procedures to activate in the event of hazardous conditions\n    \n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nProper operation of the refrigeration system minimizes the likelihood of errors that could lead to an accidental release of ammonia.  Clearly written, detailed procedures, guidelines, rules, and practices ensure safe operation of the system during all phases of operation, including startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown and emergency operation, normal shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  Operating procedures provide all employees involved with the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system with the written information and precautions necessary to safely perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\n\nThe table of contents for the brewery's Ammonia Refrigeration System Standard Operating Procedures is presented in Attachment OP-1.  Attachment OP-2 shows an example of one of the facility's operating procedures.  These procedures were last reviewed in February, 1998.\n\nAttachment OP-1  Ammonia Refrigeration System Operating Procedures - Table of Contents\n            \n\n\nAttachment OP-2  Standard Operating Procedure 5.5 - Clark Reciprocating Compressor\n            \n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\nAll employees who operate, maintain and supervise the ammonia refrigeration system are trained and qualified to ensure proper, safe operation .  Attachment OT-1 shows an outline of the course material and competency testing.  Employees also receive on-the-job training.\n\nAttachment OT-1  Training Course Outline\n            \n         \n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION FOR ORIGINAL OR NEW EQUIPMENT, VALVES AND PIPING\n\nAssuring the mechanical integrity of a new system or new addition to an existing system is primarily an engineering responsibility. The following items relate to documented procedures used by Anheuser-Busch engineering to assure initial mechanical integrity\n\nEquipment Identification\nAll major pieces of equipment are initially assigned an equipment number.  This equipment number also identifies equipment on Anheuser-Busch engineering drawings and in design premise documents for the ammonia refrigeration system hereafter referred to in this document as \"the system\". \n\nEquipment Design Criteria\nA design premise document is prepared for each major piece of equipment that has been assigned an equipment number.  The design premise provides the original design details, governing codes and specifications for the equipment. A copy of the design premise is normally kept on file with plant engineering.\n\nEquipment Shop Drawings\nOn file with plant engineering are manufacturer's shop drawings, approved by Anheuser-Busch engineering and filed by equipment number.  These approved drawings offer certification that the equipment item was fabricated in accordance with design specifications.  Details pertinent to the mechanical integrity of the system such as equipment dimensions, mass/energy balance, materials of construction, code requirements, pressure/temperature limits, special construction and installation instructions, etc. are normally noted on these shop drawings.\n\nOther Related Equipment\nOther technical provisions, (TP-67) for electrical specifications, (TP-68) for instrumentation specifications, and (TP-59) for mechanical equipment installation, are also provided by engineering.  The technical provision documents are for use in purchasing, installing and testing piping systems to assure the mechanical integrity of the system.  Plant engineering applies the same technical provisions, where applicable, for any system modifications, maintenance and repairs implemented at the plant level.\n\n\nPROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION FOR MAINTENANCE OF MECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe program for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the system includes the following procedures:\n\n    - training of operators and maintenance personnel in awareness of system deviations that jeopardize the               mechanical integrity of the system\n    - daily inspections and testing of the system by the shift operator\n    - use of computerized programming to issue and document repetitive work orders for routine inspections, testing,           and maintenance of major equipment and piping\n    -  use of joint, periodic, inspections by plant engineering and insurance underwriter\n    - implementation of special guidelines for safety valve and control device inspection, testing, and replacement\n    - a policy on system spare parts and material\n\nOperator and Maintenance Personnel Training\nOne of the most important elements involved in maintenance of mechanical integrity is a knowledgeable, well-trained work force of system operators and maintenance personnel.  Towards that end, extensive training on basic refrigeration procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program was completed by the end of 1995.  Training sessions on specific ammonia system standard operating procedures via a teacher/tape/text/test program were completed by the end of 1996.\n\nInspection and Testing of Pressure Relief Valves\nPressure relief valves are set up on a computer documented identification, inspection and testing program. This program requires quarterly, annual, and five year inspections and testing.\n\n\nInspection and Testing of Monitoring Devices, Sensors, Alarms and Safety Interlocks\nThe following devices should be identified by an equipment number or listed on the repetitive work order for the major piece of equipment on which they are mounted.  If not covered by a special maintenance program, the following category of equipment or device is to be inspected annually as a minimum, or more frequently as recommended by the manufacturer or as determined by good engineering practices:\n\n    - cellar ammonia alarms\n    -suction traps\n        - level switches\n        - alarms\n        - liquid pumps\n    - compressor cutouts and alarms\n        - high discharge pressure\n        - high discharge temperature\n        - how suction. pressure\n        - low oil pressure\n        - high oil temperature\n        - cooling water flow/ temperature /level switch(s)\n    - evaporator accumulators\n        - liquid level control\n        - freeze protection devices\n        - high refrigerant level switch\n\nSpare Parts and Materials Policy\nSpare parts for system equipment and controls are to be original equipment manufacturer's parts. Any exception must meet industry standards and be approved by plant engineering.  Parts suppliers are to be documented on spare parts order forms.  The purchase and use of other materials such as valves and piping must meet the specifications in the latest corporate engineering technical provisions covering the material. (see previously explained, \"TP\" documentation).\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe brewery has in place a formal system to identify, assess,  authorize, and implement changes that may affect  the ammonia refrigeration system.  This system is described in Attachment MOC-1.  Prior to making a change in equipment or operation, an appropriate analysis must be completed and authorized.  The authorization form is shown in Attachment MOC-2.\n\nAttachment MOC-1  Mangement of Change System\n        \n\nAttachment MOC-2  Management of Change Form\n        \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review\n\nThis procedure ensures that a new system, or a significant modification to an existing system, is ready to operate safely.  The actions required are done before start-up (introduction of ammonia into the system for operational purposes).  They constitute a \"final check\" that the system is safe to place into service.\n\nThe Pre-Startup Safety Review follows Management of Change as the logical next step.  Management of Change asks, \"Is what you intend to do at least as safe as the rest of the system?\".  Pre-Startup Safety Review asks, \"Did you build it the way you intended to?\"\n\nSeveral of the actions of a Pre-Startup Safety Review are confirmation that other sections of the prevention plan have been accomplished.  In this way, Pre-Startup Safety Review is integrated into the whole of the management system.  \n\nAttacment PSR-1 details the Pre-Startup Safety Review process, and Attachment PSR-2 is a copy of the review form used to document the procedure.\n\nAttachment PSR-1  Pre-Startup Safety Review\n            \n\nAttachment PSR-2 Pre-Startup Review Form\n            \n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe audit program provides a means by which brewery and corporate management assures themselves that employees are properly meeting their responsibilities for prevention of accidental releases.  The audit program and protocols are designed to verify that the procedures and practices developed to comply with the PSM and RMP standards are being met.  The Anheuser-Busch audit protocol used is based on the audit format used bby the federal OSHA when performing Process Safety Management audits of general industry.  Any deficiencies identified during the audits are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nAudits are conducted every three years.  The most recent audit at the brewery was done in July and August, 1996 (began 7/29/96).\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nA crucial part of the prevention program is a thorough investigation of incidents to identify the chain of events and causes, so that corrective measures can be developed and implemented.\n\nAccordingly, the brewery has implemented a program that involves a comprehensive investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a potentially catastrophic release of ammonia.\n\nThis system has been established to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations.  Incident investigation teams utilize a database system to document and report on incidents and track followup activities.  All breweries have access to the database and review investigations from other sites and incorporate recommendations to prevent similar situations from occurring.  The Integrated Incident Reporting Database is shown in Attachment II-1.\n\nAttachment II-1  Integrated Incident Reporting Database\n                \n\n\nEmployee Participation Plan\n\nThis plan documents the involvement of the brewery workers in process safety issues.  Workers participate in process hazards analyses and are consulted on how the other elements of the Prevention Program are implemented.  Bargaining Unit employees are active members of each facility's Process Safety Management Committee.  They play an active role in implementing OSHA's PSM requirements and participate in all incident investigations.  Attachment EPP-1 provides specifics on the plan.\n\nAttachment EPP-1  Employee Participation Plan\n            \n\n\nHot Work Permit Procedures \n\nPrior to initiation of any operation involving flames, sparksor heat-producing equipment, a hot work permit is required.  The permit describes the hazards involved and the necessary precautions.  The permit is used to communicate the hazards and precautions to the workers performing the hot work.  The permit is shown in Attachment HW-1.\n\nAttachment HW-1  Hot Work Permit\n        \n\nContractors\n\nThe brewery has a program in place to ensure contractors are knowledgeable about ammonia refrigeration systems and their hazards, understand applicable codes and standards, and are able to work safely on and around the brewery's ammonia system.  Anheuser-Busch's general contract conditions and Contractor Safety Program requirements, which are part of the company's Commitment to Excellence program, require the following from contractors *:\n    - development and implementation of environmental, safety and health program\n    - hazard communication plan\n    - emergency response plan\n    - safety and accident reports\n    - employee safety training acknowledgement\n    - hot work permitting\n    - confined space entry permitting\n    - lockout/tagout program\n    - fire hazard checklist\n    - hazards of ammonia\n\n* This list is not all-inclusive.  The elements presented here are those relative to contractor risk management.\n\nA program to ensure contractor compliance with these requirements is in place at the brewery, i.e., Anheuser-Busch Corporate Engineering Construction Site Safety Audit.  The most recent audits were performed on June 14 & 15, 1999 (see attachments below).  The most recent review/revision of the contractor safety requirements and procedures was done in March, 1999 at the annual Contractors safety orientation.",

We have completed this report under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) risk management program (RMP) to communicate our efforts to achieve a safe workplace.  \n\nThe brewery uses ammonia as a key part of the cooling system that maintains beer at the proper temperature during certain stages of the brewing process.  Ammonia is one of the materials covered under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Risk Management Program regulations.  The brewery follows these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that it safely handles, uses, and stores ammonia and other potentially hazardous chemicals safely.  The brewery has had no releases of ammonia that resulted in injuries to people, harm to property, or damage to the environment since it opened in 1970.\n\nOur corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this brewery, employees, and the public.  This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. These programs enable the brewery to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of ammonia.  \n \nIt is Anheuser-Busch's policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment.  Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.  We do not allow production goals or financial objectives to over-ride safety and environmental concerns.  \n \nAlso, it is Anheuser-Busch's policy to lead by exa"

Anheuser-Busch employees whose actions in the performance of their duties may affect the environment and/or public health are trained sufficiently to permit them to comply strictly with our EHS policy. \n\nIn conducting our businesses, we continue to seek and implement cost effective methods to reduce the EHS impact of our operations.  We integrate EHS considerations into our business planning and decision-making processes, including product research and development, packaging, and new manufacturing methods.  Our continuous EHS improvement goals include pollution prevention and resource conservation.  We ask our contractors to adopt EHS standards, ethics, and policies similar to our own and we will give preference to suppliers that do so.\n \nWe encourage our employees, customers, and the public to share with us their EHS concerns.

As part of the brewing process, the beer is cooled to ensure its consistency, flavor and overall quality.  The beer packaged in kegs also is stored in a refrigerated area in our facility until it's shipped.
