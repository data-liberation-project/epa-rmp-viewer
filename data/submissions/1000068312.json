Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).  Crum is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119). Upon completion of modeling, Smith & Burgess found there were off-site receptors identified using EPA MARPLOT that could be impacted by the RMP scenarios. Therefore, Crum is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in US EPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by US EPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM.\n\n\n\na) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\nCrum employs one (1) full-time employee on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  Crum maintains a policy of safe condensate handling operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the extraction processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.  Crum has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a flammable material release. This Facility is submitting its first RMP to the US EPA. The Facility is non responsive.\n\n\n\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint encompasses public receptors.

      "SummaryText": "10 Census data. Therefore, Crum is classified as a Program 3 Facility. The processes at the plant are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The plant boundaries of the stationary source begin at pig receiver PR-100 at the plant gas inlet and at pig receiver PR-200 at the plant liquid inlet, and end at the pig launcher plant discharge just after the 12\" block valve tied to ESD-3300. This plant is designed to receive natural gas from a pipeline. The gas process begins with inlet separation to remove any pipeline liquids.  These \"Y-Grade\" liquids are combined with the other inlet liquids then stabilized as a condensate to remove any materials that are not atmospheric stable liquids. The condensate is sent to storage and can then be trucked off site. The remaining gas is then compressed to pipeline pressures and goes through a dehydration process to ensure most of the water is removed from the gas before being exported offsite.  The Crum Compressor Station was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded a defined threshold quantity. The listed flammable substances that are stored above threshold quantities at Crum are natural gas, unstabilized condensate, stabilized condensate, and natural gas liquids. The flammable components of these substances include\n\nmethane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and heavier alkanes. This Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the US EPA.\n\n\n\nc) The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nCrum employs one (1) full-time employee on-site who will ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.

The final action item from the PHA was completed before startup. Pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs) are conducted on a regular basis whenever changes are made to the process.
