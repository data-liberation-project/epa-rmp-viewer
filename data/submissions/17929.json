      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nAt the Martin Gas Sales, Inc. Rail Terminal facility, we handle propylene, which is considered a hazardous flammable gas by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propylene to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle propylene, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Gas Sales, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED \n\nThe facility stores propylene in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks.  The maximum amount of propylene stored at the facility is administratively limited to 80% of the facility capacity.  Propylene is delivered to the facility via rail cars and is transferred from the facility via pipeline.  The pipeline runs between the facility and a Diamond Shamrock gas processing facility.  The largest rail car typically unloaded at the facility has a maximum capacity of 34,000 gallons.  Access to the"

The maximum quantity of propylene that can be stored at this facility is 400,000 pounds. \n\nTHE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has incorporated a company policy that limits the maximum filling capacity of all propylene storage tanks to 80% at 60:F.  Therefore, our worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 140,000 pounds of propylene from a 34,000-gallon rail car.\n\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp, the EPA recommended software.  Based on 140,000 pounds of propylene released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.4-mile from the location of the rail car.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternate release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is a t"

The release would be limited to the amount of propylene in the transfer line, the loading rack manifold, and the iron piping between the rail car and the storage tanks.  Excess flow valves at the storage tank and rail car function to stop the flow of propylene out of the storage tank and rail car.  Therefore, the propylene released would be limited to 8,200 pounds of propylene, the amount in the transfer hose and iron piping.\n\nThe scenario assumes the entire quantity of propylene in the transfer hose and iron piping is released.  RMP*Comp estimates the distance endpoint for the release of 8,200 pounds of propylene as 0.1-mile.  The hazard endpoint extends offsite.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nMatin Gas Sales, Inc. complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules,  EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the propylene process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our propylene process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a \"What if\" checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the propylene process. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Rail Terminal facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks include; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Martin Gas Sales, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Martin Gas Sales, Inc.  The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nThe Rail "

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMartin Gas Sales, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of propylene.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n Employee Participation\n\nIt is our belief at Martin Gas Sales, Inc., that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Our company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  \n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Martin Gas Sales, Inc. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.
