We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our workers the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n?    A description of our facility and our uses of substances that are regulated by EPA?s RMP regulation.\n?    A summary of the results of our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n?    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n?    A five-year history of accidental releases for chemicals that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.\n?    An overview of our emergency response program.\n?    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accident chemical releases from occurring and therefore adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nVopak Terminal Deer Park is a for-hire liquid storage terminal.  Chemicals and refined petroleum products represent the majority of the bulk liquids stored, handled and transported in this facility.  Products are received into and transported from the facility via ship, barge, pipeline, tank car, and tank truck.  At this time the facility is storing four chemicals (Propylene Oxide, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, Isoprene and Piperylene [1,3 Pentadiene]) that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences under their Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Propylene Oxide and Vinyl Acetate Monomer are considered toxic substances but are not regulated as highly hazardous substances "

      "SummaryText": "under the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule; therefore, these two chemicals are regulated under Program Level 2 of the RMP rule.  Isoprene and Piperylene are considered highly hazardous substances under the OSHA PSM rule due to their flammability; therefore, these two chemicals are regulated under Program Level 3 of the RMP rule.  \n\n \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management system addresses each key feature of a successful prevention program including:\n\n?    Process safety information\n?    Process hazard analysis\n?    Operating procedures (ISO 9002)\n?    Training\n?    Mechanical integrity\n?    Management of change\n?    Pre-startup review\n?    Compliance audits\n?    Incident investigation\n?    Contractors\n?    Employee participation\n?    Hot work permits\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program are utilized to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business. With our specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of a regulated substance from a covered process in the past five years that have resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain various contingency plans, which address federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the communi"
