This is accomplished to a great extent by a well developed, up-to-date implemented Risk Management program. All USCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner. It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs. In the unlikely event of an accidental release it is USCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required. All USCS facilities will have an emergency response team to assist these agency(ies).\n\nUnited States Cold Storage, Omaha is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia as an refrigerant in a closed loop system. Anhydrous ammonia, most commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems. Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor.  Ammonia's odor is familiar to most people due to the fact that it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions. Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span of 7 days in the environment before it breaks down to its common elements nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\nTypical items stored within USCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in your supermarket or local restaurant. Temperatures range between -30 degrees to +45 degrees F. The refrigeration equipment and piping are located throughout the facility. The condensers and relating piping is on the machine room roof while the piping to and from the freezers, coolers, truck and rail docks located in the warehouse. The machine room contains most of the large refrigerating machinery and vessels.  In an unlikely event of a refrigerant"

It then may be treated and vented under controlled conditions.  The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors throughout to help lessen and leaks that might occur and to provide an early alert.\n\nUSCS believes that prevention is foremost. All of USCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel. Most of these people are members of the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) and all Chief Engineers are members of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). USCS has on staff at the corporate level an OSHA and EPA coordinator/trainer who is a certified OSHA Instructor. All facilities comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management without regard to the ammonia threshold quantity.  All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes. \n\nUSCS Omaha facility has been operating at this location for the past 36 years. Within that long history the facility has seen no releases from the refrigeration system(s) that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plan, 29 CFR 1910.38, 1910.119, Process Safety Management and OSHA's 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards. We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.\n\nThe third revalidation of the facility PHA recently performed produced no recommendations, however the second PHA performed in 2004 for this facility produced 1 recommendation and the first PHA produced 11 recommendations to improve safety at the Omaha facility. Such changes included training, installation of new mitigatio"
