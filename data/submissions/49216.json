      "SummaryText": "Hilmar Cheese Company is located in a rural area surrounded on all sides by farms.  Hwy 385 runs 0.2 miles from the process.  The facility address is 12000 Hwy 385 Dalhart, TX 79022.  The facilty has a program in place to meet OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, 1910.38, 1910.120.  The closest response agency is Dalhart Fire Department, but the closest Hazmat team is in Dumas, TX with a response time of approximately 1.5 hours.  This being the case, Hilmar has set up first response teams to act as rescuers and first response mitigation.  Site Incident Command, 40Hr Hazmat Technician, and the use of their equipment will be trained to all authorized responders.  Ammonia is expected to be installed the week of August 10th, and estimated inventory is 21,932#.  The ammonia system was built to meet ASHRAE 15 and IIAR-2 requirements and be safe.  The installing contractor used metallurgical lab certified welders and used only seemless pipe for further safety.  All equipment meets or exceeds requirements for ammonia systems and the latest technology was evaluated and utilized when deemed reliable, safer, and/or a reasonable expense.  Worst Case Scenario is based on the volume held in the CPR.  The toxic endpoint is calculated to 1.0 miles by using RMP Comp.  Through visual evaluation and Google Earth Pro, we feel there approximately 5 house with in the endpoint and the rest is farmland.  The alternate case is determine to have an endpoint of approximately 0.2 miles and barely cross the Highway and should affect no residences.  A revised version of this RMP will be provided by August 30th to include the employees reassigned to the process and the corrected amount from the Ammonia provider's packing slip."
