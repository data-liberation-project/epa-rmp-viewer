This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested an accident prevention such as employee training, safety in design, installation, operations and ongoing maintenance of the processes.\n\n\n\nDescription of stationary sources and regulated substances\n\nAES Deepwater is located in Pasadena Texas and operates a petroleum coke fired were for the generation of electricity. In 2004 Deepwater sent in a De-registration letter when ammonia was removed when the fertilizer process was shutdown. In 2007 ammonia was used as part of our scrubbing process. The ammonia is part of a scrubbing agent to be used in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) System to help reduce emissions. In 2011 Deepwater sent a De-registration letter when the ammonia was removed when the plant was off-line. In June 2012 ammonia will return to Deepwater prior to restarting the plant.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program / chemical specific prevention\n\nAES Deepwater provides for and encourages all of its employees to anticipate and all facets of the risk management plan as well as process safety management.  Deepwater also provides a variety of technical procedures there used to maintain a safe operating environment and chemical handling.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nAmmonia was last used at AES Deepwater in 1999 and was removed from the site in 2004. In that time period no releases are events have occurred in the use of ammonia. In 2006 through 2010 Ammonia was used as part of the SCR. In that time period no accident involving Ammonia system occurred. Every incident is investigated to determine root cause and to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program\n\nAES Deepwater works closely with the Pasadena LEPC to protect workers, public safety and the environment. Coordination includes periodic meetings with the LEPC. The LEPC is Deepw"
