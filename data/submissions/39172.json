Our mission includes a commitment to act as responsible neighbors in our communities. We will accomplish our mission by adhering with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility has developed an emergency response plan and has coordinated response activities with the Plainview Fire Department.\n\nThis facility produces beef products for market distribution and ultimately for public consumption. Anhydrous ammonia is the only risk management program regulated substance processed at the facility in excess of threshold quantities. Ammonia is used for mechanical refrigeration throughout the plant for all areas that require cooling. The refrigeration system includes receiving tanks, compressors, chillers, freezers and condensers, and associated piping, valves, and other equipment. \n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. In addition, the facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulation. Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management of change, and pre-startup safety reviews. In addition, we have implemented a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions. If an incident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees. We believe our prevention program is key to minimizing the risk to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nIn the past five years, there has been one ammonia release that is now included in the accident history that led to eight employee injuries on site. We have had no other accidents involving ammonia that resulted "

If necessary, we will also notify the Plainview Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency response plan has been coordinated with the fire department and they have inspected our facility.\n\nAlthough we do not have any active projects to improve the safety of our systems, it is our policy to continuously work towards better and safer systems."
