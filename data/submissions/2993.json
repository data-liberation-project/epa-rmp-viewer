This facility complies with OSHA 1910.111 standard requirements. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. If an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Milton Township Volunteer Fire Department and request that they respond. We are prepared to work with the Milton Township Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacitilty Description and Regulated Substances:\n  This facility is a branch location of the Deshler Farmers Elevator Co. We are a farmer-owned cooperative serving our member-customers by providing goods and services to assist them in producing agricultural products. One such product sold to producers is anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a crop production nutrient. One of the primary functions of this facility is storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. At this site is a 36,000 gallon storage tank with a capacity of 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and associated delivery and application equipment.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\n  Our worst-case scenario is a total failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank, thus releasing the total contents within a ten minute span. The maximum amount released would be 150,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) in this situation is 1.19 miles. Private dwellings with an estimated population of 400 are within the impact zone endpoint.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a break in a transfer hose from the storage tank to a delivery wagon. In this scenario, 4,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia would be released, resulting in an impact zone endpoint distance of .43 miles, af"

(ANSI) and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anydrous Ammonia\". Employees are given proper training and the facility is on a regular inspection schedule.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n  We have not had an accident involving the release of anhydrous ammonia that has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n  This facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.138.  We have provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency and employee training is in place. In the event an emergency does occur, it is our policy to notify the Milton Township Volunteer Fire Deparment and request that they respond. We have discussed this with the fire department and a member of the fire department has inspected this facility.\n\nPlanned Safety Changes:\n  Safety improvement is an on-going process. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the preservation of safe conditions. There are no specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
