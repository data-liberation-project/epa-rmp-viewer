In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. \n\nTerra's Corporate Mission states \"To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public\". In order to fulfill this mission, Terra provides a corporate EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures. EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor facility compliance with the safety standards of the company. \n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist survey forms that are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary to ensure all applicable federal state and local regulations are covered. The EHS group conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the safe handling and storage of aqua ammonia. The field supervisors require a timely written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\n Each location has a 'site safety coor"

Aqua Ammonia is received by truck, handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We mix aqua ammonia solution with other fertilizers to make various grades of liquid fertilizer and/or micro nutrients. The liquid fertilizer or micro nutrients are plant foods applied to the soil for growing agricultural crops.  \n\nAqua ammonia is stored on site in three 25,000 gallon stationary storage tank(s), within concrete secondary  containment. 570,000 pounds of 24% aqua ammonia, representing 140,000 pounds of ammonia, is the maximum storage capacity of the stationary storage tanks. The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 190,000 pounds of 24% aqua ammonia, representing  approximately 46,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\nThe worst case scenario.\n\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 25,000 gallon storage tank to the secondary containment dike released as a liquid over 74.5 minutes with ammonia being released as a vapor. The maximum quantity released would be 46,000 pounds of ammonia.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. \n\nAlternative Release scenario\n\nThe most common alternative release scenario(s) from our facility would not reach an end-point off-site.

This release scenario (distance to point of dispersion to 200 PPM) would have off site impact. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThe aqua ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the Office of Indiana State Chemist - Indiana Commercial fertlizer law, API 650 and API 653 tank design and inspection specifications, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur aqua ammonia system is protected from major releases by relief valves, manual shutoffs and concrete secondary containment. All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur aqua ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Valves, hoses, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in accordance with Terra policies and industry standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and on the job training. \n\nFive-year accident history.\n\n There has been no accidents involving aqua ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage including evacuations on or off-site.\n\nThe emergency response program.\n\n In the event of an emergency involving our aqua ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.

The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. \n\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site.
