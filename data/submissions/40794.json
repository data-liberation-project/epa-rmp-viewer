              "Description": "LSB is a beef processing/cold storage facility.  This facility falls under the NAICS code 31161(animal processing from carcass).  Our safety information was last reviewed and updated August 16, 2004 (Safety Meeting Conducted Every Month).  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association, American National Standards Institute, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards.  These standards, and all applicable OSHA standards have been implemented here through written manuals by Environmental Services Group, Inc.  The most recent hazard review and update conducted for this facility was September 10, 2004, and corrections/recommendations should be completed by December 1, 2004.  The main hazard identified during this hazard analysis was the necessity of alarmed monitoring devices for identification/detection of releases in all areas where a release could occur. It was also recommended that the threshold limit for evacuation of this facility be lowered to 30 ppm, for anhydrous detection amounts, instead of the required 50 ppm set by the Federal Government.  To prevent/limit releases, this facility uses vents, relief valves, check valves, manual valve shutoffs, emergency air supply, emergency power backup, and grounding equipment. Operating and training procedures were last reviewed and revised on September 10, 2004.  The employees of LSB are trained in the classroom and by on-the-job training.  This training is completed with competency tests including demonstration, and observation.  The maintenance procedures are reviewed by operators on a regularly to ensure proper operation of the refrigeration system.  The last time they were reviewed and written out was in September 10, 2004.  LSB contracted Environmental Data Services, Inc., which triggered a review of our safety information, operating and maintenance procedures and training.  \n\nLSB is a Level 3 Prevention Program facility.  The following pages are the Prevention Program Elements to comply with the Risk Management Plan requirements under EPA regulations.",

      "SummaryText": "\nIn this beef processing facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification to White Buffalo, the San Angelo Fire Department, Butch Parks (Refrigeration Technician), and then notifying 911 System for call-out to affected responding agencies.  The San Angelo Fire Department and San Angelo Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Tom Green LEPC.   We have discussed this program with the Tom Green County LEPC, the Tom Green County Sheriff?s Office, the San Angelo Police Department, as well as the San Angelo Fire Department. A representative of Environmental Services Group, Inc. visited this plant May 13, 2004, which prompted a review of our written safety procedures, operating and maintenance procedures, our prevention program, and our emergency response  plans.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is processing and cooling beef by utilizing anhydrous ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "onia is stored in storage vessels located on the roof of the facility adjacent to the maintenance building on the East side of the property.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Compressor serves the Freezer, Cooler, Cooler Dock and the Lo Stage Compressor discharge loads.  The Lo Stage system serves the freezer.  Other associated systems are the thermosyphon oil cooling for the compressors, liquid feed make up, purge, and condensing system.  Note:  The system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 2150 E. 37th Street location is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 13,500 pounds.  This amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n \nThis meat packing/cold storage facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nThe cold storage system was originally constructed in 1980, and underwent additions in July 2004. This facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations applicable to this facility."
