      "SummaryText": "\nIn this beef processing facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that makes anhydrous ammonia valuable as a cold storage refrigerant chemical, also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposure, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-worker, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the community is the main goal of incorporating this risk management plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, and the training of our personnel.  \n\nOur emergency response program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Services Group, Inc.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification to White Buffalo, the San Angelo Fire Department, Butch Parks (Refrigeration Technician), and then notifying 911 System for call-out to affected responding agencies.  The San Angelo Fire Department and San Angelo Police Department will help to notify and evacuate any potentially affected neighbors by utilizing vehicles with PA mounted announcing systems.  The 911 System will also notify Tom Green LEPC.   We have discussed this program with the Tom Green County LEPC, the Tom Green County Sheriff?s Office, the San Angelo Police Department, as well as the San Angelo Fire Department. A representative of Environmental Services Group, Inc. visited this plant May 13, 2004, which prompted a review of our written safety procedures, operating and maintenance procedures, our prevention program, and our emergency response  plans.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is processing and cooling beef by utilizing anhydrous ammonia.

      "SummaryText": "onia is stored in storage vessels located on the roof of the facility adjacent to the maintenance building on the East side of the property.  Anhydrous ammonia is fed into the cooling system for cold storage.  The system is a two-stage pump re-circulated ammonia refrigeration system.  The Hi Stage Compressor serves the Freezer, Cooler, Cooler Dock and the Lo Stage Compressor discharge loads.  The Lo Stage system serves the freezer.  Other associated systems are the thermosyphon oil cooling for the compressors, liquid feed make up, purge, and condensing system.  Note:  The system flow diagram and control wiring diagrams should be used in conjunction with this description. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled at the 2150 E. 37th Street location is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 13,500 pounds.  This amount is an aggregate found in the storage vessel, as well as the entire cold storage system.\n \nThis meat packing/cold storage facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nThe cold storage system was originally constructed in 1980, and underwent additions in July 2004. This facility is striving to be in compliance with all applicable regulations applicable to this facility."
