Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, and maintenance demonstrates this commitment, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained refrigeration personnel are at hand to mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Findlay Fire Department and Hancock County HAZMAT team which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\".
