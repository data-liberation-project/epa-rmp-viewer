The ammonia refrigeration system contains approximately 87,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which is liquified under pressure.\n\nRich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to Associates, customers, and the community by having procedures to provide Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers.  Rich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluate the entire ammonia refrigeration system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia into locations that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.\n\nRich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility has developed this program in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119 and USEPA Title 40 CFR 68.  The program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).  In addition, Rich Products Corporation has generated the Rich Products Corporation Standards for Safety Performance which outlines the corporate policy for safety policies, safety procedures, and sample programs to be implemented at each Rich Products Corporation Facility.\n\nRich Products Corporation - Murfreesboro Facility has not had an accidental release over the last five years.\n\nThe emergency"
