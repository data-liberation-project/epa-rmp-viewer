Simplot Company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  J.R. Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The California Manufacturing Manager  has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia, Butane and 98% Nitric Acid safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  J.R. Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Butane or 98% Nitric Acid.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  An Emergency response plan procedures which enables trained personnel to respond  quickly to any accidental releases through the use of onsite employee Hazmat team.\n\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nJ.R. Simplot Company, Helm facility produces fertilizer and industrial chemicals.  There are 3 chemicals listed in 40 CFR 68.130, anhydrous ammonia, 98% nitric acid and butane that are processed, stored and handled in quantities exceeding threshold limits for this report.\n\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has three programs level 3 accident release prevention programs for anhydrous ammonia, butane and 98% Nitric Acid systems that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Manage"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere has not been any anhydrous ammonia, butane or 98% Nitric Acid-related incidents at the Helm Facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Facility has an onsite emergency response team in which every team member goes through initial 24 hour training followed by an annual 8 hour refresher training. The emegrency response team is trained to mitigate accidental releases or perform employee rescue within the means of the team or scenario. An emergency response trailer is located onsite with all emergency response equipment including SCBA and Level A Hazmat suits. All equipment is inspected periodically to ensue we are in compliance.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan also includes the following elements:\n\n\n\nA?    Fire Plan\n\nA?    Chemical  Leak Procedures\n\nA?    Evacuation Procedures\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nIn 2015 the Helm plant began a project to replace the existing (6) anhydrous ammonia storage tanks with (3) brand new ammonia storage bullets and associated piping. The new ammonia storage bullets also have water deluge \"cannons\" installed as part of overall safety improvement. The project is essentially complete and we will begin using the new system to deliver ammonia to the plant by the end of July 2016."
