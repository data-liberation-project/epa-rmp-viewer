Storing large quantities of this chemical can be a hazard if not handled properly. The Plant takes its safety obligations for storing and using hazardous chemicals as seriously as providing reliable wastewater treatment. This Executive Summary describes the steps taken to prevent an accidental chemical release, to ensure a safely operated plant, and how the Plant responds to an emergency. To date, the Plant has an excellent record in preventing accidental releases. Please feel free to contact Melody Tovar, Regulatory Programs Division Manager at (408) 730-7808 if you have questions. \n\n\n\nNote that the RMP is updated effective April 2013 to remove a previously listed process, the use of sulfur dioxide for dechlorination, from the RMP.  Dechlorination is now performed using sodium bisulfite, which is not a listed chemical for RMP/PSM programs.  Historical references to practices related to the safe management of sulfur dioxide have been removed from this RMP.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies \n\n\n\nThe Plant implements programs to comply with other accidental release prevention regulations, including California's OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program and the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP). In the Plant priorities developed by the management team, safety is listed at the number one priority and is not to be compromised for any other issue. All employees are to ensure that both employees and the community are safe at all times from any harm at the Plant. Compliance is the next priority for the Plant and should be planned for as we plan for safety, so that there is never a need to make a choice between the two. Compliance at the Plant means"

Written operator training programs for plant processes are in use for current and new operators. The Plant has a Safety Committee consisting of representatives from each section within the Plant that meets on a monthly basis to discuss safety issues and plant operations. Each Plant section has bi-weekly staff safety training meetings to provide training on pertinent operations and plans, with many of the training sessions related to chlorine process safety. \n\n\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information \n\n\n\nThe Plant is located at 1444 Borregas Avenue in Sunnyvale, near the southern tip of the San Francisco Bay. The Plant treats wastewater from the City of Sunnyvale, a small section of the City of Cupertino, and a portion of the Moffett Field Naval Air Station, located in Sunnyvale. The facility has a treatment capacity of 29.5 million gallons per day; average flow is currently 14-16 million gallons per day. Plant processes include preliminary treatment to remove large solids and grit, primary sedimentation to remove settleable solids, oxidation ponds as secondary treatment, biological treatment to nitrify ammonia, flocculation and coagulation for algae removal, filtration to remove suspended solids, disinfection for pathogen reduction, and dechlorination of treated water prior to discharge to render chlorine harmless in the final effluent. The Plant is a 24-hour per day/7-day per week operation. A Senior Operator is always on duty at the facility and will initiate established emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release or other emergency situation. \n\n\n\nThe facility currently stores chlorine, which is a regul"

The facility also produces methane gas in its digesters which is used to power influent pump engines and for the co-generation of electricity in two 800 kW generators that operate using a mixture of landfill gas, digester gas, and natural gas. Digester gas is stored in four digester domes and associated piping. Calculations maintained at the Plant demonstrate that the amount of digester gas stored does not exceed the RMP or CalARP threshold quantities. In addition, based on 2004 revisions to the RMP rule, methane that is used as fuel at a wastewater treatment plant is no longer covered in the RMP program by EPA. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\n\n\nChlorine is added to the wastewater prior to discharge to kill disease-causing organisms. The Plant's Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management Manual are based on the following key elements: \n\n\n\n-Management system, levels of responsibilities, and team member roles; \n\n-Comprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors; \n\n-A preventive maintenance and work order tracking program using MAXIMO computer programs; \n\n-A completed process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures with operations and maintenance staff participation and review; \n\n-Use of accurate and effective operating procedures with participation of operations and maintenance staff for review and revision, as required; \n\n-High level of training of operators and maintenance staff; and \n\n-Incident investigation, inspection, and auditing programs using qualified staff. \n\n\n\nProduct Delivery and Storage \n\n\n\nChlorine cylinders are delivered to the facility on flatbed trucks.

Once inside the Plant, all chlorine cylinders are immediately unloaded and placed inside the storage building where they are safety-secured. The containers are never left outside or unattended. After the cylinders are secured in the storage buildings, an intruder alarm system is activated. The intruder alarm system is active when Plant personnel are not working in the storage buildings. \n\n\n\nProcess and Chemical Safety Information \n\n\n\nComprehensive chemical data have been assembled to include regulatory reporting and action thresholds, health hazards, and chemical exposure limitations, as well as detailed physical properties of each regulated substance. This information was compiled from numerous sources prior to conducting the Process Hazard Analysis. It includes MSDS sheets, chlorine background information, and chlorine reaction chemistry. \n\n\n\nEquipment safety information has been compiled on the chlorine process, including maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower temperatures, safe upper and lower pressures, and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes. The Plant also has procedures in place to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\n\n\nPlant staff, engineering, and administrative staff conducted an initial, detailed PHAs for the chlorine disinfection system in December 1993. A revalidation of the PHAs was conducted in December 1999 by a team of maintenance, operations, engineering, and administrative staff using the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) method and \"What If\" methods as per acceptable approach guidance from EPA. Another revalidation using the HAZOP and \"What if\" methodologies was completed in 2003 and 2006-2007 using a similar team make-up.

The two remaining items pertaining to the chlorine disinfection system (a change to an inspection and cleaning frequency and the development of an SOP to formalize an existing practice) were completed in June 2012. Most of the items related to completing and refining the upgrades previously made to the chlorinators. The Plant continues to plan for the impending decommissioning of the chlorine system as described further in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\n\n\nThe Plant maintains current, accurate, written operating procedures that include clear instruction for the operation of the chlorine process. Operating procedures are incorporated into operation and maintenance training programs. Step-by-step written operating instructions were developed for the chlorine system that include procedures for process start up, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operations. The Plant Safety Committee and Senior Operations Staff review and update procedures, as needed.

The team evaluates whether the RMP/PSM Plan and its implementation satisfy the requirements of the RMP/CalARP, and PSM, and if the plan is sufficient to ensure safe operation of the chlorine process. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations reviewed and resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the RMP/PSM Plan are adopted. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation \n\n\n\nIn addition to its routine industrial accident investigation program, the Plant investigates all incidents involving chlorine that caused or could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment, so that similar accidents can be prevented. The Plant trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation. \n\n\n\nAn investigation team is assembled to investigate covered process incidents.
