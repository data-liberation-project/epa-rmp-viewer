      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nOwens Corning Insulating Systems, LLC ? Rockford, IL  61109\n\nIntroduction\n\nOwens Corning Insulating Systems, LLC (OCIS) owns and operates a polystyrene foam insulation manufacturing facility in Rockford, Illinois (Rockford Facility).  The Rockford Facility consists of two polystyrene foam board extrusion lines with associated equipment; finishing, grinding, and polystyrene reclaim equipment.  The existing blowing agent used at the facility is being replaced with a new blowing agent that contains an RMP-listed chemical that will be on-site above the threshold storage quantity. As such, the Rockford Facility is newly subject to RMP regulations in 40 CFR 68 and is submitting this Risk Management Plan as required. \n\nPlant Description\n\nThe Rockford Facility is located at 2710 Laude in Rockford Township, Winnebago County, Illinois.  \n\nBlowing Agent System/Manufacturing Process Description\n\nThe blowing agent storage tanks are located outside the facility and will be filled from a tanker truck or iso-totes at a dedicated outdoor unloading station.  The blowing agent is piped from the outside storage tanks, inside to the blowing agent stand and then to the two polystyrene foam board extruding systems.  The manufacturing process includes extruding molten polystyrene plastic which has been injected with the blowing agent and other additives.  The extruded material expands as the blowing agent vaporizes under a partial vacuum in a vacuum chamber and  produces a basic board stock with a closed cell structure.  The board stock is then cooled to a level suitable for further fabrication, packaging and storage.\n\nProcess Hazard Assessment (PHA)\n\nProcess hazard assessments were performed on the covered process using a 'HAZOP' type analysis.  The HAZOP analysis results in a listing of undesirable events with their consequences, safeguards, and recommendations for risk reduction\n\nPrevention System\n\nThe Rockford Facility has in place a Process Safety Management system.

      "SummaryText": " Procedures are in place for operation, maintenance and inspection of the covered, blowing agent system. There are Operation and Maintenance documents for each major piece of equipment, and a formal training process for employees and any contractors before being allowed to work on the systems.\n\nThe blowing agent system is visually inspected on a periodic basis.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for unloading, startup, shutdown, normal operation and emergency operation of the blowing agent storage systems will be in place when operation begins. Personnel are trained on safety concerns and general operation procedures as well as emergency procedures. \n\nSeveral process controls are in use for the blowing agent system, including vents, relief valves, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, rupture disks, dikes and excess flow devices.  Similarly, several mitigation systems inside the facility such as double containment hoses, ventilation, and fire walls are in use.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Rockford Facility has its own Emergency Response Plan that includes specific actions to be taken in response to accidental releases, procedures for informing the public and local agencies, and information on emergency health care.\n  \nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Rockford Facility has had no blowing agent releases in the past five years which need to be reported in the five year accident history."
