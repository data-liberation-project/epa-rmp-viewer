Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe LOUISIANA REFINING COMPLEX \u00bf NORCO REFINERY primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and  thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.

This is to ensure continued safe and reliable unit operation without adverse impact to people, environment, unit operability, unit maintainability, or product quality.\n\nOperations Procedures\nThis work process is intended to assist in the development and implementation of written procedures and policies for all process units and supporting systems.\n\nGoals And Measurements\nCollect leading and lagging process safety metrics to establish a baseline for all refineries.\n\nAudits and Assessments\nFormulate and implement consistent and effective practices and guidance for Process Safety Audits and Assessments to assure compliance and continuous improvement in Process Safety.  \n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\nThe primary purpose of a PHA is to identify, evaluate and control process safety events and hazards that could result in catastrophic releases of toxic, flammable or explosi"
