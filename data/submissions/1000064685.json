      "SummaryText": "Apache Corporation owns and operates the Redwood Central Processing Facility, a natural gas processing plant, in Reeves County, Texas. The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and refrigeration. Apache Corporation has a standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\n\n\nThe Redwood Central Processing Facility operates a variety of processes to produce natural gas liquids. These substances can contain the following regulated chemicals:\n\nMethane\n\nEthane\n\nPropane\n\nButane\n\niso-butane\n\nPentane\n\nIso-Pentane\n\n\n\nThe major objective of Apache's Process Safety Management (PSM) programs is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals that could expose employees or cause harm to the environment. The program requires a systematic approach to evaluating each of Apache's operated facilities that meet the threshold quantities. Using this management program, the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, nonroutine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process are all considered in the evaluation. The PSM describes Apache's management policies and procedures to support process safety management during operations. This document specifies or references the resources managed\n\nunder the PSM program to:\n\nMonitor and control the environmental and safety policy\n\nOpera"

The assets are oil and gas processing facilities that have potential for unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals. Additionally, Apache has developed and instituted numerous region and company specific health, safety, and environmental policies, procedures and training programs to further protect workers and the environment. The procedures are provided to the field workers and training is conducted periodically, which includes, site specific, on-the-job, orientation and awareness based courses. Management and employees are held accountable to complying with the procedures and work rules. Leadership, from the top down, within the organization is committed to protecting the environment and sending workers home safely at the end of the day.\n\n\n\nThe Redwood Central Processing Facility is a new site, there have been zero RMP-regulated substance releases in the last five years."
