The facility consists of one 30,000 gallon tank and is serviced by transport truck delivery. \n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pullaway leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
