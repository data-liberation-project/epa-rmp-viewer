However, the operation requiring anhydrous ammonia was shut down several years ago and the Facility deregistered as a RMP source as the storage of on-site ammonia was no longer required.  While in operation, the only accident that occurred in the last 5 years was in March 2019.  The March 2019 accident is detailed in Appendix C and did not qualify as a reportable incident in the context of RMP.\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, plant personnel will notify the Emmetsburg Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation. We have provided the fire department with our Emergency Response Plan. \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY: The plant and anhydrous ammonia system are new construction. The Facility has an ongoing and continuing process to audit, update and review our manufacturing process for safety considerations. Based upon this review, the Facility will further improve the safety systems if improvements are determined to be required."

The primary focus is to prevent accidental releases before they occur, while providing systems that minimize any release that does occur and contain it in as small as area as possible. \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: It is the Facility's policy to operate the plant in a manner that protects its employees, the public, and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. The Facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases. \nFACILITY DESCRIPTION: The Facility produces an advanced fuel ethanol from agricultural residue, corn cobs and stover. The Facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia in the pre-processing step where it is consumed. The Facility has an anhydrous ammonia storage tank and associated process lines that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency\u0092s (EPA\u0092s) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u0092s (OSHA\u0092s) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  EPA\u0092s CAPP requires a Hazard Assessment and the development of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the anhydrous ammonia system. \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: The Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule. As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment. Numerous safeguards are in place and include Operational Procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industry practices.
