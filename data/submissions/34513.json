This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. (Tessenderlo Kerley) policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\tDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n\tSUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tessenderlo Kerley Facility is located in south central Benton County southwest of Finley, Washington.  The plant occupies approximately five acres at the junction of Chemical Drive and the Northern Railroad tracks on the west bank of the Columbia River.\n\nThe Facility produces and distributes agricultural and industrial chemicals (specifically mining and pulp and paper) for the northwest market.  Production at the Facility consists of the manufacture of fertilizers, pesticides, chemicals used for metal extraction in the mining industry, and chemicals used in the kraft paper industry.  \n\nProducts at the Facility include the manufacture or storage of several agricultural products: two ammonium polysulfide (APS) products, ammonium thiosulfate (ATS), and potassium thiosulfate.  In addition to these agricultural products, the Facility produces the pesticides metam sodium and Enzone, as well as the metal extractant, Kermet.  Batch production of flowable sulfur and emulsified aqueous sulfur solution (used in the kraft paper industry) is also conducted at the facility.\n\nThese chemicals utilize several regulated and non-regulated substances as raw materials. The large number of products and their raw materials require loading/unloading operations at th"

Based on process knowledge, Tessenderlo Kerley identified two listed flammable substances (MMA and DMA) and two regulated toxic substances (anhydrous ammonia and carbon disulfide) kept on site above threshold quantities.\n\nThe regulated flammable substances stored on site at the Facility above threshold quantities are dimethylamine and monomethylamine (methylamine).  The regulated toxic substances stored onsite above threshold quantities are anhydrous ammonia and carbon disulfide.  \n\nThe process at the Finley Facility subject to the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program is classified as a Program 3 process under the program.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the Finley Facility.  The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  The facility is in the continuous process of reviewing the accident prevention program and as such is in various stages of implementing changes to improve work place safety.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are impleme"

Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Finley Facility actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is to be readily available to all employees.\n\nA variety of technical documents are to be kept that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \nNumerous technical documents are to be maintained that provid"

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  \n\nThe recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria: \n\n\u00b7 age of process; \n\u00b7 extent of process hazards; \n\u00b7 number of affected employees; and \n\u00b7 operating history of the process.  \n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten procedures are to be maintained that address various modes of process operations, such as; \n\n\u00b7 initial startup; \n\u00b7 normal operations; \n\u00b7 temporary operations; \n\u00b7 emergency shutdown; \n\u00b7 emergency operations; \n\u00b7 normal shutdown; \n\u00b7 startup following a turnaround; and \n\u00b7 startup after emergency shutdown.  \n\nThese procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  \n\nOperating procedures are to be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.

The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, there is to be a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees are to receive basic training in process operations and procedures. \n\nIn addition, all operators are periodically to receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is to be conducted at least every three years.  The appropriate frequency of training is to be based on management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is to be  documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Finley Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nDuring construction of new processes, all equipment to be installed is to be determined to be suitable for the process application.  Checks and inspections are to be performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include \n\n\u00b7 control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel; \n\u00b7 a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\n\u00b7 a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened; \n\u00b7 a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and \n\u00b7 a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThere is a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThere is a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive technique such as what if/checklist and failure mode and effect or the deductive fault tree technique.  \n\nThe analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  Thi"

Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractors employees, are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates (within 48 hours) all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\n\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor); and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  \n\nThe report includes dates of incident and of investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is fu"

Contract employee injury and illness log should be maintained.  Plant personnel are to periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nA PSSR should be conducted on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure those safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and adequate.  A PSSR verifies that a PHA has been conducted, recommendations resolved, and training of employees involved in the process prior to a start-up.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nWell established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment should be kept.
