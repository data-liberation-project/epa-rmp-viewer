      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention Policy \n\nThe City of Fort Doge, Iowa, John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is a responsible member of the community and is committed to operating its facility in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  The WTP will utilize its Risk Management Program to identify ways to reduce its use of hazardous materials and minimize potential risks to its employees, the community, and environment.  The WTP will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\n\n\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\nThe WTP has implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program to prevent the accidental release of chlorine gas from its plant at 600 Phinney Park Drive in Fort Dodge, Iowa.  At this location, the WTP uses chlorine gas to disinfectant drinking water prior to its distribution to area residences and businesses.  Chlorine gas, liquefied under pressure, is used in quantities that exceed EPA's regulatory threshold.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe WTP relies on several safeguards as part of its accidental release prevention program.  The WTP's designers and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components that are installed; standard operating procedures specify safe practices used at the plant; a maintenance program establishes proper testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures.  Also, hazard communication occurs frequently between management, operators, and employees during the process hazard analysis, process safety information reviews, training, safety briefings, and the annual program review.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nWithin the last 5 years, no accidental release of chlorine has resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known d"

      "SummaryText": "eaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, offsite.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response \n\nThe WTP has an emergency action program in place which outlines the actions to be taken for a facility evacuation, ammonia release, or natural disaster. The Emergency Action Plan has been coordinated with the Iowa Region 5 Hazardous Materials Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Fort Dodge Fire Department. It provides guidance for the notification, response and evacuation of John W. Pray Water Treatment Plant's employees.  The emergency action plan acknowledges the Fort Dodge Fire Department as the emergency coordinators and first responders.\n\n\n\nSafety Improvements \n\nThe City provides annual training that addresses emergency action to all plant employees.  The training program includes three levels of training: initial awareness training, annual refresher training, and emergency practice drills.  This Risk Management Plan and information used to prepare it are readily available to all WTP employees.  The installation of a vacuum chlorination system and replacement of the pressurized system eliminated several operational risks that once existed at the WTP.  \n\n"
