The facility produces non-fat dry milk powder, milk protein powder, and 43% butterfat cream.  The facility employs 105 people at this location. The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to maintain their product temperature. The system is defined as a closed loop \"Indirect\" type system.\n\nDairiConcepts has developed a risk management program to address 40 CFR Part 68 ?Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention? and to enhance already existing safety and emergency action programs. DairiConcepts is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. DairiConcepts staff are highly trained and utilize modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant.\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nDairiConcepts has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems. DairiConcepts policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is used to maintain the temperature of the product.\nThe system is composed of the following key components:\n - Five compressors\n - Four evaporative condensers\n - One high pressure receiver\n - One high pressure/ thermosyphon receiver\n - One thermosyphon receiver\n - Five Oil Separators\n - Four Oil Pots\n - Three accumulators\n - Four thermosyphon heat exchangers\n - One shell and tube glycol heat exchanger\n - Three plate and frame water chiller heat exchan"

      "SummaryText": "gers\n \nThe ammonia refrigeration system cycle begins at the high pressure receiver where liquid ammonia is fed from the receiver to the surge drum and from there to the heat exchanger.  At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature and evaporates while absorbing heat from the glycol or water.  A wet vapor mix is returned to the surge drum form the heat exchanger where the moisture is separated from the vapor.  The dry vapor is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure.  The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and condenses to a liquid and returns to the high pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per 40 CFR 68.25 regulations, one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the greatest amount held in a single vessel(the high pressure receiver), taking into account administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity  in ten (10) minutes. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation features was taken for the worst-case release scenario. The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by 40 CFR 68.22 regulations. ALOHA was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm. The results show the off-site areas that will be affected. This worst case release scenario is highly unlikely to occur because of active mitigation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikely as well.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of anhydrous ammonia vapor as a result of an ammonia relief valve relieving for 10 minute"

For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is located in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation 40 CFR 68.28 for alternative release scenarios were used. ALOHA was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm. The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario. \nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; DairiConcepts has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n - There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n - There are ammonia sensors in place to allow early detection of a release.\n - The facility has an Emergency Dump Tank that will absorb the ammonia charge into an enclosed tank of water.  \n - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by plant personnel, as necessary.\n - The history of the DairiConcepts facility (i.e., no applicable ammonia releases) reflects the adequa"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The EPA Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n - Process Safety Information\n - Process Hazard Analysis\n - Operating Procedures\n - Training\n - Management of Change\n - Pre-Startup Review\n - Compliance Audits\n - Incident Investigation\n - Employee Participation\n - Hot Work Permit\n - Contractors\n - Emergency Response Plan\n \nIn the RMP Submit document under Compliance Audits (items 7.10 a & b) a compliance audit has not been required for this facility as of this date therefore the date for this item was left blank.  Incident Investigation (item 7.11 a & b): as of this date there have been no incidents to investigate, therefore the date for this item is blank.\n \nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no applicable releases of ammonia at DairiConcepts in the past 5 years.\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nDairiConcepts has filed a Chemical Inventory Business Plan with the local Fire Department and this plan includes:\n - Emergency Alarm Procedures\n - Evacuation Procedures\n - Safety and Health Considerations\n - Notification Procedures\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSeveral studies have been conducted to examine mitigation measures to improve safety at DairiConcepts. These studies include the following: Process Hazard Analysis, and Hazard Assessment.  Any outstanding recommendations from these studies will have been addressed by March 18, 2005."
