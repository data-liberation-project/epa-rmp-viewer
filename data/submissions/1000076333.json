Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures,\n\nequipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices)\n\ninherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases\n\nof hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe\n\ndesign of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response\n\nplan includes procedures for the notification of the Valero Emergency Response Team and other appropriate local\n\nresponders so that appropriate measures can be taken to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR,\n\nPart 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios\n\ndescribed were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen. Our refinery customer uses the\n\nhydrogen. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as feedstock. The feedstock is reacted in\n\nthe reformer furnace. By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,600\n\ndegrees F.) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon\n\nmonoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then\n\nseparated from the hydrogen in "

This facility was designed and\n\nconstructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4. Five year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas within the past five years.\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard. At this site,\n\nemployees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.\n\nThey have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level. The employees will receive annual\n\nrefresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities will be coordinated with\n\nthe Valero Emergency Response Team.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in\n\nmodifications to the plant design and operating procedures.\n\n"
