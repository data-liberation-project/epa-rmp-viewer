We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help insure the safety of our employees, the public and the environment.  We follow the DuPont Corporate philosophy that the \"goal is zero\".  This means that we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  We have programs, procedures and management practices in place to support our goal of zero.  Our site safety, operating and emergency response procedures are available to all site employees through hard copies and/or electronic copies on computers placed throughout the plant.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe DuPont Fayetteville Works site consists of approximately 2200 acres located on the Bladen and Cumberland County line adjacent to N.C. Highway 87.  It is approximately 15 miles southeast of Fayetteville, North Carolina.  Approximately 400 acres are currently used for manufacturing, with the remainder set aside for future manufacturing needs.\nThe NAFION(TM) and APFO processes at the DuPont Fayetteville Works are Prevention Program 3 processes.  The NAFION(TM) process produces a membrane used in fuel cells and the Chloralkali industry.  In the production of that product, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials:\n   - Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous (received and TFE/HCL Distillate)\n   - Tetrafluoroethylene (received as TFE/HCL Distillate)\n   - Sulfur Trioxide\nAPFO is a material used in the TEFLON polymer manufacturing process.  To produce APFO, the following regulated substance is used as a raw material:\n   - Oleum\n\nWORST CASE TOXIC RELEASE SCENARIO\nThis information is not to be included in the Executive Summary of the 2004 update of the RMP.\n\nWORST CASE FLAMMABLE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThis information is not to be "

Our safety programs include guidelines which include a documented process technology system covering the hazards of materials, equipment design basis and process design basis.  It includes the requirement to choose materials of construction to provide mechanical integrity and incorporates extensive safety instrumentation such as alarms, interlocks, and gas detectors.  It also includes identifying all process safety critical equipment and performing routine inspections to insure proper operation and mechanical integrity.  A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance work performed.  Our maintenance and operations personnel are trained, qualified and experienced.  The guidelines also include the requirement for operators and mechanics to follow approved procedures.  Processes are continually monitored by computer control systems and operators.  These individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no on site injuries and no off site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage due to the accidental release of RMP regulated substances from the DuPont Fayetteville Works in the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOur program provides planning and training to effectively protect our employees, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  An emergency response plan is in place and updated regularly and all employees are trained for their role in the emergency response plan.  The plant conducts emergency drills, and critiques are held after drills and actual "

Every person on the site has a responsibility to improve the safety of our operations.  As part of our Process Hazards Analysis process, teams consisting of operators, mechanics, technical engineers and management thoroughly examine and evaluate our manufacturing operations on a periodic frequency to identify risk reduction opportunities.  Audits, both first party and second party, are conducted using site based personnel and non-site based personnel to evaluate compliance with safety, environmental, occupational health and process safety management requirements and regulations.  Findings are documented and tracked to closure."
