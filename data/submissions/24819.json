Our mission includes a commitment to act as responsible neighbors in our communities. We will accomplish our mission by adhering with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. The facility has developed an emergency action plan and has coordinated emergency activities with the Schuykill County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nThis facility produces meat products for market distribution and ultimately for public consumption. Raw product is received as boxed beef and pork, and is then repacked into case-ready products. Anhydrous ammonia is the only risk management program regulated substance processed at the facility in excess of threshold quantities. Ammonia is used for mechanical refrigeration throughout the plant for all areas that require cooling. The system includes receiving tanks, compressors, chillers, freezers, condensers, and associated piping, valves, and other equipment. \n\nOur worst-case release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration system is a catastrophic failure of the high pressure recirculator, resulting in a release of ammonia. The maximum quantity of ammonia in the tank is limited to the entire ammonia charge at the facility (approximately 15,000 pounds). The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 1.5 miles according to the look-up tables provided in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidance document for ammonia refrigeration systems. Public receptors identified within 1.5 miles of the facility include residences, commercial/industrial areas, and a recreational area. No environmental receptors were identified within the distance to endpoint. An alternative release scenario was also analyzed. The alternative release scenario examined a release of approximately 10,800 pounds of ammonia resulting from a catastrophic failure of the same vessel under normal operating conditions.

No environmental receptors were identified.\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. In addition, the facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulation. Our prevention program includes written operating and mechanical integrity procedures, safe work practices, a contractor safety program, management of change, and pre-startup safety reviews. In addition, we have implemented a training program to ensure that our employees are knowledgeable in the hazards of the process and in their specific job functions. If an incident does occur, it is thoroughly investigated and the findings of the investigation are communicated to all affected employees. We believe our prevention program is key to minimizing the risk to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had an accident involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving ammonia, we will notify the Schuykill County Emergency Management Agency and request that they respond to the emergency. Our emergency action plan has been coordinated with the agency.\n\nAlthough we do not have any active projects to improve the safety of our systems, it is our policy to continuously work towards better and safer systems."
