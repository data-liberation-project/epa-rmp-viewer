This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Gas Processing System.  Signal Hill Petroleum's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility utilizes the Gas Processing System to process natural gas that is supplied from the field.  Process Safety Information contains the inventory calculations for the system.  \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and processing of flammables has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Signal Hill Petroleum has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event.  In addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a flammable release:\n\n-There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n-The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n-Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\n\n-A well designed relief system\n\n \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of CalARP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were d"

Specifically, the external events requirements were met with the following actions:\n\nDescription of the types of natural and human caused external events considered in PHA Section 2760.2 or Hazard Review Section 2755.2.  \n\n- During the Process Hazard Analysis, a broad list of external events was considered by the Team.

The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. If not known, the owner or operator of the stationary source shall work closely with the AA to determine what is required.
