The facility will adopt current recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) for changes to the covered process under the Management of Change (MOC) program element. \r\n\r\nAmmonia safety considerations incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration system as accidental release mitigation measures include ammonia gas detection sensors in the cold storage areas (freezer and dock areas) that are interlocked shut off ammonia flow to affected portions of the system and pump the ammonia vapor from the system back to accumulator vessels in the engine room, and in the engine room that activate exhaust ventilation and initiate system shutdown.  Further, ammonia detection on any sensor at the occupational exposure limit of ammonia will activate an employee alarm system.\r\n\r\nProcess controls include an automated refrigeration control panel with micro-controllers on each compressor package. The control system is equipped with high level (liquid and pressure) cutouts and compressor interlocks to mitigate process deviations.  Pressure vessels are equipped with safety relief valves that discharge to a relief vent header above the facility in the event of a system over pressure condition. The facility is equipped with an emergency pressure control system (EPCS), which is a pressure-limiting safety system that activates in an over-pressure situation above the setpoint pressure, but below the relief valve set pressure, to allow the portion of the system subject to over-pressure to be relieved of its pressure by moving refrigerant through a solenoid valve to a lower pressure portion of the system.  Manual emergency shut down and exhaust ventilation controls are also provided at the outer entrance to the engine room.  \r\n \r\nPreferred Freezer Services has implemented an eme"

      "SummaryText": "The facility's primary activity is temperature-controlled storage of food products and the facility handles anhydrous ammonia within a closed-loop refrigeration system. Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r).  All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant and the quantity of anhydrous ammonia within the refrigeration system is approximately 13,700 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  \r\n\r\nEPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, which is authorized under 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), requires that facilities that have covered processes establish a Risk Management Program (RMP) to reduce the risks of accidental release of toxic or flammable materials and establish emergency response procedures in the event of an accident. This Executive Summary, in conjunction with the Prevention Program summary in this RMP submittal, summarizes key provisions of Preferred Freezer Services implementation of the RMP in conjunction with its PSM Program (herein referred to as the PSM/RMP program).\r\n\r\nA management system has been implemented to oversee the facility PSM/RMP program. The management system clearly delineates lines of authority and responsibility to ensure that all elements of the accidental release prevention programs are implemented. The General Manager of the facility has overall responsibility for PSM/RMP program implementation and compliance with the program requirements. Oversight of the PSM//RMP program is provided by Preferred Freezer Services' Corporate Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) department. Corporate HSE conducts an annual PSM/RMP program review and leads the triennial program audits and 5-year PHA revalidations.  \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the facility was designed and cons"

The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that have resulted in onsite or offsite consequences (deaths, injuries, significant property damage, evacuations, sheltering in place, environmental damage, or a reportable quantity of ammonia released to the atmosphere) in the past five-years.\r\n\r\nThrough the ongoing implementation of the PSM/RMP program including annual program reviews, triennial program audits, process hazard analysis revalidations, and mechanical integrity inspections, the facility continually evaluates system enhancements to reflect current RAGAGEP to improve safety at the facility."
