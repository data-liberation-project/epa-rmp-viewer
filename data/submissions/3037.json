Additionally, operators receive training annually covering safety and emergency response issues, as mandated by EPA.\n\nPreventive Maintenance Program - RRAD has instituted a preventive maintenance program for its three covered processes to minimize the chance of accidental releases due to process equipment failures.  This includes a formal, periodic maintenance schedule, and retention of an adequate spare parts inventory.\n\nAccurate, Effective Operating Procedures - RRAD has updated its operating procedures, with the participation of process operators.  The procedures address normal operating procedures, as well as steps to be taken during upset conditions, and safety precautions to be observed during all operational phases.\n\nPeriodic Hazard Reviews of Equipment and Procedures - RRAD has instituted periodic hazard reviews, including Process Hazard Analyses.  This function includes reviewing both equipment and procedures, and recommending and instituting changes to improve safety and minimize the chance of accidental releases.  \n\nImplementation of an Auditing and Inspection Program - RRAD is initiating a Process Compliance Audit Program as required by the RMP Rule.  This will involve inspection of the processes by an Audit Team familiar with their operation, followed by formal reporting to management and appropriate corrective actions.  Items addressed include adherence to documented operation and maintenance procedures; record keeping; and whether the process is generally being operated in a safe manner.  \n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators during connection/disconnection of gas cylinders, and awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  Additionally, portable gas measurement instruments have been purchased.\n\nFinally, the RRAD and LSAAP are both secured facilities.  Entrants t"

Additionally, all three of the RRAD covered processes are surrounded by chain-link security fences, and gated; the gates are locked whenever an operator is not present.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History   \n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred over the past five years.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nRRAD has an emergency response program, including its own fully equipped fire department.  The post fire department includes a total staff of 25, and RRAD has Mutual Aid Agreements in effect with 13 surrounding communities.  Eighteen of the 25 fire department staff are EMT-trained, while the remaining 7 are in training.  The RRAD medical office is available for treatment of non-critical situations; victims can be transferred to full-service hospitals via ambulance or airlift in critical cases.  The department conducts its own training on a daily basis, and conducts periodic mock drills to maintain response readiness.      \n\nRRAD has a documented plan for emergency notification in case of accidental releases.  The main fire department phone is staffed 24 hours per day, and the post's internal phone system includes a 911 emergency notification number.  Finally, the fire department conducts its own safety inspections at RRAD; high hazard buildings are inspected monthly, while all other buildings are inspected quarterly.  \n\nRRAD has also developed process-specific emergency response procedures.\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on an assessment by an outside contractor in June, 1998, and February, 1999, several changes are being instituted to improve safety at RRAD's covered processes.  These include:\n\n7 relocation of SCBAs at the IWWTP to boxes on the outside of the building, and storage of same as             self- contained units;\n\n7 updating of the existing SCBA vendor contract to keep inspection, maintenance, etc. on an ac"

The EPA' Publication RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, subsequently referred to as EPA Guidance, specifies a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L for chlorine, and 0.0078 mg/L for sulfur dioxide.  The toxic endpoint is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance is defined as the population potentially affected.  EPA Publication 550-B-98-010, Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was consulted to determine the toxic endpoint distance.  A distance of 1.3 miles was obtained for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The affected population was calculated at 140 using the Landview database; this database is available to the general public over the Internet.\n\nA worst-case release scenario was also calculated for the WWTP.  For this processe, the worst-case scenario analysis was based on failure of a 2,000 pound chlorine cylinder, releasing all contents over a ten minute period.  Using EPA Publication 550-B-98-010, a toxic endpoint radius of 1.3 miles was obtained.  The affected population within this radius is zero, as the entire area is located within property owned by the U.S. Army (RRAD and LSAAP).  No public or environmental receptors are located within this radius, including residences.\n\n40 CFR Part 68.28 requires that an alternative release scenario analysis be performed for each covered process having potential public impacts under the worst-case scenario.  Again, EPA Publication 550-B-98-010 was used to calculate an alternative release scenario for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the IWWTP"

The valve stem protrudes approximately 2 inches from the surface of the cylinder, and is expected to be the most likely point of failure.  The calculated distance to toxic endpoint was 0.4 miles for both substances.  At present, no public or environmental receptors are located within this circle, including residences.  However, a portion of the land within this circle may be transferred to commercial interests in the near future. \n\nAn alternative release scenario analysis is not required for the WWTP, since the worst-case analysis showed no potential impacts to public or environmental receptors. \n\nEPA Guidance mandates that worst-case meteorological conditions must be used for worst-case scenario analyses.  This was done by using a Stability of F, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, temperature of 25 0C, and relative humidity of 50%.  For the alternative release scenario analyses, the specified conditions include a Stability of  D, wind speed of 3 meters per second, temperature of 25 0C, and relative humidity of 50%.  The EPA Guidance was adhered to in both cases.\n\nFor the IWWTP Chemical Storage Area worst-case release scenario, it should be emphasized that the affected population estimate is very conservative.  It is based on the entire population within the radius of the distance to endpoint, when in fact an actual release would take the form of a more linear plume, which would affect only a fraction of the area within the radius.\n\nOn the basis of these analyses, the WWTP is classified as a Program Level 1 process, while the IWWTP Chemical Storage Area is classified as a Program Level 3 process.\n\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source \n\nThe Red River Army Depot (RRAD) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The RRAD emergency response policy will entail the preparation of process-specific response plans, and is integrated with emergency services available in the surrounding communities.  This policy will comply with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nRRAD includes two processes that are subject to the RMP Rule. The Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) treats sewage from both the RRAD and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant (LSAAP), and is actually located on LSAAP property.  This plant uses chlorine, which is stored in a maximum of two 2,000 pound cylinders.  The Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWWTP) Chemical Storage Area is located near the IWWTP, and serves as RRAD's primary chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinder storage area; cylinders are delivered here, then distributed to the water treatment plants as required.  The IWWTP Chemical Storage area may contain up to six 2,000 pound cylinders each of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  \n\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWorst-case release scenarios were analyzed for both covered processes as mandated by 40 CFR Part 68.25.  The EPA requires that impacts be calculated based on the release of all contents of the largest chemical vessel involved in the process over a ten-minute period.  It should be stressed that this is a very unlikely condition, because of the prevention program currently in place.  The worst-case release scenario for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide was determined to be failure of a single cylinder at the IWWTP C"
