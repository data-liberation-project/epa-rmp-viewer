Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Lemoore uses gas chlorine stored at its Wastewater Treatment Plant (LWWTP) as a disinfectant to lower the total and fecal coliform counts to within the requirements of the State of California. This report discusses the LWWTP chlorination facility.\nThe chlorine stored at the chlorination facility on the LWWTP property is liquefied gas under pressure; therefore it is considered a hazardous material and is a regulated substance under the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP). The Kings County Health Department's Division of Environmental Health Services recognized the LWWTP facility as a Stationary Source under the CalARP regulations and requested this Risk Management Plan (RMP). The City of LemooreA?s policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations. Safety depends upon proper construction design and safety features of the facility, accurate operating and emergency procedures, and effective training of personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nFor the LWWTP chlorination facility, chlorine is used as a disinfectant to lower the total and fecal coliform counts to within the regulatory requirements. The process consists of chlorine gas being drawn from a one-ton cylinder by vacuum and injected into the wastewater flow with a submersible pump. There are four one-ton cylinders at the LWWTP chlorination facility; two of the one-ton cylinders are connected to the chlorinator and two cylinders are kept in reserve.\n\n3a. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for interconnected equipment must consider the largest quantity of a regulated substance handled on site in a single vessel at any time, taking into account administrative controls on the vesselA?s contents and usage as per the CCR Title 19 Division 2 Chapter 4.5 Article 2 Section 2750.3(b).\n\nOne of the six 2,000-lb chlorine cylinders is considered the larg"

      "SummaryText": "est vessel in the chlorine feed system. The one-ton cylinder is, at most, filled with 2,000 lbs of liquid chlorine, which is 67% of the cylinder's capacity. The Worst Case release scenario for a chlorine cylinder is the release of the entire capacity at a rate of 200 lbs per minute for a ten-minute duration.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm (0.0087 mg/L) is 3 miles. This release would extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3b. Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for the one-ton cylinder is complete failure and separation of a quarter-inch fuse plug in the end of the cylinder. All 2,000 lbs of chlorine is assumed to flash to vapor.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of 3 ppm (0.0087 mg/L) is 0.6 miles and would extend beyond the boundaries of the stationary source.\n\n3c. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict, to a minimum, the amount of chlorine lost from a one-ton cylinder if an accidental release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. These administrative controls are inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine unloading process system and the training provided to the operators. Administrative controls are also in place for the ammonia unloading system.\n\n3d. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exist to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum, if a release were to occur; and preferably to not have a release occur. The mitigation measures are based on the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine unloading process system and their related equipment and components. Mitigation measures are also in effect for the ammonia unloading system.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable Federal and State codes and regulations. There are safety meetin"

The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine and the ammonia unloading systems and the related activities and equipment represent the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program. \n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere was one accidental release of chlorine that occured on April 3, 2008.  This accidental release occurred while a CIty Employee was changing the regulator on the chlorine tank.  The valve did not close completely and the employee inhaled some chlorine gas.  The problem was immediately remedied and no significant source of chlorine gas was released into the environment.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon the alerting of personnel at the facility to evacuate or shelter-in-place and await the arrival of responders from the City of Lemoore Fire Department at the assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation or the shelter-in-place to be initiated.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCurrent applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) program to determine if commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process. These commitments address prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substances. The completion schedules for these commitments are included in the PSM."
