In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\nLike all PSM/RM programs, ours contains the following major elements:\n\nGeneral Company Policy\nEmployee Participation\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nStandard Operating Procedures\nTraining\nContractor Qualifications\nPre-Startup Safety Review\nMechanical Integrity Program\nHot Work Permit\nMa"

Damon Smith will review and update the program as necessary.  Copies of the written program may be reviewed by checking with Damon for access to the appropriate information.  We encourage all suggestions because we are committed to the success of our PSM/RM program.  We strive for a comprehensive, integrated prevention system which obtains clear understanding, safe behavior, and involvement in the program from every level of the facility and the public.\n\n\nSection 2\n\nOverview of the System\nLone Star Bakery prepares bakery items and supplies various retail merchandisers.  Some items are frozen on spiral freezers and are held in a freezer until shipped.  Packaging and material storage areas are kept at approximately 40 degrees.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has three suction temperature systems.  The packaging and dock system is operated at 20 to 25 PSIG(5 to 10 degrees).  The freezer system is operated at 4 to 5 PSIG(-20 to -17 degrees).  The spiral or blast system is operated at 2 to 5 InHg(-35 to -30 degrees).\n\nCurrently six compressors, two for each system are operated as single stage compressors discharging to the common high stage discharge piping that leads to three evaporative condensers.  The liquid ammonia from these condensers is piped to a common high pressure receiver.\n\nA portion of the liquid leaving the receiver is subcooled through a subcooling vessel before entering the low temperature recirculators.\n\nSection 3\n\nWorst Case Scenario\nFailure of the high pressure receiver containing 7330 pounds of ammonia  with the\nreceiver capacity quantity limited to 50% of vessel capacity by facil"

As a result 400 pounds per min are released for a period of ten minutes.\n\nThs scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nIndustry standards for the manufacture and quality control of  vessels.\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service.\nPressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel.\nThe mechanical integrity program in place at this facility for regular     maintenance,\ninspection and replacement of equipment  on a timely basis.\nFailure of several systems would have to occur to allow this scenario to\nhappen.\n\nDistance to endpoint is calculated to be 0.3 miles, using RMP*Comp."
