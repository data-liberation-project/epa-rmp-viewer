Facility Policy: \n  The owners, management, and employees of Don Keys Fertilizer Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Edgar County ESDA, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: \n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 350,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:\n\n  a. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of ten minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the endpoint, (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm), is 1.10 miles.\n\n  b. The alternate release scenario: a 1.25 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate scenerio followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic shut-off valve is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quanity released would be 6,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint, (point of dispersion to 200 ppm), is .41 mile. (The most likely potential incident would be a release from a break in a 1 inch transfer hose  scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quanity releas"

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n  The facility is in compliance with the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the State of IL, Fertilizer Law, Subpart A, Anhydrous Ammonia. The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5. Five Year Accident History.\n  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or enironmental damage.\n\n6. Emergeny Action Plan.\n  This facility has:\n  a. A written action plan, in accordance with Osha standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n  b. Provided state and local authorites with the emergency planning and community right to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n  c. If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call  911 and all applicable emergency response numbers. 1. Within 15 minutes of determining that the amount of the release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coordinator will notify: National Response Center at 800-424-8802  2. Immediately (within one hour) after determining that the amount of release will be over 100 pounds, The Emergency Coordinator will notify: Illinois Environmental Agency at 800-782-7860 (in state) or 217-782-7860 (out of state)\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n  Safety improvement is an on going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to access the conditions of the facility. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for i"
