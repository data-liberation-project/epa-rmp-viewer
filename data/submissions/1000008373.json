Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \n\nThe Baton Rouge Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n\nThe CWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the central area of the City's urban perimeter including the Louisiana State University campus, and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine.  The use of this chemical makes the CWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and the related accident prevention (Risk Management Program) regulations, as enacted by the USEPA at 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nChlorine.  The CWWTP has two 5,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank's working capacity is limited, by means of administrative controls, to a maximum of approximately 4,000 gallons, or no more than 50,000 lb. of  liquid chlorine.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are enclosed inside a steel-frame and concrete building.\n\nSulfur Dioxide.  This chemical is no longer in use in the CWWTP.  B"

There is no longer any sulfur dioxide inventory maintained on site at the CWWTP.\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 includes, among other items, the development of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for the possible release of significant quantities of the regulated toxic substance (chlorine).  Originally, these requirements also called for the Executive Summary (ES) to include a discussion of the WSC and ARS for each toxic chemical.\n\nPer the above, the ES of the original RMP submitted to the USEPA in 1999 presented and discussed these scenarios and the hypothetical offsite consequences in some detail.  Considering that the operation of the chlorination system have not undergone any changes that would affect the scenarios or their underlying assumptions, these scenarios are still valid. However, they will not be discussed here any further.  In accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18837, April 9, 2004), a discussion of the WCS and ARS is no longer required for inclusion in this ES.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n1.0\tSafety Information\n\nThe Central Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemical (not only chlorine but sodium hydroxide solution - caustic - as well, even though this chemical is not regulated under 40 CFR Part 68); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of these chemicals; and data on equipment design and specifications.\n\nThese documents include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n* Copies of current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS\u00c2\u00bfs) fo"

They show material inventories and a record of the shipments of chemicals delivered on site.\n\nThe above records are updated as applicable and necessary.\n\n2.0 \tHazard Review\n\nA detailed review of the hazards (Process Hazard Assessment, or PHA) associated with the operation of the chlorination  system at the CWWTP was last performed in June of 2004 and a new was recently performed.  The PHA was performed by using the Process Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique, to identify any hazards and to ensure that the necessary controls are in place to manage such hazards.  The HAZOP report is currently being prepared and will be finalized in the very near future.  The HAZOP technique was the same PHA technique used in the two previous PHA's, performed in in 1999 and 2004, respectively.\n\nA team of individuals representing the operations, maintenance, safety, engineering and management departments was selected to conduct the HAZOP review. The report will present and discuss the \"Action Items (AI)\" identified.  This report will be submitted to management for resolution.  The corrective action(s) identified for each action item will be documented, addressed and resolved as applicable and necessary. \n\n\n3.0 \tOperating Procedures\n\nThe CWWTP keeps on site copies of all operating and maintenance procedures that were prepared and submitted to the city by the plant design firm.  These procedures address not only normal plant operations but other operating modes such as start-up, normal shut-down, emergency shut-downs, start-up following emergency shut-downs, etc.  These procedures also address the removal"

These audits determine how effectively the policies and procedures of the RMP have been implemented.  The audit findings are submitted to management for resolution and corrective action as necessary and applicable.

Major sections of the Plan are as follows:\n* Description of the uses of Chlorine within the plant\n* Physical Properties of Chlorine \n* Safety measures that must be taken before working in a Chlorine environment\n* Description of monitoring, warning and alarm systems in place at the Chlorine building\n* Description of Leak-containing features of the chlorine storage systems\n* Description of safety features and measures provided at the chlorine facilities.\n* Accessibility restrictions in the chlorine area\n* Personnel responsibilities during a chlorine emergency, including local and evacuation alarms.\n* List of emergency call numbers to be contacted (local agencies and public)\n* Communications with the media and with the public\n* Emergencies requiring public action\n* Emergency medical treatments\n* Closure of emergency condition\n* Plant evacuation checklist\n* Chlorine system design specification summary\n\nThe final version of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan was issued in 1997, at approximately the time that the chlorine systems were installed. This plan has been revised and updated several times since, with the latest review being done in March, 2,009.\n\nAt the State of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality's (LDEQ's) request, the full text of the emergency response plan was submitted in 2001 as part of a few minor corrections made to the RMP at that time.

These drills also involve the participation of and are executed under the guidance of the Baton Rouge HazMat team and the Baton Rouge Fire Department.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe original design of the CWWTP included a liquid chlorine feed system, which would flow through an evaporator system to convert it into chlorine vapor.  As a response to  some action items identified during the previous HAZOP analysis, the CWWTP converted the chlorination system from liquid to vapor feed.  This change has virtually eliminated all pressurized liquid chlorine lines from the system, with the sole exception of the liquid chlorine unloading line, which is full of liquid chlorine only while a chlorine truckload is being unloaded into the storage tank.\n\nNo other changes to improve the safety of the chlorination system are planned for the near future."
