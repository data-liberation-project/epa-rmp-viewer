      "SummaryText": "Nomaco, headquartered in Zebulon, NC, is a manufacturer of plastic foam products.  These products are used in a variety of applications including packaging, pipe insulation, and assorted consumer goods.  The company has a strong commitment to preserving the safety of its employees and surrounding communities, as well as minimizing impacts on the environment.  As a result of this commitment, Nomaco redesigned the manufacturing process of all of its plants to phase out the use of Hydroflurocarbon-containing gases (HCFCs) which deplete the ozone layer.  After much research, Nomaco decided to replace HCFCs with isobutane gas.  Isobutane is used in the foam manufacturing process as a blowing agent.  It is a regulated substance with about the same flammability as lighter fluid and propane.  Due to the flammability potential, there is a strict no-smoking policy inside the building as well as on the premises.  Smoking is limited to designated areas outside of the building.\n\nThe safe storage and handling of isobutane is guided by specific procedures which address regular maintenance of the storage and handling equipment.  In addition to procedures, a sophisticated gas detection system is used to continuously monitor gas levels.  There are gas detectors located throughout the manufacturing facility as well as in product storage locations.  The system signals facility personnel of any gas concentration release reaching 10% of the lower explosion limit (LEL).  At 20% LEL and at 40% LEL, additional visual / audible alarms are activated.  Details of the sensor and warning system are contained in Section 9 of the PHA Report.  The risk of accidental release is therefore minimized.\n\nPropane is used for fuel in maintenance and fork-lift vehicles required to move materials around the plant.  However, there is no central propane storage tank on site since the facility operates by exchanging the 7.5-gallon tanks on the vehicles.  Annual propane usage is expected to be approximately 25,3"

      "SummaryText": "44 gallons or 112,000 pounds.  The maximum stored on site at any time in 7.5-gallon containers is estimated to be less than 1,000 pounds.  Flammable fuels used as fuel or held for sale at a retail facility are removed from coverage by the RMP program by the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (Public Law 106-40).  Therefore, propane use at the facility is not addressed in this RMP."
