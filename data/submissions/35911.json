Employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAPCI facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  APCI makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility manufactures, receives, stores, and ships chemicals which are primarily used in the electronics and semiconductor industry.  The regulated substances handled are anhydrous ammonia, ammonium hydroxide, and hydrochloric acid.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.apci.com or contact the Plant Manager at 214-372-7779.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with written operating and maintenance procedures.  The operations at this facility are ISO 9002 certified.
