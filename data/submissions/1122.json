This team is trained to respond to and mitigate all chlorine leaks.\n\nAll CCS employees are trained to be aware of potential chlorine leaks, or spills and to promptly report them. The chlorine process area has continuous monitoring and an alarm system. Annual training and drills are conducted as a demonstration of the HAZMAT team's competency. The HAZMAT team has standard operating procedures for response to a chlorine emergency. In addition, the plant has on-site and off-site evacuation and notification procedures.\n\nThe PSM Team meets every three years, and following any incident. Changes to procedures and/or process are implemented based upon the team's recommendation. The team continually improves process safety and reduces the potential of a release."

      "SummaryText": "Coal Creek Station (CCS) is a lignite-fired electrical generation plant, consisting of two 550MW generating units. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the cooling water process. The maximum chlorine storage is 40,000 pounds, with an average daily disinfectant usage of 500 pounds per day.\n\nCCS has used the release of a one ton chlorine container in 10 minutes as the worst-case release scenario. The estimated distance to a safe endpoint (Determined by EPA Look-up tables) is two miles. Chlorine containers and the chlorination system are located inside the circulating water pumphouse. There has never been an instantaneous chlorine release in CCS's 20-year operating history. \n\nFor an alternate release scenario a gas leak from a one-ton chlorine container connecting piping was used. In this scenario the facility assumes that the leak will be stopped in one hour. CCS has emergency repair kits on sites designed by the Chlorine Institute to contain any chlorine leak. CCS also has a Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Team trained on chlorine response and container repair. The cooling water process area has a continuous chlorine-monitoring device that will alarm in the facility control room in the event of a chlorine leak. Early detection of a leak will initiate immediate response and mitigation. The estimated safe endpoint (Determined by EPA Look-up tables) would be 0.06 miles. \n\nCCS has an excellent five-year accident history. No chlorine gas leaks have occurred\nCCS is in compliance with the North Dakota Emergency Response requirements and developed a SARA Site Specific Emergency Response Plan in September of 1992. That plan is on file at the Local Emergency Planning Commission, State of North Dakota Director of Emergency Response, and local fire departments. Annually documentation of hazardous chemicals stored on site is reported to the same agencies and authorities. CCS is in compliance with Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule"
