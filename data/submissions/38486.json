This commitment is inherent to an accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at Equistar LaPorte.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nEquistar LaPorte\u00bfs primary activities encompass olefins and polymer and resins manufacturing.  We have the following regulated substance present at Equistar LaPorte; butadiene, butane, 1-butene, ethylene, propylene, isopentane, acetaldehyde, and vinyl acetate monomer.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA using tables and equations has been employed by Equistar LaPorte to perform worst and alternative case release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from butadiene storage in the ethylene manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 3,000,000 pounds of butadiene.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum"

The release is assumed to result from a piping failure.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 55,000 lbs. of 1-butene.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is approximately 0.2 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from vinyl acetate monomer storage in the polymers and resins manufacturing process.  The scenario involves the release of 2,600 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release from vinyl acetate monomer storage in the polymers and resins manufacturing process.  The release is assumed to result from a piping failure.  The scenario involves the release of approximately 10,000 lbs. of vinyl acetate monomer in 31 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, the maximum distance of approximately 0.3 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 0.26 mg/L.  \n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEquistar LaPorte has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, (1967 Edition).  A number of processes at Equistar LaPorte are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses are unit PHA\u00bfs.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated on an as needed basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Equistar LaPorte maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nEquistar LaPorte has a training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nEquistar LaPorte carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Equistar LaPorte.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEquistar LaPorte conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEquistar LaPorte investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an employee injury or a significant release of a hazardous material.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEquistar LaPorte believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
