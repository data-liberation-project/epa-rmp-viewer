It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe locaiton, and notify the BODE Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what we may have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the BODE, Iowa location is DOUG YETMAR, Fertilizer Department Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency response numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE NEW COOPERATIVE BODE FERTILIZER PLANT\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.

      "SummaryText": "ty is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThis system consists of ONE (1) 26,000 gallon, one 12,000 gallon, and two 11,000 gallon storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three (3) months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is one (1).\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 110,500 pounds, which represents the volume of that tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 2.2 miles. The Alternate Release Scenario, based on either the 5-year accident history or the most likely potential incident are as follows: a release in a break from a 3-inch transfer hose followed by a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shutoff intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of BODE, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State law.\n\nIn addition the company has specific operating "

Finally, NEW Cooperative has extended to the Bode Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simmulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelterings in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous system, it is the policy of NEW Cooperative to immediately notify the Bode Volunteer Fire Department and the Region 5 LEPC to request that they respond to the emergency. In the unlikely event that the Bode Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Bode location, mutal aid (reciprocal agreement between neighboring fire departments) will be summoned. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Region 5 LEPC. Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nSafety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage for use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
