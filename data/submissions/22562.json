Once again, the team recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nThe details of this program are also identified in Section II, Part E of the PSM Manual.\n\n4.\tOperating Procedures\n\nThe Greasy Creek Plant and Loading Terminal maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to determine if they are current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.   To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in caring out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.  See also Section II, Part F of the PSM Manual.\n\n5.\tTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Greasy Creek Plant and Loading Terminal have various training programs available for operations personnel.

Employee suggestions on improving safety processes are encouraged at these meetings. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are also documented in Section II, Part C of the PSM Manual.\n\n2.\tProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Greasy Creek Plant and Loading Terminal keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The documents include the PSM Process Hazard Analysis, process flow diagrams, piping & instrument diagrams, vendor data books (equipment specifications & operation), description of process chemistry, inventory of hazardous chemicals, operating manual (upper/lower operating limits, startup, shutdown, etc.) and electrical classification drawings.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's).

      "SummaryText": "Transok / Greasy Creek -RMP / Executive Summary\n\n\nA.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nThe Greasy Creek Plant & Loading Terminal has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Transok's policy for the design and operation of gas plants (& loading facilities) is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to and attempt to control and contain the release.\n\nB.\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nTransok operates the Greasy Creek Plant located 7 miles South and 4 miles East of Wetumka, Oklahoma in Hughes County.  The plant's propane loading terminal is located 7 miles South of Wetumka on Highway 75.  The Greasy Creek Plant receives natural gas with some condensed hydrocarbon liquids (i.e. condensate) from production wells by pipeline system.  The Plant separates ethane, propane, butanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbon components from natural gas by liquefying them at cryogenic temperatures. The natural gas minus these liquefied components (called residue gas) is delivered back into the pipeline system for ultimate use as fuel.  \n\nThe natural gas liquids (NGL's or Raw Mix) are sold separately for petrochemical feedstock, fuel, and other uses.  The NGL's are delivered into a Koch Company pipeline connected to the plant.  Propane is also fractionated from this Y-Grade stream at the plant is delivered by Transok pipeline 4 miles to the highway-loading terminal.\n\nThe Greasy Creek Plant & Loading Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Transok identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on s"

The chemicals, largest quantities on site, and associated threshold quantities are presented in Section II - Accident Release Prevention Program, Table 1.  \n\nListed flammable substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the Greasy Creek Plant and Loading Terminal, are NGL's (product), methane and condensate.  However, Transok has determined that condensate has an NFPA rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  There are no listed toxic substances stored above threshold quantities at the Greasy Creek Plant or Loading Terminal.\n\nBased on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptor for the Loading Terminal but not the Plant.   In addition, the Greasy Creek Plant and Loading Terminal are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM). Therefore, the Greasy Creek Plant is classified a Program 1 process and Loading Terminal a Program 3 process under the Accident Release Program.\n\nC.\tOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.\tWorst-Case Releases\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nThe endpoint for a worst-case scenario (WCS) release of a flammable substance is a 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion.  The Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Greasy Creek Plant is from a release of methane with an endpoint 1 psi overpressure distance of 0.31 miles.  The worst-case release for the propane Loading Terminal is 0.49 miles. This is based on using the Environmental Protection"

It is assumed there was an unmitigated gas (methane) release at maximum pressure for 30 minutes.  The storage capacity of the two propane storage tanks at the Loading Terminal are 65,000 gallons each, which is limited to 80% or 52,000 gallons each by administrative controls.  It assumes the entire contents of one tank (52,000 gallons or 219,960 pounds) is released instantaneously and is involved in the vapor cloud explosion.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nThe Greasy Creek Plant and Loading Terminal do not have any toxic substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of worst-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\n 2.\tAlternative Releases\n\nAlternative releases scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including on-site damage.\n\nFlammable Substances\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for NGL's (Plant) and propane (Loading Terminal) as follows:  \n\nA two-inch valve on the de-methanizer tower (plant) and a two-inch valve on a 65,000 gallon, 250 psi, propane strorage tank (loading terminal) fails and releases contents undetected for a period of 30 minutes.  This volume released for each of 30,785 pounds then participates in a vapor cloud explosion resulting in a 1 psi overpressure endpoint distance of 0.25 miles.
