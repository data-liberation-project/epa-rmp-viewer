Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply designed and implemented to reduce the potential and consequence of accidental releases or emergencies.  The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level 3 Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The Frontier Cooling PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of Frontier Cooling, Inc. to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals have been achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations. \n\n\n\nFrontier Cooling also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. The Company is a non-responding facility however we have established an Emergency Action Plan within its California Hazardous Material Business Plan, and an Emergency Response Plan. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), Santa Barbara County Fire Department.  Frontier Cooling has ammonia technicians that are 1910.120(q) Hazardous Material Technician certified. Frontier Cooling relies on the Santa Barbara County Fire Department Station 21 for emergency response entry to the facility. The Facility can be controlled remotely for"

It is a vegetable and strawberry cooling and shipping facility which operates 12 months per year. The facility provides refrigeration for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables and strawberries; and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage.  The facility peak season occurs in the months of February through December.    Scheduled maintenance is performed primarily in the winter months.    \n\n\n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, Compressors, Evaporative Condensers, Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  The pressure coolers are used to pre-cool agricultural products; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage section of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 and CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.  Frontier Cooling strives to make the PSM Program an integral part of daily Plant operation.  Other safety programs are also integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.\n\n\n\nFrontier Cooling is the company that maintains th"

It has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation.  The company maintains the refrigeration equipment through a comprehensive Testing, Inspection, and Preventative Maintenance (T/I/PM) Program. The goal of the T/I/PM Program is to operate the refrigeration system safely, and efficiently. The goal is to  minimize breakdowns and catch problems before they pose significant risk to health and safety.  Through this regular routine of test, inspect, carry out scheduled preventative maintenance, Frontier Cooling has reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\n\n\nFrontier Cooling actively encourages training and continuing education of its management, operators, and mechanics.  Operators, and mechanics, only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified by training.\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nSince occupying the facility in 1979, Frontier Cooling has made continuous improvements to the facility and ammonia refrigeration equipment.  Improvements include, but are not limited to:  \n\n?    Self-closing valves were installed as a permissive for oil drain flow\n\n?    Seismic improvements\n\n?    Ammonia/water diffusion system\n\n?    Automated controls and notification system that communicates refrigeration system out-of tolerance parameters through text messaging to management, and staff for early warning and appropriate action.\n\n?    Ammonia detectors and alarms\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Frontier Cooling, Inc.:\n\n\n\n?
