      "SummaryText": "2021 Risk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nThe Equistar Chemicals Clinton Complex is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  The Risk Management Program at the Clinton Complex helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner.  This program is only one component of the safety program at the plant. It is the policy of Equistar to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations, and to act responsibly in the prevention of accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals.  The plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.  \r\n \r\nAn Equistar Chemical, L.P. Risk Management Plan has been created to provide a management system for implementing the Rule at covered corporate sites. \r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program for this site is the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, which has been implemented and is in effect. Auxiliary programs such as Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures and Storm water Pollution Prevention Plan are in place and effective.  The Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures procedure establishes the proper course of action in the event of the discharge of a hazardous substance or oil.  Additionally, preventive measures and precautions pertaining to specific hazardous substances handled and stored at Equistar are described.\r\n\r\nThe Equistar Clinton Complex consists of the following processes that are covered by this Rule:  Ethylene, and High- and Low-Density Polyethylene production. Vinyl Acetate Monomer, where listed, is regulated for toxicity, all other materials are regulated for flammability per the Risk Management regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Ethylene production process has the following toxic or flammable materials and mixtures for t"

Measures to prevent the release of flammables are centered on complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  Using the standards of OSHA PSM and American Petroleum Institute (API), flammables handlers have designed their equipment and procedures to minimize the risk of a release.  General preventive measures that are strictly followed to minimize the risk of releases are described below.\r\n\r\n-A complete, in-depth process hazard analysis is completed every five years by qualified personnel as specified by OSHA's PSM standard.\r\n\r\n-Operating procedures are used for directing and training the operators who are requalified every three years.\r\n\r\n-Operators, maintenance, and contractor personnel working with or close to related equipment are trained and qualified to handle it safely.\r\n\r\n-All mechanical work plans are reviewed using critical-service work permits to assu"

In some cases, gas detection alarms are used and will quickly identify a leak.\r\n\r\n-Automatic shut-off valves for shutting down the unloading process can be activated by low unloading pressure, leak detection, and manually from different plant locations.\r\n\r\n-Flammable unloading station can be isolated from other operations to reduce exposure to any fires or other accidents.\r\n\r\n-Water deluge systems can be used to displace flammable gas vapors if a leak should occur.  Also water deluge systems are used to cool vessels and pipelines during a fire situation.\r\n\r\n-Critical processes can be computer controlled to ensure continuous monitoring of all operating parameters and immediate shutdown of the production units.\r\n\r\n-Flammable gases are stored under two types of conditions.  One is under high pressure at ambient temperature and the other is low-pressure and low temperature.  High-pressure tanks are constructed with over one inch thick steel walls.

All tanks both high and low pressure are inspected on risk based timetables.\r\n\r\n-Flammable gas sensors are located strategically in the plant to provide advance warning of even low levels of flammable gases in the air.\r\n\r\n-Emergency systems are designed to quickly control leaks i"

The facility investigates every incident to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  There has not been a qualifying accident in the five years prior to this resubmission. \r\n\r\nA central corporate emergency response program policy exists with attachments as necessary to address the needs of the particular site.  This policy generally conforms to the elements of the Emergency Response Procedure.  The Clinton Plant has an emergency response team on each shift, available 24 hours per day, to respond and initiate response actions to contain, control, and if possible mitigate the release.  This team has access to on-site emergency equipment, which are appropriate for the anticipated emergency situations and capabilities of Equistar personnel.  Quarterly drills are conducted within the plant to assess and evaluate the emergency response effort at the Clinton Plant.  This could include accountability drills with personnel, evacuation drills, tabletop drills, or drills for the emergency crew only.  Annual drills are done in which outside agencies such as the Clinton Fire Dept. can participate as well.  If assistance is required during an emergency response, external emergency response could be activated to provide additional resources as necessary.  The Clinton Plant emergency response procedure has been communicated to the Local Emergency Planning Commission, Fire Department and Law Enforcement.\r\n\r\nThe following listed activities are some of the evergreen efforts"
