Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility is a chemical distribution warehouse.  The regulated substances arrive by via rail car (Pentane) and tank truck wagon (Isopentane). Isopentane is stored in an above-ground storage tank, is repackaged into drums, is transferred to storage, and subsequently loaded for shipment.  Isopentane is transfered directly to drums, is transferred for storage and is subsequently loaded for shipment.  The regulated substances handled are pentane and Isopentane.  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashdist.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario is to assume that the entire contents of the l"

Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario for pentane could potentially affect offsite industrial and commercial receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The worst-case release scenario for isopentane produces a lower endpoint distance than for pentane.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenario.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenario for pentane would only impact offsite industrial and commercial receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.  The alternative release scenario for isopentane produces a lower endpoint distance than that for pentane.\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment in"

Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response actions.  This facility regularly invites the local fire department and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plant and gain familiarity with our operations.  This facility has a written emergency preparedness plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: \n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews.  We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.  Ashland is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible CareSM Initiative Management Code on Process Safety."
