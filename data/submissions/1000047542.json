McCoy, (Marion County), FL 32209.  The FM Meat facility has over the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is a regulated highly hazardous chemical per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 40 CFR-68 RMP and OSHA 29CFR 1910-119PSM.  FM Meat has a unified Risk Management Program (RMP) as well as OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program that are presented in this plan.  The Plant first received ammonia in November 2013 and had developed and implemented this plan before delivery of the ammonia.  \n\n\n\n1.1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES (a)  \n\nFM Meat's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the EPA, RMP and OSHA's PSM program.  \n\n\n\n1.1.1.  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (a)(1)  \n\nFM Meat has a management system in place which is led by the FM Meat's Plant Manager, who oversees the implementation and on-going use of PSM/RMP elements.  This program, along with other facility-specific policies, eliminates and/or reduces the likelihood of an ammonia release at the facility.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plant's Process Safety Information.  \n\n\n\n1.1.2.  PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 3 (a)(2)  \n\nFM Meat maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of our prevention program.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 3-listed 12 elements, as well as PSM elements needed to implement the program.  These are maintained in the FM Meat plant Document Management System (DMS).  The unified PSM/RMP program was implemented in November, 2013 prior to receipt of the maximum inventory above the 10,000-pound threshold.  \n\n\n\n1.2."

Anhydrous ammonia is used as part of the refrigeration process.  \n\n\n\n1.2.1.  SITE DESCRIPTION (B)(1)  \n\nThe site is owned and operated by FM Meat Products Limited Partnership (FM Meat) The site is located at 19789 CR 315, Ft.  McCoy, FL.  The Plant includes a separate ammonia operation storage room and control room system.  The boundaries of the ammonia system subject to PSM/RMP regulation include the bulk ammonia storage and feed control rooms and the associated coolers and freezer evaporation units located throughout the plant, as well as the vent makeup and exhaust systems.  Ammonia flows from the compressor room to numerous refrigerator units and returns to the compressor room where it is compressed and then cooled and liquefied for further use in the roof-mounted condenser.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.  \n\n\n\n1.2.2.  REGULATED SUBSTANCE (b)(2)  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 10,000 pound EPA and OSHA threshold quantity.  FM Meat's ammonia system was installed as part of the process of supplying plant refrigeration.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ammonia is stored in a receiver and distributed to the refrigerator process control systems.  Anhydrous ammonia is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Ammonia's formula is NH3.  The OSHA PEL is 50 ppm.  It is flammable and is a gas at standard conditions.  Ammonia is liquefied by compression. \n\n&#8195;\n\n \n\n1.3.

The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario.\"  Results are depicted on an aerial map attached to the RMP*eSubmit.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the...shall assume that the entire maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes due to an unspecified failure\".  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.\"  Atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\" The EPA specified endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/l.  This endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distances was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"  \n\n\n\n1.3.1.  WORST CASE (c)(1)  \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions outlined in RMP-Comp.  Results demonstrate a distance to the toxic endpoint is in the PSI.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is in the submittal with population.  \n\n\n\n1.3.2.  ALTERNATIVE CASE (c)(2)  \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of a pipe or valve in the ammonia system.  This failure was defined during the recent Process Hazards Analysis.  This failure is equal to creating a 1/16-inch diameter hole in a pi"

An overview of the generally written programs is listed below.  FM Meat has detailed process safety information on all of its refrigeration operations.  The plant document maintenance system is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  Training and on-the-job experience is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used as well as first aid and emergency response to a release.  Maintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment.  Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the "

Ammonia-Specific Policies-Procedures  \n\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the ammonia specific program.  These include:  Specific procedures for the operation of the ammonia process as outlined below.  Completion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the ammonia system was conducted in November, 2013 for the new equipment installation.  Specific emergency response procedures for ammonia releases as outlined below under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures.  See the appendix of the Emergency Response Program book for specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and operations level leak repair for ammonia.  Finally, the details of the facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the ammonia system.  \n\n\n\n1.4.2.2.  Facility Design  \n\nThere is an ammonia storage process area: the compressor room.  Liquefied ammonia under high pressure is supplied via a pipe network to numerous refrigeration and freezer systems.  The high pressure ammonia evaporates to a gas in the refrigeration or freezer systems.  This ammonia gas is then drawn back into compressor and condensers located in and above the compressor room.  The gas is re-liquefied by the condensers and flows back to receivers and is fed to the suction "

The plant and support equipment of the ammonia compressor room and control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The building is equipped with an ambient ventilation area.  It has a fan ventilation system, which is used during ammonia receiver charging operations.  The room is also equipped with an ammonia monitor alarm and the system has an emergency shut down located in the adjacent control room area.  \n\n\n\n1.4.2.3.  Equipment Design  \n\nThere are several types of ammonia pipe systems, high and medium pressure liquid supply lines and medium and low pressure vapor return lines.  All the pressure ammonia piping system is made of ammonia compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These are rated to 2,500 psig.  The typical pressure of the ammonia in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a substantive safety factor.  This system is extensive, leading from the ammonia compressor room to each of the individual refrigerator or freezer units.  The medium and low pressure system operates under a positive pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also ammonia compatible.  Ammonia from the freezers returns at six psig and ammonia from the refrigeration units retunes at 20 psig.  The high pressure system is designed using schedule 80 seamless pipe and fittings designed 2,500 psig giving it a large safety factor over the typical positive pressure in the high pressure system.  The low pressure system uses schedule 40 pipe and fittings and is rated from 450 to 1.000 psig.  The low pressure system operates at 6 psig for freezer return lines and 20 psig for refrigeration return lines.  There are four ammonia monitors which detect the presence of ammonia in the compressor room storage area and vent relief stack from the ammonia system.  The alarm system not only ala"

The entire ammonia system is monitored and is sent to a wireless system that enables staff to be in constant communication with the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\n\n\n1.5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (e)  \n\nThere have been zero EPA recorded accidents in the past five years as this was written prior to plant startup.  \n\n\n\n1.6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM (f)  \n\nEmergency response procedures contain the Plant Emergency Response Policy and are coordinated with the Marion County (Emergency Response Plan) and the LEPC.  The plan includes an emergency response \"decision tree\" and a notification plan.  The Plant also has site-specific emergency actions defined in the plants operating procedures.  Emergency response drills and evacuation drills are conducted by the Maintenance and Operations departments.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.  The emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Plant Wide Safety Committee and the Marion County City Fire/Rescue Stations.  The plant coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Marion County Fire Department HazMat team.  All are located in Marion County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and plant physician.  In addition to the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the FM Meat plant.  The Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to an ammonia spill (release).  The plan includes training of all ammonia-area operators.  The primary response team includes the Marion County Fire and Rescue, as well as the Marion County Haz Mat Team.  All of these respond to severe ammonia leak situations.  Actions "

McCoy Fire Rescue and the Police and County Emergency Management Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.  \n\n\n\n1.6.1.  PERSONNEL (f)(1)  \n\nPersonnel are the key resource of the FM Meat prevention program.  Plant employees or contractors make up the operators' maintenance and emergency response teams.  FM Meat fosters a high level of involvement in every aspect of the ammonia system operation.  RMP safety teams developed the operation procedures; hazard evaluations; Process Hazards Analysis; and on-going training of the operators and other ammonia involved staff.  \n\n \n\n1.7.  CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY (g)  \n\nChanges to improve safety (recommended actions) were identified in the recent internal safety, tour and audit of the RMP program to meet requirements of the Process Safety Management/Risk Management Prevention Programs.  These recommended actions have now been evaluated and implemented as required.  A Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on November 6, 2013 to review the RMP program.  The key safety action items were completed including submission of the RMP e*Submit to the EPA.  See the \"Update\" Section 6 of that report.  FM Meat continually reviews implemented operating procedures for potential safety improvements for all of its operations.  Currently, the FM Meat management team and process safety team are reviewing potential of the existing design of the ammonia operations to make the system even safer to prevent a release and minimize consequences in the event of a release of ammonia.  \n\n\n\n"
