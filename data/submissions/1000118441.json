      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0\tRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Chemline facility has comprehensive safety and process training programs to reduce the risk of accidental releases and emergencies.  Should a release or emergency occur, Chemline has implemented an Emergency Action and Contingency Plan (EACP) as well as coordination with outside agencies, such as the St. Louis City LEPC and St. Louis City Fire Department, to ensure there is emergency response coverage 24 hours \u0096 7 days per week.\n\n\n2.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAt this location, Chemline manufactures and produces polyurethane and polyurea coatings as well as rigid and flexible polyurethane foams.  The NAICS code for the primary process at the facility is 325211, Plastics Material and Resin Manufacturing.\n\nChemline has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68:  Toluene Diisocyanate (CAS No. 26471-62-5) contained in various raw materials and stored in 55-gallon drums.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) is used as a reactant in the production of the coatings and foams.\n\nThe TDI threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of TDI stored on-site is approximately 73,000 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to the Chemline plant in St. Louis, MO.\n\n\n3.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nChemline is not subject to the OSHA PSM program for TDI or other chemical processes.  The processing of TDI at the facility falls under the RMP Program Level 2 prevention program. \n\nThere are several aspects of the TDI prevention program that are key:\n\n1. \tArea TDI monitors are strategically placed to allow for prompt detection, shutdown and emergency response if a leak occurs.\n2. \tTDI drums are stored in several different areas of the facility to reduce the amount that could be released if an incident were to occur in any one area.  \n3.  \tThe plant maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness o"

      "SummaryText": "f operating procedures.\n\n\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of the facility\u0092s accident history includes the following range of dates:  November 26, 2019 \u0096 January 2, 2024. Within this timeframe, there have been no accidental releases applicable to the criteria under 40 CFR 68.42(a).\n\n\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe employees of Chemline will not respond to releases of TDI at the facility.  The facility has developed an EACP to address all types of emergencies which could occur at the facility.  The plan includes key management personnel and their roles along with critical phone numbers.  Each type of emergency identified lists actions to be taken along with evacuation procedures.  The facility is included in St. Louis City LEPC\u0092s community emergency response plan. The St. Louis City Fire Department will be contacted along with a contracted spill response company if emergency response is needed.  The closest Fire Department Engine Company is located one block away from the facility, and regular walk-through tours are coordinated with crew members to familiarize them with the layout, access points, and key chemical process/storage areas of the facility.\n\n6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility is in the process of installing a new TDI process which will utilize storage tanks within containment structures, closed piping systems, automation, and safety devices such as alarms and interlocks for process control and mitigation.  This RMP will be updated and resubmitted when this change goes into effect."
