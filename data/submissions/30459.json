The Emergency Response Plan \n(Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was\ndesigned to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.  To save lives.\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.  To protect the environment.\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and \nMitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation.  \nThis manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe AmeriCold Logistics Plant #80549 facility is located at 525 S. Kilroy Road in Turlock, California.  The facility is \nSituated  approximately one-third mile south of west Main Street and one-half mile west of Highway 99.  The\nimmediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas  to all sides\n\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as vegetables, and poultry.  The facility operates the ammonia\nrefrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these food products.  The facility was originally \nbuilt in 1985. The facility currently covers approximately 19.5 acres.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses ammonia for cold storage rooms and process equipment, the ammonia inventory exceedes the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention.  The majority of the system is located in the engine room including three low pressure receivers, the compressors, the sub cooler, and the purger. The pilot receiver, the high pressure receiver, the heat exchangers, and the condensers are mounted outside the engine room and all evaporative are located in their"

HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\nDeleted per Regulation\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\nDeleted per Regulation\n\nD. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n     STEPS\n\nThe facility operates In accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines\nand standards including the following:\n\n\u00a8 IIAR Bulletin 107, Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Maidng Ammonia Refrigeration \n       Tie-ins \n\u00a8 IIAR Bulletin 109, Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia Refrigeration System \n\u00a8 IIAR, A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\nIn addition, the AmeriCold Logistics Plant #80549 has implemented a Process Safety Management program for\ncompliance with the Cal-OSHA regulation.\n\nE. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP reportable releases of ammonia at this facility over the last five years \n\nF. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility.\n\n1.      In the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will Immediately go to the nearest public address system and announce: ATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - THERE IS AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION). A supervisor in the area will determine whether or not the building must be evacuated.\n\n2. If the building is to be evacuated, the Supervisor will announce over the public address system:\nATTENTION IN THE WAREHOUSE - EVACUATE THE BUILDING.  WE HAVE AN AMMONIA LEAK IN (GIVE LOCATION).  WALK ! DO NOT RUN!\n\n3.      The Supervisor on duty will immediately (upon hearing the alarm) call 911 to report the leak and give the address of the facility.  He or she will then evacuate the building.\n\n4.\tEmployees will begin exiting  the building as per the published evacuation plan, and report to the proper area outside the building for a head count."

After a complete head count, each Supervisor will report the results of the head count to the person in charge of the plant. The person in charge of the plant will give the approximate working area for any persons not accounted for to the Fire Chief.\n\n7.    When the alarm is over, the Fire Department will determine the extent of the damage, the clean-up                  \n          procedure and whether or not the shift can be continued.\n\n8. Notify the Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources, Hazardous Materials Division. The following information should be relayed  to the County.\n\n\u00a8 Address of the plant.\n\u00a8 Callers name and name of the company.\n\u00a8 Name of the hazardous material released.\n\u00a8 Time of the release.\n\u00a8 Quantity of hazardous chemical released\n\n 9.    If more than 100 pounds of ammonia is released, the National Response Center should be notified.\n\n   10.    Within 48 hours, a complete investigation must be performed and all regulations and requirement of Process   \n       Safety Management must be met.\n\n 11.    Within 30 days of the release, the Emergency Release Follow-up Notice Reporting Form must be completed and sent to the Chemical Emergency Planning and Response Center (CEPRC) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in Sacramento.\n\n G. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n         There were several recommendations resulting from the review of the PSM/RMP document including recommendations from the Process Hazard Analysis and Off-Site Consequence Analysis studies. These Teams made several procedural/managerial recommendations to improve safety at the facility. These recommendations were included in a management plan and were addressed."
