SWU is a member owned, non-profit corporation organized to provide water and wastewater service to its members located in southern Okaloosa dn southern Walton Counties.  SWU is committed to operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable OSHA, EPA, and FDEP requirements.\n\nThe facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable rules and regulations.  SWU originally developed this Risk Management Plan on 6/8/2004.  This RMP was reviewed, corrected, and re-submitted on 3/31/2009.  \n\nThe facility is currently undergoing construction which will change the method of disinfection from chlorine to a hypochlorite (bleach) system.  Construction is scheduled for completion by December, 2009.  Upon completion, this RMP will be removed.\n\nProcess Description:  The facility is designed for the treatment of wastewater from the SWU wastewater collection system.  The facility uses chlorine for wastewater disinfection.  Chlorine is delivered to the facility via truck and stored in silver colored one ton and 150 pound cylinders.  These containers are stored and used on a chlorine dock located just east of the main office building at the facility.  The maximum intended inventory of chlorine is 6,000 lbs in one-ton and 150 pound cylinders.\n\nTo facilitate the chlorination process, two (2) one-ton cylinders are simultaneously connected to a split manifold.  Only one (1) container is active at any given time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has an aggressive accidental release program that is based upon a foundation of employee awareness and proactive system maintenance.\n\nFive Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases at the Facility in the last five (5) years prior to the date of this Plan.\n\nEmergency Response Program:  The facility has en Emergency Response "

This plan has been communicated to the South Walton Fire District.  It is the policy of SWU that its personnel are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a chlorine release.  These individuals have been trained to initiate an emergency response by notifying the South Walton Fire District.  They would take no further action beyond notifying the authorities of the release.\n\nThus it is the policy of SWU that the facility employees dial 911 in the event of a release emergency and allow the local Hazardous Materials Response Team to mitigate the release conditions."
