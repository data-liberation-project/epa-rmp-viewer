      "SummaryText": "Plan that defines the sequence of actions taken by facility employees in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.  This plan has been communicated to the South Walton Fire District.  It is the policy of SWU that its personnel are trained to the First Responder Awareness Level.  These are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a chlorine release.  These individuals have been trained to initiate an emergency response by notifying the South Walton Fire District.  They would take no further action beyond notifying the authorities of the release.\n\nThus it is the policy of SWU that the facility employees dial 911 in the event of a release emergency and allow the local Hazardous Materials Response Team to mitigate the release conditions."
