These systems are evergreen and are in a continuous state of improvement, usually through many small improvement steps.  Some examples are the implementation of recommendations from our hazard reviews and incident investigations.  Other examples are the improvement steps that result from our reviews of operating and mechanical procedures systems, which are tightly integrated with our training programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nRMP COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMUNITY DIALOGUE\r\n\r\nMBPP views RMP as an opportunity to build onto existing community outreach programs and open new and continuing dialogue with our neighbors.  Our communications goal is to go beyond the requirements defined in the RMP rule, and the RMP rule is one mechanism to educate and inform the Mont Belvieu community about the safety measures in place and the close working relationship we have with the local mutual aid infrastructure (MAMB), Mont Belvieu Police, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)."

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, MBPP has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered by the Safety, Security, Health, Environmental, and Emergency Response Section and include informing and/or training of affected personnel.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for MBPP is coordinated with the Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB) and Chambers County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  The committee meets periodically, including local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  MBPP has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., City of Mont Belvieu Police Dept).

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nMBPP promptly investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a personal injury, gas release, fire/explosion, major property damage, or environmental loss.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to MBPP management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features; procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, operations technicians periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understands the concepts.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nMBPP uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

As previously mentioned, OIMS has been deemed equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\r\n\r\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this Risk Management Plan.
