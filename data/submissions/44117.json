Their design also allows the equipment connected to the gas turbine to produce any combination of electricity, steam or chilled water while the gas turbine is in operation.  Steam absorption chillers utilize steam produced by the trigeneration systems in the summer.\n\nThe efficiency improvements of the integrated facility result in substantial economic and environmental benefits.  By using the same fuel twice to produce electricity and other energy products and maximizing the use of all the possible energy from the fuel, the facility is able to achieve fuel conversion efficiencies of 91%.  Operational savings of $1 million per year are projected over the life of the project.  Additionally, emissions of CO2 are reduced annually by 24, 327 tons, SOx by 126 tons annually, and NOx by 59 tons annually when compared to the separate production of these same energy products (steam, cooling, and electricity) by conventional means.  By increased efficiency in the cooling process and use of ammonia as a refrigerating agent, 6,500 refrigeration tons of potential ozone depleting refrigerant (CFCs and HCFCs) has been displaced.\n\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration System\n\nTrigen-Peoples uses pressurized liquid anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for portions of its district cooling system.  The ammonia is used to cool a chilled water system, which in turn is distributed and cools re-circulated air systems.  Trigen-Peoples\u00bf ammonia system contains approximately 28,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia (based on latest re-charging records.)\n\nAt ambient temperature and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritating odor.  Ammonia is highly soluble in water.  Ammonia is the third highest-volume chemical produced in the United States, with eighty percent of the ammonia produced used in the manufacture of fertilizers.  The EPA defined toxic endpoint for ammonia is 0.14 mg/L (approximately 200 ppm).  OSHA\u00bfs Imme"

A small ammonia leak in the room is immediately detected by area personnel (or ammonia sensors  and promptly investigated.  Ammonia equipment located on the roof of the facility is physically inspected three times a day.\n\nTrigen-Peoples also utilizes ammonia sensors located throughout the ammonia equipment areas and ventilation air stream.  This system is linked with the computer-control system.  If a sensor detects an ammonia leak, a series of alarms will activate, alerting the operator not only to the situation but its severity.  It also alerts the operator to a changing situation.  Upon detection of an ammonia concentration equal or greater than 250 ppm, the system will automatically shut down all equipment in the central power plant (not just the ammonia system equipment) and activate a mandatory evacuation of all non-responding personnel.  The ventilation system design mitigates the potential impact of an ammonia release on the public and the environment by dilution, increased atmospheric mixing and the elevated release point.\n\nIn the event of a major release, Trigen-Peoples would promptly link with the Chicago Fire Department for removal of the entire ammonia inventory or isolated sections of ammonia inventory.  This system is called the \u00bffireman\u00bfs dump.\u00bf  The ammonia is mixed with water and discharged to the sewer system.  The ammonia/water discharge ultimately enters the city\u00bfs wastewater systems in which ammonia will not adversely impact the environment.

Problems identified during equipment inspections are addressed immediately.  The preventative maintenance program includes regularly scheduled maintenance activities such as equipment testing, clearance checks, vibration checks, periodic overhauls, vessel and pipe inspections and certifications, and lubrication oil and refrigerant quality testing.\n\nAll ammonia-related activities (operations, maintenance, and construction) are conducted under the aegis of the General Manager.  The Plan and Controls engineer coordinates all facility activity.  Direct involvement of the chief Engineer and the Assistant Chief Engineer (Safety Officer) is found in all ammonia-related activities and personnel utilize facility specific operation procedures in their operation and maintenance of the ammonia equipment.\n\nLeaks\n\nEvery effort is made to prevent ammonia leaks.  However, the possibility of a leak does exist and thus Trigen-Peoples has developed an Emergency Ammonia Leak response plan.  Trigen personnel are thoroughly trained in ammonia response and have the necessary equipment maintained on-site to respond immediately and effectively to an ammonia release.  Employees undergo initial response training and yearly refresher course that include practice response scenarios utilizing the required protective equipment under adverse conditions.  Personnel safety is of primary importance.  An important component of the response plan is, if necessary, to shut down all equipment and await backup personnel before attempting to enter a potentially unsafe area.  Essentially, production is sacrificed in order to achieve safety.\n\nThe key to leak mitigation is the ability to identify leaks as early in their development as possible.

Trigen uses its expertise in thermal engineering and proprietary cogeneration processes to convert fuel to various forms of thermal energy and electricity at more efficient conversion rates than conventional processes.  Trigen combines heat and power generation, producing electricity as a by-product, for use in its facilities and for sale to customers.  The Corporation serves more than 1,500 customer facilities with energy produced at 45 plants in 30 locations, including industrial plants, electric utilities, commercial and office buildings, government buildings, colleges and universities, hospitals, residential complexes and hotels.
