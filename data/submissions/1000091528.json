The facility sits on 62 acres of agricultural land that was purchased for the construction of an ammonium sulfate fertilizer and soil nutrient manufacturing facility.  \r\n\r\nAt the Anuvia Zellwood facility, only the operations related to the handling and consumption of anhydrous ammonia is covered by the RMP Program.  NOTE:  This site maintains amounts of anhydrous ammonia greater than the 10,000 pound RMP threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nStarting with the ammonia truck unloading, the RMP Covered Process includes the 2 - 17,500 gallon ammonia storage tanks, the ammonia truck transfer pumping unit, the ammonia pump set (PU-1518 and PU-1519), the ammonia flow control skid, Ammonia vaporizer (VP-1703), and all ammonia transfer piping and instruments.  Consult the Ammonia Equipment (RMP Equipment) List for details. \r\n\r\nThis facility is regulated as Program 3 site of the EPA RMP regulations 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n\r\nOffsite consequence analysis has been performed for the Ammonia process using EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis.  The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) has been identified as 3.2 miles and the Alternate Case Scenario (ACS) has been identified as 0.2 miles.  The WCS and ACS are included with the Risk Management Program submitted to the RMP*eSubmit.  A copy of this submittal is kept in the Plant Managers Office.  Off site Consequence Analysis will be updated any time a process change will increase the affect of a Worst Case release.  See 40 CFR Part 68 for details on RMP Plan revisions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention:\r\nThe Anuvia Plant has taken numerous precautionary and prevention steps to minimize potential failures of the ammonia system.  Redundant safety systems, vapor monitoring equipment, security procedures, mechanical integrity inspections, shutdown and water spray system.  The Plant is manned 24 hours per"

Any changes to the system will be tracked and documented in accordance with the Management of Change procedures under OSHA Process Safety Management standard.\r\n\r\nFive Year accident History:\r\nSince this facility is being built and is a new process, there have not been any accidents in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan has been developed by Anuvia to protect human health and the environment in the event of an unintended release of hazardous materials, personal injury or property damage accidents, fire, natural Events (Tornados, Hurricanes, Floods, etc.) and/or explosion.  The plan and procedures are formalized to include an assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, provide record keeping procedures of emergency incidents, and describe the reporting of emergency incidents to regulatory agencies.  This plan also formalizes the arrangements with local police, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response personnel in case of an emergency event.  The Emergency Response Plan also describes the actions that facility personnel must take in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned, sudden, or non-sudden release of hazardous materials or hazardous materials constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility. The Plan also describes the available emergency equipment, training, evacuation and shelter in place procedures, and emergency shutdown procedures.  A copy of this plan is available to each employee and is intended to meet the mandates of the applicable regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over this facility.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\nSince the Anuvia facility is a new manufacturing site, all available safety systems and Best Manufacturing Practices were implemented prior to and during construction.  Any future safety, control equipment, technology organizational changes or mitigation will be addressed usi"
