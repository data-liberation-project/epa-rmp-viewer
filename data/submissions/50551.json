The ammonia detection systems have two setpoints.  At the first setpoint, local horns and strobes are activated to alert operators and employees to the situation.  At the second setpoint, the detection system will stop liquid supply (Process and Cold Storage Areas) or liquid feed (Engine Rooms).\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased upon the Patterson Frozen Food Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation Report (dated 05/10/2004), there has been one reportable release of ammonia at the facility over the past five years (April 1999 - April 2004):\n\nIn April 2004, a failed diaphragm on a thermal expansion valve resulted in the release of a small quantity of liquid ammonia in one of the cooler rooms.  An ammonia sensor (setpoint: 35ppm) initiated a horn and strobe light outside of the room which alerted operators to the situation.  The operators then attempted to halt liquid supply to the ammonia equipment by closing the main liquid supply king valve, but retained compressor operation in an effort to draw ammonia vapor from the refrigeration equipment.  The operators then proceeded to ventilate the room by using portable fans.\n\nThe Emergency Response Team donned SCBAs prior to entering the room.  The cause of the leak was identified and active mitigation was attempted.  This was accomplished by first closing the upstream valve and then closing the downstream valves.  When closing one of the downstream valves, one member of the Emergency Response Team received minor injuries when ammonia from the leak dripped onto his forearm.  The faulty diaphragm was replaced and the system was returned to service.  As a result of this incident, Patterson Vegetable Company now includes in Emergency Response Team Training that full body protection must be worn when responding to a chemical release.\n\nIn addition to the above, there have also been some minor"

This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00bf save lives;\n\u00bf minimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00bf protect the environment; and\n\u00bf minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Emergency Response Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn September 1994, the refrigeration systems were thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, Revalidations of the initial Process Hazard Analysis were performed in May 1999 and April 2004.  The 2004 PHA Revalidation consisted of a:\n\n\u00bf review of recommendations from the previous studies;\n\u00bf series of safety checklists; and\n\u00bf facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include the addition of cautionary signage and enhanced system shutdown features.  All recommendations resulting from the revalidation study are due to be completed by April 2005."

Patterson Frozen Food\u00bfs senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Patterson Vegetable Company\u00bfs safety and environmental policies are administered by the Regulatory Affairs Specialist.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Patterson Vegetable Company facility is located at 100 West Las Palmas Avenue in Patterson, California, which is adjacent to the CA-33 Highway.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in 1946 with several additions, renovations, and modifications occurring since that time.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.\n\nThe primary business of Patterson Vegetable Company is to package and store frozen vegetables.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains approximately 115,738 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance, in four ammonia refrigeration systems.  Each refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold warehousing.  Typical operating conditions range from 5 Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side of the system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION S"

      "SummaryText": "TEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n3) OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Patterson Vegetable Company to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia systems are operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia systems are in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Patterson Frozen Food 's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration systems have been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and t"
