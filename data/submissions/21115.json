The site occupies approximately 1,500 acres and has over 1200 employees on site. Production at the McIntosh site began in 1952 with 32 employees manufacturing one product.  Currently, the site produces approximately 250 products which include specialty chemicals that are additives and resins used in aerospace and industrial applications, optical brightners used in detergent, paper and textile industries, and chemicals used in household and farm products, such as herbicides, pesticides and insecticides.\n\nWith an injury rate 40 percent below the national average, the McIntosh site is a leader in safety.  In fact, employees at the site have worked one million safe hours (hours worked without an accident) 32 times since 1972.  The OSHA Star Designation program requires stringent inspections and an excellent safety and health program.  In 1989, the McIntosh site became the 64th industrial site out of five million in the U.S. to receive the coveted designation.  The site was re-certified as an OSHA Star site in 1997.\n\nThe line of products at McIntosh may vary in response to market demand.  Overall, there are three operating divisions at the McIntosh site.  These three divisions are the Additives Division, the Performance Polymers Division and the Consumer Care Division.  Below is a brief description of each production area at the site:\n\nThe Additives Area 1 is designed to produce Irgafos (process stabilizers used primarily as blend components) and Irganox (antioxidants).  In this Area, raw materials and solvents are fed to reactors.  The reaction mass undergoes additional processing steps such as stripping, crystallizi"

Solvents used in the process are recovered and reused.  One RMP-regulated substance exceeding the threshold quantity was identified in Area 1: Phosphorous trichloride at a maximum quantity of 80,000 lbs.\n\nThe Additives Area 7 is designed to produce Diazinon.  The process starts by burning hydrogen and chlorine to produce hydrochloric acid.  The gas is then cooled and fed continuously to both the oxypyrimidine process unit and an absorber, where 32% hydrochloric acid is made.  The oxypyrimidine is then reacted with raw materials to produce Diazinon.  Three RMP-regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 7: chlorine at a maximum quantity of 3,100 lbs., isobutyronitrile at a maximum quantity of 800,358 lbs., and a 28% ammonia solution at a maximum quantity of 166,316 lbs. \n\nThe Additives Area 14 is designed to produce two classes of products: Thioherbicides and methoxyherbicides.  The process involves reacting chlorotriazines with methyl mercaptan or methanol to make the final products.  Toluene is used in the process as a solvent to transfer the product that is then fed through a two stage stripping operation to remove the solvent.  The molten product is then crystallized, milled and packaged.  The only RMP regulated substance exceeding its threshold quantity identified in Area 14: methyl mercaptan at a maximum quantity of 480,983 lbs.\n\nThe Additives Area 17/18 is designed to produce various additives by diazotizing o-nitroaniline with sodium nitrite in an acidic medium.  The resulting diazonium salt is reacted with one of several substituted phenols.  The intermediate is then separated from the reaction mass and dissolved in a solvent before being reacted with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst to form the corresponding additive product.  The catalyst is then removed from the reaction mass and the solve"

No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 17/18.\n\nThe Additives Area 20 is a multi-product batch-processing unit that produces a variety of additives that are used in other finished products.  Some of the chemicals produced in Area 20 include light stabilizers, antioxidants, and oil additives.  Only one RMP regulated substance exceeding its threshold quantity was identified in Area 20: 64% solution of hydrazine hydrate at a maximum quantity of 52,450 lbs.\n\nThe Polymers Division (Area 12/19) produces specialty polymers and basic liquid resins.  Each product category covers many individual products manufactured from potentially different raw materials.  Only one RMP regulated substance exceeding its threshold quantity was identified in the polymers division: epichlorohydrin at a maximum quantity of 3,370,000 lbs. \n\nThe Consumer Care Area 2 produces a variety of surfactants and oleophenols in addition to sodium iodide solution.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 2.\n\nThe Consumer Care Area 8 produces fluorescent whitening agent (FWA) intermediates and paper dyes.  These are either further processed on site or sold.  The FWA intermediates and some of the paper dyes are produced from a para-nitro toluene base.  Many dyes are also formulated and/or repackaged, but not chemically produced in the Area.  Two RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 8: Ammonia at a maximum quantity of 127,540 lbs. and Oleum, 65% at a maximum quantity of 918,385 lbs.\n\nThe Consumer Care Area 10 primary task is to produce fluorescent whitening agents (FWA) that are used in various commercial products, such as paper, textiles, and detergents.

The final products are sold in liquid, solid or slurry forms.  Various additives are used to enhance product performance.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 10.\n\nThe Utilities Department controls all the boilers as well as the hydrogen storage and header system.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in the utilities area.\n\nA waste management facility (Area 15) also exists on site which includes an incinerator for hazardous waste as well as aboveground wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) that treats sanitary and process wastewater generated at the plant.  No RMP regulated substances exceeding their threshold quantities were identified in Area 15.\n\nThe first key element in the RMP regulations is that a facility must identify all processes that contain any RMP-regulated substances above their designated threshold quantities.\n\nThe second key element in the RMP regulations, is to determine program levels for the RMP-regulated processes.  These levels range from a Program 1 that imposes minimal requirements on a process to a Program 2 or 3 which require a much greater deal of effort.  The McIntosh site is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The site?s processes are also included in the nine SIC codes specified by the RMP rule.  Therefore, the facility has designated all of its processes to be in the Program 3 level of the RMP.\n\nThe third key element in the RMP regulations is that Program 3 facilities must conduct an offsite consequence analysis.  Ciba opted to use the EPA guidance manual mainly because it is more conservative than most commercial models. Ciba also used the toxic endpoint concentrations specified in the manual, which represent concentrations below those believed to cause serious health effects after thir"

This data was then confirmed using the EPA provided software RMP*COMP. \n\nUsing extremely conservative estimates of weather and release conditions, Ciba?s offsite consequence analysis indicated that a worst-case toxic release scenario could have an offsite impact.  This scenario was based on the failure of a railcar containing methyl mercaptan, which has a toxic end point concentration of 0.049 mg/liter.  The toxic end points specified for the regulated toxic substances are intended to be protective of the general public.  These end points are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one-half to one hour without any serious health effects.  To prevent such a catastrophe from occurring, Area 14 has a permanently installed emergency storage vessel, which can accommodate the material in case of a vessel failure and a deluge system  to minimize a release. It is important to note that the McIntosh site has safely handled methyl mercaptan for 29 years. Training, procedures, safety systems, and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to ensure we will continue to handle this and all materials safely.\n\nUtilizing the same EPA guidance manual, an alternative release scenario for methyl mercaptan was also developed that could have an offsite impact.  This alternative release scenario was based on a worst case scenario occurring on the drop tank vessel within the process unit. The same measures in place for the larger storage tanks and rail car also apply to this tank.\n\nAn alternative release scenario was also considered for each RMP-regulated toxic chemical on site.  The alternative release scenarios were based on process knowledge, accident history or the process hazard analysis conducted for the unit.\n\nThe phosphorus trichloride alternative release scenario was based on the assumption of a transfer hose failure during an unloading operation in Area 1.

The unloading operation is also monitored by a computer and by control room operator. Should a problem with the unloading occur, the tank trucks are equipped with an emergency cut off valve that can quickly be closed from the front of the truck.  Also, the unloading area is surrounded by a concrete dike that is large enough to hold the contents of an entire truckload of material. This diked area is equipped with a foam spray system that can be used to provide a protective barrier to prevent vapors from a spill from being released to the air. Procedures, training, safety systems and preventive maintenance programs are all in place to prevent spills, but should a spill occur, this unit  is well prepared to effectively respond.\n\nThe Chlorine alternative release scenario was based on the assumption that a chlorine pipe leak occurs in Area 7.  With an endpoint of 0.0087 mg/liter, this scenario could have an offsite impact. Chlorine is produced at an adjacent facility and is transfered though a 1.5 inch diameter pipe to Area 7.  The pipeline is divided into five zones by automatic valves. These valves will automatically close if there is a sudden pressure drop on the line which may indicate a leak. The entire length of the line is visually inspected twice a day and is inspected for corrosion annually. The pipeline is made of a thick wall pipe (schedule 80) and all joints are welded, not flanged. Also, a direct telephone line is in place between the Area 7 control room and the adjacent facility control room. \n\nThe isobutyronitrile alternative release scenario was based on the assumption that a transfer hose has failed in Area 7.

With a toxic endpoint of 0.011 mg/liter, this scenario can not have an offsite impact.  A 64% solution of hydrazine hydrate is stored in a stainless steel storage tank within a concrete dike. A scrubber is used to capture vapors during unloading operations.

Also, a second storage tank is always kept empty for emergency storage. \n\nThe epichlorohydrin alternative release scenario was based on the assumption that a valve was left open in the Polymers Area during the transfer of product from one vessel to another.  Epichlorohydrin has a toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/liter.  This scenario will not have an offsite impact.  Spill prevention measures in place for epichlorohydrin include computer automated systems, preventive maintenance programs, procedures and training.

This scenario will not have an offsite impact.  Spill prevention measures in place for oleum include the use of a double walled storage tank, redundant level instrumentation, preventive maintenance programs, scrubber system, and computer controls and interlocks. If a spill should occur, the storage area is located within a concrete dike to contain the spill, and a storage tank is always kept empty for emergency storage of oleum. A special neutralizing powder called Spill-X-A is also available to neutralize spills.\n\nAnother key element of the RMP regulations is to develop and submit a five-year accident history involving RMP-regulated substances.  Over the past five years, the Ciba McIntosh site has had two accidents involving RMP regulated substances. \n\nThe first accident occurred on June 1995 and involved spilling approximately 9000 lbs. of Epichlorohydrin from a storage vessel.  The accident resulted in 1 OSHA recordable injury of a Ciba employee.  Following this incident, Ciba upgraded the equipment that did not function as planned and revised the operating procedures to insure that employees and contractors are trained and fully understand the process operating procedures.\n\nThe second accident occurred on February 1997 and involved a short span release of a methyl mercaptan, isopropanol and nitrogen mixture.  The release lasted less than a minute and resulted in 2 OSHA recordable injuries.  Since then, Ciba has revised its maintenance and training programs and revised the operating procedures to prevent such accidents from occurring.\n\nIn order to deal with potential accidents and emergencies, Ci"
