Medina, Ohio plant has never had an accident involving flammable propellants that resulted in injuries, property damage or environmental releases.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  In the event of an emergency involving flammable propellants, plant personnel will notify the Medina Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.  We have provided the fire department with our Emergency Response Plan and members of the fire department have inspected the plant.  In addition, Plasti-Kote has a contract with a qualified emergency response firm to aid in the cleanup of a release.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Plasti-Kote has an ongoing and continuing process to audit, update and review our manufacturing process for safety considerations. Based upon this review Plasti-Kote will further investigate changing the leak detection equipment in the tank farm."
