We are strongly committed to safety by maintaining comprehensive maintenance, prevention, and industrial safety programs that protect against any accidentla release or spill which may result in on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a mishap, an emergency response plan has been developed in cooperation with the Berkeley County Disaster Preparedness Agency, which serves to ensure the safety and well being of the community and the environment. Our emergency response program is based upon the recommendations by The Chlorine Institute, Inc. within the \"Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.\"\n\nFacility Description\n\nChlorine is stored on-site for use in the disinfection process for the treatment of wastewater prior to final discharge. Six 2,000-pound pressurized chlorine cylinders are located within an enclosed building south of the treatment ponds for use in the treatment process.  An additional six to eight 150-pound chlorine cylinders are stored on-site prior to transport to other facilities.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine storage area to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment failure.\n\nWithin the dechlorination process, four 2000-pound storage cylinders supply gaseous sulfur dioxide, that when mixed with the treated wastewater, facilitates the removal of any residual chlorine following the chlorination process.  An additional six to eight 150-pound cylinders are stored on-site prior to transport to other facilities.  The latest technology in process control systems are present in the chlorine storage area to minimize and prevent the impacts of any spillage, fire, explosion, or equipment"

      "SummaryText": " failure.\n\nAccident History\n\nThe Lower Berkeley Wastewater Treatment Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental release over the past 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred or were identified within the time period in question.  Since the facility has been in operation, no deaths or injuries have resulted from the accidental release, explosion, or fire involving this regulated substance.  Furthermore, no fish kills or other environmental impacts have resulted from an accident or spill incident at the Goose Creek, South Carolina facility.\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Berkeley County has calculated a worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario based on the EPA approved RMP*Comp modeling software.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Lower Berkeley WWTP has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR Pad 68.  The chlorination and dechlorination processes have been designed and constructed in accordance with The Chlorine Institute Standards, good engineering practices, and all applicable codes or standards.  Furthermore, the Prevention Program at the Lower Berkeley WWTP has been developed in accordance with the standards established with 29 CFR 1910.119. The prevention program consists of the elements as follows:\n\n1. Employee Participation \nEmployees at the Lower Berkeley WWTP are provided access to all elements of this Risk Management Plan for review and input.  Site management, whenever possible, involves employees in the development, revisions, review, and implementation of this plan.  Employees, knowledgeable in the specified processes, are included in any task group or team for their invaluable experience and input for developing a successful program to ensure the well being of co-workers, the community, and the environment.\n\n2.

Information includes the chemical hazards, operating procedures, and equipment design parameters.\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis \nThe What-if checklist hazard analysis method is utilized at the Goose Creek, South Carolina facility to identify and prevent any activity that may result in a release of a regulated substance.  A team of qualified personnel perform periodic reviews of operating procedures, equipment functions, and handling practices to identify potential hazards every three years, or in the event of any process or equipment change.  Any findings related to the hazard review is addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\n4. Operating Procedures \nWritten operating procedures addressing initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations have been developed to ensure the safe operation of the covered processes.\n\n5. Training \nA comprehensive training program provides employees the proper education to safely maintain and operate the chlorination or dechlorination processes.  New employees receive basic training in process operations and safety, followed by a supervised on-the-job training period.  Refresher training is provided to all employees at least every three years or as needed.\n\n6. Mechanical Integrity \nThe Berkeley County utilizes maintenance employees to regularly inspect and document the condition and functioning of all equipment associated with the covered processes.  Any inspections or maintenance operations are performed by qualified personnel with previous specialized training for accomplishing such tasks.  All deficiencies or equipment were identified during maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n7. Management of Change \nPrior to any modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials, or processing, the Lower Berkeley WWTP shall ensure the "
