Refresher training is conducted every three (3) years for operators and is a combination of CBT and one-to-one training. Safety training is a combination of CBT and classroom and is held annually for all required OSHA training. Emergency Response Training is held as required by the applicable regulation. Training records are maintained on the Training Department data base. The Operations Department in conjunction with the Training Department verifies that operators on the units are current with their required training. Maintenance training is conducted by the Training Department as either in-house or third-party training (i.e. certification of crane operators). Further, the Training Department provides specialized training such as forklift certification either in-house or by a third-party provider. Engineers and other salaried personnel are provided with third-party training to continue or advance their skills. Safety training is a combination of both CBT and classroom.

Collectively, these activities help prevent potential accidents that could be caused by equipment failure and / or human error. In addition to the accident prevention program activities, Alon has safety features on many units to help 1) contain / control a release, 2) quickly detect a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes: release detection, hydrocarbon detectors with alarms, hydrofluoric acid detectors with alarms, hydrogen sulfide detectors with alarms, personal hydrogen sulfide detectors worn while in the units, process relief devices that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases, valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated), emergency shutdown systems, curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases, redundant equipment and instrumentation, double seals on specific pumps, atmospheric relief devices, water curtain in the HF area, water cannons, deluge system on sphere 73, fire suppression and extinguishing systems, and trained emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn the past five years, Alon had one reportable RMP incident. On February 17, 2021 a fire started on the west end of the Alkylation Unit. The Emergency Response Team quickly responded by using water cannons and dry chemicals to put out the fire and contain the area. The fire resulted in significant property damage, but none resulted in human injuries, deaths or any off-site consequences. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Alon Refinery is continually seeking to improve the safety of the facility.

The refinery has standardized on the National Information Management System (NIMS) in order to be able to seamlessly integrate with outside responding agencies. As members of one or more of the refinery Emergency Response Teams (REDHATS), refinery personnel participate in classroom training, onsite training, offsite training, drills, and real incidents inside the refinery.

Incidents are reported in the plant data management system, and action items related to those incidents are also input and tracked in the data management system. Incidents are investigated at different levels depending on the severity of the incident. The refinery is currently using the 5-Why method of investigated near miss and minor incidents. The teams assigned to those investigations are supervisors and subject matter experts (SMEs) associated with the area where the incident occurred. Higher level events receive a root- cause type of investigation that is comprised of a team leader, representatives from the affected area, SMEs, and others as needed.\r\n\r\nTeam members include at least one member familiar with the covered process, a represented worker appropriate for the investigation, a contract employee if the incident involved the work of a contractor and others with appropriate technical knowledge and experience as needed to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.

The BSR accidental release prevention program includes all of the elements of both PSM and RMP regulations. Key to these prevention efforts is the knowledge of the chemicals and equipment used in the process units, the careful evaluation of and reduction of operating risks, and the proper operation, monitoring, upkeep and maintenance of equipment and systems. These ongoing efforts substantially reduce the likelihood of severe accidental release event (toxic or flammable) occurring at the BSR. The mitigation systems currently in place and the prompt response by experienced and qualified personnel would further limit the worst case or alternate scenarios to much less than the estimated impacted areas if they did occur. The following is more detailed information regarding our risk management and incident prevention program currently in place.\r\n\r\nThe Alon USA BSR Accidental Release Prevention Program includes the following elements:\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - All Alon USA Big Spring employees are involved in risk management efforts.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond quickly and effectively to control and mitigate the release. In an effort to reduce the risk of accidental releases from this facility it is the policy of the Alon USA Big Spring Refinery (BSR) to comply with the requirements of both 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Materials (PSM), and 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (a.k.a. Risk Management Program, or RMP), regulatory requirements. We have verified compliance with these important regulations.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe BSR is a 73,000 barrels per day crude oil refinery located in Big Spring, Texas with a Nelson Complexity of 10.5. BSR produces transportation fuels, solvents, finished asphalt, and Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG's). The refinery has more than the threshold quantity of several flammable substances and flammable mixtures and two toxic substance (hydrogen fluoride and anhydrous ammonia). Hydrogen Fluoride is used as a catalyst in the production of gasoline blend stock in the Alkylation Unit. Ammonia is used to reduce atmospheric emissions of Nitrogen Oxides from the boilers.\r\n\r\nIn 2022, the refinery reports thirteen (13) Program 3 RMP-regulated processes and seven (7) Program 1 RMP-regulated processes.
