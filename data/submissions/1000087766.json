The facility's overall approach to chemical safety is an integral part of the risk management program and the safe \"day-to- day\" operation procedures implemented at the facility. The program is modeled after five elements functioning in a continuous cycle to ensure the safety of the facility and the surrounding communities. The Risk Management program model is comprised of the following elements.\r\n1.\tRisk Identification\r\n2.\tRisk Analysis\r\n3.\tEmergency Response & Planning\r\n4.\tRisk Monitoring & Control\r\n5.\tContinuous Improvement\r\n\r\nSherre-Ann Wallace, Program Manager, is the person responsible for RMP (part 68) implementation. The program manager may delegate certain tasks and responsibilities associated with the RMP to other facility employees as necessary. The responsibilities of the manager, or designee, include:\r\no\tConduct regular risk review for the facility\r\no\tReview the status of all risk mitigation efforts\r\no\tIdentify and analyze any new risks\r\no\tIdentify steps to mitigate risks\r\no\tIdentify and rank most critical risks\r\no\tAssess the exposure and probability for the risk\r\no\tMaintain the project's risk list\r\no\tReport risk status to necessary key individuals and stakeholders\r\n\r\n9.1.1.\tRisk Identification\r\n\r\nDuring risk identification, potential sources of risk and potential risk events are developed. Each risk is then ranked or categorized, based on risk analysis. After identifying and categorizing the risk event, it is entered into the Risk Register. Risk identification is conducted at regularly defined intervals throughout the life of the facility and/or process. The known risks are identified immediately so proper response planning and monitoring can occur. All identified risks will be documented and entered into the Risk Register (an Excel spreadsheet), which is kept in a commonly accessible location. The Risk R"

The process will be reviewed and analyzed at regular intervals in conjunction with risk identification. The Risk Register will be updated, as necessary, to track additional potential risks as they are identified. During the risk analysis, the following information will be gathered and documented on the Risk Register:\r\n1.\tPotential Risk Event\r\n2.\tProbability of Occurrence (recorded as High-Medium-Low)\r\n3.\tImpact (recorded as High-Medium-Low)\r\n4.\tTrigger/Symptom - the risk trigger/symptom is the event that would need to happen in order for the potential outcome to occur. Risk triggers are usually expressed with some sort of qualifier. When the risk trigger/symptom occurs, the risk is no longer a risk, but has materialized into a problem/issue that needs resolution.\r\n5.\tResponse (recorded as Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept, Other)\r\n6.\tResponse/Mitigation/Contingency Plan\r\n\r\nAll identified risks will be documented and maintained on the Risk Register. Potential risks that currently exist at the facility/process that could result in a release of toxic chemicals include:\r\no\tEquipment failures\r\no\tEquipment leaks\r\no\tWeather events - Tornado, Hurricane\r\n\r\n9.1.3.\tEmergency Response & Planning\r\n\r\nWhen a risk is identified, the appropriate response is indicated for the risk. A customized mitigation and/or response plan is then developed and implemented to respond to the particular risk or emergency situation. The facility will function under SOP-920-SAF-191 Rev 3.0.\tFurther, the facility is covered under the Henry County EMA Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\n9.1.4.\tRisk Monitoring and Control\r\n\r\nRisk monitoring and control tracks and evaluates the performance of risk- handling actions against establ"

At this time, any new or additional identified risks not included on the risk register will be added.

Documentation is an integral part of risk monitoring and control. Documentation will include\r\n \r\nrisk review dates, any changes to the risk register, etc. Each regularly scheduled risk review and all monitoring and control activities will be documented on the Risk Register. A revision date for any changes made to the Risk Register must be recorded under Revision History of the register. The revision history will record each time the plan is updated and revised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9.2.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility implements measures, both technological and procedural, to ensure prevention of accidental release of regulated substances. Process controls have been designed into the process to prevent and/or minimize accidental releases of regulated substances. Regular monitoring and maintenance is performed on all equipment to ensure optimum operating conditions and minimize accidents.\r\n\r\n9.3.\tFive-Year Accident History\r\nThere has been no accidents in the last five year at this facility.\r\n\r\n9.4.\tEmergency Response Program\r\nThe facility has compiled an Emergency Response (ER) Plan, and has coordinated the ER plan with the Henry County EMA office.
