The result shows that offsite areas may be affected.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Analysis Summary\r\nA release of chlorine gas from a 1/4-inch diameter leak while the scrubber is either failed or ineffective is postulated.  This scenario represents a breach in the piping of the system with one of the vacuum regulators failing to close on loss of vacuum as designed.  This scenario represents the worst probable scenario leading to continuous chlorine release until the emergency response team takes action.  Since the entire system is located inside the Chlorination Building, the release rate was adjusted per EPA\u00bfs recommended formulations.  This scenario is postulated to last for one hour, assuming that self refrigeration would not take place to reduce the release rate.  It is assumed within one hour the operators would respond to a detector alarm and the emergency response team would limit the release rate by either stopping the flow or taking other actions.  The meteorological conditions specified in the regulation for alternative scenarios were used.  Similar to the worst case, RMP*Comp computer program was used to determine the maximum downwind distance to 3-ppm.  The downwind distance for this scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  Only a small area outside the facility may be affected by chlorine gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIRWD has a Process Safety Management program in place to manage the handling of chlorine and other regulated substances at all its sites.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are instituted to ensure safe practices are routinely employed at all District facilities and operations.

IRWD is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and its communities.  IRWD staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these useful chemicals.  These chemicals play an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIRWD has an Emergency Response Plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility. This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nKey elements of the Emergency Response Plan include:\r\n\r\n - A detailed emergency response action guide\r\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for the IRWD Emergency Response Team\r\n - Incident Command System (ICS) and unified command interface\r\n - ICS position descriptions including their responsibilities\r\n - Vicinity and evacuation maps\r\n - Detailed task-by-task plans for:\r\n     - Evacuation\r\n     - Fire in a process or non-process area\r\n     - Injuries\r\n     - Threats and civil disorder\r\n     - Wild land or adjacent property fire\r\n     - External events (e.g., earthquake)\r\n     - Potential imminent danger to personnel\r\n     - Chemical spill (e.g., caustic and chlorine)\r\n     - Chlorine release\r\n     - Offsite event involving a hazardous material\r\n\r\nIRWD has 15 employees who are specialists, trained and fully equipped to handle hazardous spill containment and cleanup. These employees train monthly and run drills twice a year. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency R"

The plan complies with the emergency response requirements of RMP and CalARP regulations and it is reviewed periodically to ensure that it contains up-to-date information.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Chlorination System at Irvine Ranch Water District's Rattlesnake Reservoir Facility has been upgraded. Chlorine is used for treatment of water flowing through the 30 in. Zone A, Irvine Lake Pipeline and 16in. Zone B Pipeline.  \r\n\r\nRattlesnake is an unmanned facility visited by operators on a periodic basis for system inspection.  If maintenance is required on any of the chlorine carrying parts of the system, at least two District personnel are present. \r\n\r\nChlorine is stored as a liquefied compressed gas in one-ton containers located in the Chlorine Storage Room.  There will be 10 containers connected to the system in two banks groups of 5 containers individually equipped with a vacuum regulator. Five additional containers will be stored in the same room.  All ton-containers will be set down in separate trunnions and strapped to hooks anchored to the ground.  At any given time, one bank of 5 containers will be active and the other five will be either on stand-by or empty, ready to be replaced.  \r\n\r\nThe system, as a safety measure, will draw chlorine from the vapor side of the containers; that is, the system will be connected to the upper valve of each container.  Thus, the containers will be the only part of the system where liquid chlorine will be present. A vacuum regulator that shuts off automatically on loss of vacuum will be directly attached to the upper valve of each container. A flexible tube will connect the container via a manual valve to a manifold.  \r\n\r\nThe entire system functions un"

A set of chlorinators will adjust the flow rate per operators' set level.  The vacuum regulators attached to each ton-container will ensure that system pressure downstream of the containers remain under vacuum. Upon loss of vacuum in the system, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulators will close, stopping chlorine from escaping the container.  Any chlorine in the piping downstream of the regulator, upon loss of vacuum, will be drawn by the injectors through the chlorinator, into the water.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum is created when water flows through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum (approximately 1-3 in. Hg) which opens the vacuum regulators.  The injectors have an internal check valve that prevents water entering the chlorine side of the system upon rapid changes in water pressure.  As an added protection, a check valve, a vacuum switch and a motor operated valve are installed upstream of each injector on the chlorine line.  The motor operated valve is intended to close when the chlorinator is shut off or when vacuum is lost.  The vacuum switch will be located downstream of the valve.\r\n\r\nThe only components in the system that will be equipped with a vent line are the vacuum regulators that will be attached to the containers.  The vent line will release into the Chlorine Storage Room.  It may be noted that the chlorinators do not have any venting devices.\r\n\r\nChlorine gas detectors are installed in the Chlorine Storage Room (two detectors) and in the Chlorinator Room (one detector).  These detectors are set at 0.5-ppm and 3-ppm activation levels. At 0.5-ppm an amber light flash outside the building and a SCADA alarm (i.e., an alarm on the central control computer monitored by the operators) is generated.

It draws air from the storage room and exhausts onto the roof.  As mentioned above, it activates automatically at the 3-ppm setting of the chlorine detectors in the storage room.  The scrubber is designed to handle up to one ton of chlorine. The scrubber system includes a caustic collection tank at its bottom portion and several contact beds immediately above it that drain into it.  Caustic solution, (sodium hydroxide 20 percent by weight), is sprayed down onto the beds by one of the two recirculating pumps.  The air from the storage room is drawn by a fan at the discharge side of the contact beds that exhausts vertically.  To minimize any caustic mist release from the exhaust duct, a mist eliminator is installed at the suction side of the fan.  The entire system is skid mounted including its own secondary containment and control panel. \r\n\r\nThe chlorine storage room is equipped with two supply fans and two exhaust fans that will operate continuously.  The fans shutoff on chlorine gas alarm at 3-ppm.
