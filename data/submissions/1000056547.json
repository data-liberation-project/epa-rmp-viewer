The flammable material is composed of a mixture that contains the following regulated substances: ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane. It is assumed that the mixture is composed entirely of the chemical that would cause the worst damage (i.e. highest heat of combustion) in this case ethane.\r\nThe entire weight of the mixture is used to calculate the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint. The scenario involved a release of 232,952 lb.  RMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.5 miles to the 1 psi endpoint, wind speed of 1.5 meters/second, stability class F with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).  \r\nb.\tAlternative Case scenario:\r\nThe off-site consequence analysis assumed that the vessel with the largest amount of natural gas liquids (NGL) had a small leak (1.5 inch hole) resulting in a vapor cloud fire. The alternative scenario is calculated using the chemical with the lowest lower flammability limit (LFL).  The LFL for butane, ethane and propane is 36 mg/L, and pentane has a LFL of 38 mg/L. Thus ethane was the chemical used in the analysis for the distance to the LFL limit.\r\nRMP Comp was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to endpoint, wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77 degrees F).  Since the scenario does not produce an offsite impact, no adverse impact to the public or to the environment is expected from this rel"
