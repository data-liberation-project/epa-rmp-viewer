USEPA defines alternative release scenarios as 1 psi over-pressure as a result of a timed release of a portion of the largest tank volume utilizing active measures to control the release of the regulated substance under neutral weather conditions.  \n\n To evaluate the worst case scenario for the particular regulated substance and conditions at this facility, we used equations from Appendix D of the USEPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute, a simplified EPA model based on the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For analysis of alternative release scenarios, we also employed the equations provided by the USEPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and RMP Compute.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe activities at the plant can be categorized by program 3 of the RMP guidance.  The projected worst case release scenario would involve a catastrophic release from the butane storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 87,000 pounds of butane.  Passive mitigation systems such as dikes were not considered when evaluating this scenario.  The worst case release scenario assumes that the entire quantity of the butane storage tank is released as a vapor,  an ignition source is present and 10 percent of the released quantity participates in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions (what is worst case weather conditions?), the maximum distance of 0.36 miles corresponds to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from the butane storage tank assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.

This commitment is inherent in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operation, and maintenance, of the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and to train employees regarding the safe operation of  processes involving regulated substances.  Although such an event is unlikely, employees are trained to react to unplanned releases of regulated substances.  In addition, the plant has coordinated with local and other emergency response organizations which provide highly trained emergency response personnel to help control and lessen the effects of any unplanned release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary manufacturing activity at this plant involves the production of plastic consumer products such as polystyrene foam trays.  We have one substance present at our facility which are regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Risk Management Program.  This substance is butane; and is referenced in this document by the term \"regulated substance\".  The regulated substance at our facility is used as a foaming agent in the production of the polystyrene foam.  These products are also often called \"blowing agents\" or \"expansion agents\" .\n\nThe maximum inventory of butane at our facility is approximately 87,000 pounds.\n \n3.\tWorst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nUnder RMP, USEPA requires facilities to determine the effects of catastrophic releases of regulated substances.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  We also have an air operating permit ID the Clean Air Act. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc.  maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a HazOp/Modified What If process.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of approximately every 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Tenneco Packaging Specialty and Consumer Products, Inc.  maintains written operating procedures.
