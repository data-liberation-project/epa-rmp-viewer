These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response Plan, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Versascold - Henderson facility is located at 830 E Horizon Drive in Henderson, Nevada.   With the exception of the Condensers and the Building A High Pressure Receiver, all of the ammonia equipment is located inside.  The facility consists of two buildings: Building A was constructed in 1988 and Building B was constructed in 1999.  An expansion of Building A was completed in 1994.\n\nThe primary business of Versascold - Henderson is to provide cooler and freezer warehousing space.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains two refrigeration systems, one in Building A and Building B.  The Building A and Building B refrigeration systems contain approximately 7,100 and 15,750 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, respectively.  Each refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the warehouse evaporators.  Typical operating conditions range from 1.6'' Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 150 psig on the high side of the system.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PR"

      "SummaryText": "OGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM);\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); and\n3) NDEP's Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Versascold - Henderson to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia systems are operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia systems are in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Versascold - Henderson's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration systems have been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits and there are ammonia sensors located throughout the facility which will shutdown the refrigeration system in the"

      "SummaryText": "event of detection of a release.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Operators perform inspections of each engine room and record typical operating parameters at least once daily.  Additionally, critical process parameters are continuously monitored by an external alarm company which will alert operators in the event an abnormal situation arises.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the Versacold \u00c2\u00bf Henderson facility's accident history during the PHA Revalidation (April 29, 2009) showed that there have been no federally reportable ammonia releases over the past five years (April 2004 through April 2009). However, there was a leak that required an internal investigation on September 26, 2008 in which a hot gas flange failed in Room 20 of the Building A ammonia system.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n- save lives;\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n- protect the environment; and\n- minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Emergency Response Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn 1997 and 1999 respectively, the Building A and Building B refrigeration systems were thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, a PHA Revalidation was performed in September 2004 and April 2009.  The 2009 PHA Revalidation consisted of:\n\n- a HAZOP"

All recommendations resulting from the revalidation study are due to be completed by February 2010."
