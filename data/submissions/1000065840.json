The corporate core values championed by our President, embraced by our Senior Leadership Team, encouraged by our Managers/Supervisors and pledged to our associates are: a) Caring Relationships, b) Entrepreneurial Spirit, c) Strategic Foresight, and d) High Performance. These 4 core values support our Safety and Health philosophy and management efforts. Interpersonal communications, problem solving, planning and safety achievement have a direct relationship with the core values when applied to safety training, hazard assessment/investigation, post-accident/incident recovery and generating solutions to potential risk exposures. U.S. Venture integrates Safety expectations as a part of Manager/Supervisors' responsibilities in order to create a meaningful daily presence during all work activity. All departments at the corporate level including Risk Management, Legal, Human Resources, Finance, and Operations reinforce strategic safety planning and solid operation level decision-making that will reduce risk exposures.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Oil Milwaukee Central Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution terminal that stores refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel oil, and denatured ethanol. These products are stored at the terminal, and shipped out via truck.  Butane is delivered to the facility by truck transports to two 30,000-gallon pressure vessels, which is then transferred via piping and associated equipment onsite and blended into gasoline.  The quantity of butane that is stored onsite exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold quantity, thus subjecting the facility to RMP requirements.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Oil Milwaukee Central Terminal regulated butane process complies with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 for Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LP"

The Wisconsin DSPS has approved the installation of the system. \r\n\r\nIf a fire emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Milwaukee Fire Department, (distance to closest fire station from terminal is 1.3 miles by road at 8463 N. Granville Road, Engine 38), as well as Milwaukee County Emergency Management, as necessary, with whom the facility emergency response plans have been coordinated. In the event of an accidental release of butane at the U.S. Oil Milwaukee Central Terminal butane system, Terminal Emergency Response Personnel have been trained to immediately activate an emergency shutdown device (ESD) at one of three locations depending on location of the release.\r\n\r\nWhen an ESD is activated and the alarm is not acknowledged within 20 seconds, CEC (Terminal Security Company) will be notified and a representative will call the terminal phone in response to confirm whether there is an actual emergency.  If there is no answer at the terminal to confirm whether help is needed, CEC will contact the terminal's on-call number.  CEC will continue calling terminal associates until they are able to speak with somebody in person to communicate the situation (they will not leave a voice message).\r\n\r\nAll personnel at this facility are 40-hour HAZWOPER certified and receive annual hazardous materials refresher training. \r\n\r\nU.S. Oil has an outstanding safety record, and to date, has not had an accident involving butane that has resulted in death, injury, property/environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place. \r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety include implementing a web-based notification system (SmartNotice) to enhance inte"

During an emergency situation, facility trained personnel will be able to send out a notification from the web or call a 24/7 phone number staffed by Emergency Communications Network (ECN), the provider of SmartNotice, who will facilitate sending out the message on U.S. Oil's behalf.  Notifications can be sent via email, text, and/or phone depending on each individual preference."
