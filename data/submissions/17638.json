The Rich SeaPak emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan that is tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.  The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe Rich SeaPak facility is located at 3555 East 14th Street, Brownsville, Cameron, Texas.  The food processing operation utilizes anhydrous ammonia in its processes.  21,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia are located in a single tank on the north side of the property.  The container has manual shutoff valves in case of an emergency, and an alarm will be triggered if a release occurs.  An emergency air supply and power are available.  The facility is manned 24-hours a day.  The anhydrous ammonia processes are checked routinely throughout the day.  Self-contained-breathing-apparatus (SCBA) are stored strategically throughout the facility.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for the Water treatment includes consideration of two different release scenarios for each of the parameters of concern (anhydrous ammonia): 1) A \"Worst Case Release\"; and 2) an \"Alternative Scenario\".  The \"Worst Case Release\" is defined by EPA guidance which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The Alternative Scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by a parameter of concern before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\".  The toxic endpoints are defined by the EPA as 0.14 ppm for anhydrous ammonia. These values correspond to the Emergency Response"

The calculations were performed with the CAMEO and RMPComp32 models as provided by USEPA and NOAA.

Enclosure of the tank in a separate building or covered was also considered but not feasible.\n\nThe Rich SeaPak accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements.\n\nStrong adherence to Process Safety Management;\nHigh level of training of the operators;\nPreventive maintenance program;\nUse of state of the art process and safety equipment;\nUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators; \nPerformance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures;\nImplementation of an audit and inspection program.  \n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), and Level A and B protective clothing, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of anhydrous ammonia, and the presence of a chemical detector.\n\nNo accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred in the past five years. \n\nThe facility has an emergency response program which has been coordinated (reviewed) by the City of Brownsville=s Fire and Police Departments.
