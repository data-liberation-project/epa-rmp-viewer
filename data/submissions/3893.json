      "SummaryText": "The wastewater treatment plant is located south of SH 198 in Gun Barrel City, Henderson County, Texas. Facilities are in place to store several one ton cylinders of chlorine for treatment of  discharge effluent .  Discharge from the District Wastewater Treatment Plant is regulated by NPDES Permit No. TX0074861. Chlorine is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The properties of chlorine which make the substance useful in the treatment of water necessitate safety precautions for prevention of unnecessary exposure. Such precautions reduce the threat of injury to plant employees and surrounding populations. Training of new employees should include the hazards of handing and using chlorine as outlined in Section 8, Prevention Program 2.  Emphasis of the training should be on prevention of accidents and injury associated with the storage and use of  chlorine. There have been no plant accidents in the preceding 5 year period. The  Accidental Release Prevention Program is in effect. The RMP Manualis available for use at the plant. Emergency Response Policies have been in effect and are now being revised as a part of the RMP."
