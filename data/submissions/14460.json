This  commitment is demonstrated by  the  resources\n\ninvested  in accident prevention, such as training personnel\n\nand   considering   safety  in  the  design,   installation,\n\noperation,  and maintenance of our processes. This  facility\n\nwas  designed  and constructed utilizing generally  accepted\n\nindustry codes and recommended practices such as ANSI,  ASME\n\nand  API.   It  is  our policy to adhere to  all  applicable\n\nfederal,  state, and local laws. Our policy is to  implement\n\nreasonable  controls  to  prevent  foreseeable  releases  of\n\nregulated  substances.  However, if a  release  does  occur,\n\nplans  have  been  developed  to  control  and  contain  the\n\nrelease.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\n\nSUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe  Block 31 gas plant is located west of Crane, Texas. The\n\nplant  has  several regulated flammables, such  as  methane,\n\nethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.\n\n\n\nThe  Block 31 plant handles gas produced from the  Block  31\n\nfield.   Produced  gas is processed to  remove  natural  gas\n\nliquids  (NGLs),  then  reinjected into  the  reservoir  for\n\npressure maintenance, used for fuel, or sold.\n\n\n\nGas  comes into the plant at pressures ranging from 10  psig\n\nto  1200  psig.   Gas must be at 1200 psig  for  processing;\n\ntherefore,  compression is required for streams coming  into\n\nthe  plant  at lower pressures.  Any liquid that  drops  out\n\nfrom the gas during compression is returned to the field and\n\ncombined with the oil production.\n\n\n\nAfter  inlet compression, the gas is split into two streams.\n\nPart  of the gas flows straight to injection, and part flows\n\nto the Nitrogen Rejection Facility (NRF) for processing.\n\n\n\nInjection Gas\n\n  Triethylene glycol is injected into this stream to prevent\n\nhydrate  formation"

The water vapor and a small amount of light\n\nhydrocarbon driven off in the reboiler.\n\n\n\n\n\nNitrogen Rejection Facility (NRF)\n\nDiglycolamine  (DGA) is used to sweeten, or remove  CO2  and\n\nH2S  from, the gas stream that flows through the  NRF.   The\n\nrich  DGA  is regenerated by reducing the pressure and  then\n\nheating the amine to remove any light hydrocarbons, CO2, and\n\nH2S.   Steam provides the heat needed for this regeneration.\n\nThe  hydrocarbon gases driven off are returned to the  plant\n\ninlet gas system.  The acid gases CO2 and H2S are compressed\n\nand  injected.  The lean DGA returns to the amine  contactor\n\nto sweeten more gas.\n\n\n\nNRF   feed   gas   is   dehydrated  after  the   sweetening.\n\nTriethylene glycol absorbs water and a small amount of light\n\nhydrocarbon  from the gas.  After contacting  the  gas,  the\n\nrich  glycol  is  heated and flows into a flash  tank  where\n\nlight  hydrocarbons vaporize.  These light hydrocarbons  are\n\nreturned  to  the plant inlet system.  Water  and  remaining\n\nhydrocarbon gases are removed from the glycol in the  glycol\n\nreboiler,   which  is  heated  by  steam.   The  water   and\n\nhydrocarbon  vent  gases  are released  to  the  atmosphere.\n\nPlans  are  underway  to  condense these  gases  to  recover\n\nliquids  and  return the remaining vapor back to  our  inlet\n\nsystem.  The lean glycol returns to the glycol contactors to\n\ncontinue the process.\n\n\n\nThe  gas  must  be free of all water, CO2,  and  H2S  before\n\nentering the cryogenic process.

This facility has training programs  in  place\n\nfor its personnel and a comprehensive maintenance program to\n\nensure  that the equipment is maintained properly to  reduce\n\nthe  possibility of a release of flammable liquids or gases.\n\nA  management of change policy is established that  requires\n\nall  facility  modifications to be reviewed by  engineering,\n\noperations and safety departments to promote the  safety  of\n\nthe employees and public.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe  Block 31 gas plant has an excellent record of  accident\n\nprevention over the past 5 years.
