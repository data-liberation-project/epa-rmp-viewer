THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n     THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFFSITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.\n 6.

WE PROVIDE A STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA). WE ALSO HAVE A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARDS, 29 CFR 1910.120, INCLUDING PRE-EMERGENCY PLANNING AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n 7.

THE FACILITY POLICY\n    THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CENTRAL FARMERS COOPERATIVE AT CLEARWATER ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL, CLEARWATER FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.                                    2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n    THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR BOTH DIRECT APPLICATION.   THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 183.300 POUNDS IN OUR THREE STORAGE TANKS, TWO BEING 12,000 GALLONS AND ONE BEING 15,000 GALLON. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A SEMI TRUCK HOLDING 34,000 POUNDS.\n 3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \n      A. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 7,500 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .31 MILES.\n        B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY (OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .41 MILES.\n 4. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K"
