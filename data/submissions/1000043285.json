The ammonia is stored at the site in a liquid form.\n\n     NORPAC complies with rules, regulations, and recommendations from OR-OSHA, ASME, IIAR, EPA, DEQ, PSM, etc.  NORPAC also keeps full time refrigeration engineering personnel on duty to monitor, operate, and maintain the equipment and process.  The refrigeration engineering personnel receives on the job training as well as off site training dealing in the maintenance and safety of the equipment and of the process.\n\n     NORPAC Foods Brooks Plant #5 has not had a release resulting in an off site consequence since the plant at 4755 Brooklake Road NE, Salem, OR, started using anhydrous ammonia in 1972.  NORPAC has set up emergency evacuation plans for the plant.  These plans would go into effect with the local emergency responders.\n\n     NORPAC uses safety committees, on the job training, safety seminars and safety training to identify and improve the overall safety at the facility."
