In this way we promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to minimize the occurance, and the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances,  as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                \nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including the use, storage,  handling, or on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\n\nOur safety programs minimize accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, or equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility. \n\n                                                                                                                                            Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             "

The system operation is similar to the operation of a household refrigerator.  The total ammonia inventory on site is 53,000 pounds.  The ammonia is used in the freezing process of okra, squash, carrots, greens, onions, celery and broccoli.\n                                                                                                                                                                   \n\nWorst-case Scenario\n\nFailure of the high-pressure receiver containing 53,000 pounds of ammonia would result in a ten minute release.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons: industry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels; ammonia is not corrosive in this service; pressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel; the accident prevention program in place at the facility including the mechanical integrity program for regular maintenance; inspection and testing, and replacement of equipment, if necessary; installed ammonia sensors to warn of leaks; and the emergency response plan and equipment in place at the facility.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \n\nFailure of a 1/4 inch diameter pipe would result in the release of approximately 6,000 pounds of ammonia over a time period of 60 minutes.  Under common weather conditions, ammonia would travel 0.10 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public or the environment.  The 1/4 inch pipe was chosen because it is used to temporarily bleed off a pump so that maintenance activities can be conducted.  This scenario is un"

The key prevention steps at the facility consists of the following:    Process Safety Information,  Process Hazard Ananlysis,  Standard Operating Procedures, Training,  Mechanical Integrity Program,  Management of Change,  Pre-startup Safety Review,  Compliance Audits,  Incident Investigations,Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, and Contractor Qualifications. \n\n\nFive Year Accident HIstory\n\nThere has been no reportable accidents in the last five years. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Emergency Response Program\n\nAlamo facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).
