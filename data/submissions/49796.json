      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIochem Corporation, Vici, Oklahoma\n\nSeptember 7, 2007\n\nStationary Source and Process\nIochem produces iodine from sodium iodide at the facility located near Vici, OK.  Sodium iodide is extracted from brine production wells.  Brine flows from the wells to the facility where the iodide containing brines are oxidized with chlorine and converts the iodides to elemental iodine vapor.  Iodine vapor is stripped and reabsorbed into a more concentrated iodide solution with the addition of sulfur dioxide.  This solution is again oxidized to solid elemental iodine that is melted, flaked, and packaged into fiber drums.\n\nEPA regulated substances in this single process are toxic chemicals chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  These substances are stored in adjacent tanks under pressure in the liquid state.  The liquids are vaporized and piped to the processing units.\n\nMaximum inventory is 87,098 pounds of chlorine, and 70,400 pounds of sulfur dioxide, both of which exceed the EPA RMP threshold quantities of 2,500 and 5,000 pounds, respectively.\n\nOffsite Hazard Assessment\nIn the event that the regulated substance is released to the atmosphere, EPA requires that the facility provide an offsite hazard assessment and consequence analysis.  This must include analyzing two release scenarios (Worst Case and Alternate Case) to determine the toxic end point.\n\nToxic end point is based on ERPG-2 concentrations developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  The ERPG-2 is a maximum airborne concentration which is believed that almost all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious irreversible health effects or other symptoms that could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.  AIHA has identified the toxic end point for chlorine and sulfur dioxide as 0.0087 and 0.0078 mg/L, respectively.\n\nThe worst case scenario is releasing in ten minutes the entire contents of pressurized sulfur dioxide from the storage tank into th"

Modeling does not include the effects of fires, chemical reactions, and other factors.\n\nThe Alternate Case is more likely to occr than the Worst Case.  An alternate case is required for each toxic chemical.  For chlorine and sulfur dioxide, the scenario is a ?? leak from ruptured tubing or pipe.  Operator?s response time to stop the leak is estimated at 60 minutes.  Release rates are 8.2 and 3.4 lbs/minute, respectively.  Toxic end points are 0.1 mile radius from each storage tank; there are no public or environmental receptors within this distance.\n\nPrevention of Release\nThe process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety Information according to Process Safety Management (PSM).  It is the policy of Iochem Corporation to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle sulfur dioxide and chlorine, safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, safe handling and operating procedures, and training of our personnel.  By emphasizing at Iochem Corporation well-maintained equipment, proper procedures, and well-trained staff, the likelihood of a release will be reduced.  Recommendations for addressing the process hazards that are generated in the PH A, compliance audits, incident investigations, and management of change are used to improve the process safety.\n\nPrevention Program 3 (RMP) as described in 40 CFR 68 is followed to accomplish these goals and will minimize the potential for an unplanned release of the regulated substances into the environment.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nIn the past five years, there has been no accidental release.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nIochem Corporation is a non-responding facility8 to an accidental release of hazardous material"
