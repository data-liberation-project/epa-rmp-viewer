We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our workers the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n?A description of our facility and our uses of substances that are regulated by EPA?s RMP regulation.\n\n?An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\n?A five-year history of accidental releases for chemicals that are regulated by EPA?s RMP rule.\n\n?An overview of our emergency response program.\n\n?An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accident chemical releases from occurring and therefore adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nVopak Terminal Deer Park is a for-hire liquid storage terminal.  Chemicals and refined petroleum products represent the majority of the bulk liquids stored, handled and transported in this facility.  Products are received into and transported from the facility via ship, barge, pipeline, tank car, and tank truck.  At this time the facility is storing four chemicals (Propylene Oxide, Vinyl Acetate Monomer Isoprene and Piperylene [1,3 Pentadiene]) that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences under their Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Propylene Oxide and Vinyl Acetate Monomer are considered toxic substances under EPA's RMP rule.  Propylene Oxide and Vinyl Acetate Monomer are also considered flammable liquids with a flash point below 100 degrees Fahrenheit under the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) Proc"

However, the OSHA PSM rule exempts flammable liquids from the regulation as highly hazardous chemicals under the rule if they are stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration, per 29 CFR 1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(B).  Vinyl Acetate Monomer is stored in an atmospheric tank at the terminal below its boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration; therefore, this storage is exempt from the OSHA PSM rule.  Propylene Oxide is stored is an atmospheric tank at the terminal, but is maintained below its boiling point with the use of refrigeration; therefore, this storage is regulated as a highly hazardous chemical under the OSHA PSM rule.  Vinyl Acetate Monomer storage at the terminal is not regulated as highly hazardous chemical under the OHSA PSM rule; therefore, it would normally be regulated under Program Level 2 of the RMP rule.  Isoprene, Piperylene, and Propylene Oxide are considered highly hazardous substances under the OSHA PSM rule due to their flammability; therefore, these two chemicals are regulated under Program Level 3 of the RMP rule.  Vopak has chosen to apply Program Level 3 requirements of the RMP rule to all RMP covered processes at the facility, including Vinyl Acetate Monomer, Isoprene, Piperylene, and Propylene Oxide to provide for ease of compliance with RMP rules.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.
