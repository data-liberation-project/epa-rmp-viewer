This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Regency policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent forseeable releases of substances.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nRegency operates the Elm Grove Dew Point Control Plant in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.  This facility is a natural gas processing plant which uses mechanical refrigeration to remove liquids from the gas stream.  Glycol dehydration is used to remove water from the stream.  Mixed liquids from the refrigeration plant are stored in atmospheric tanks prior to being shipped off-site in tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Elm Grove Dew Point Control Plant is a Program 1 process.\n\nElm Grove Dew Point Control Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\nRegency identified three flammable liquid mixtures and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest vessel quantity stored.  Two of the flammable liquid mixtures exceeded the threshold quantity.  The identification of this exceeda"

Emergency response activities are coordinated with local fire department as required in 40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)."
