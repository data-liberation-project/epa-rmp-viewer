Data elements and SO2 ARS updated, but no change to other WCS or ARS or in accident history\n28-Oct-05 - Revised RMP to reflect new regulated substance in existing facility and 2 new accidents in 5 year accident history.\n21-Jun-04 - Revised RMP per 5 year update requirement.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California site (\"Dow Pittsburg\") is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Dow Pittsburg's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow Pittsburg's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Dow Pittsburg is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activity at Dow Pittsburg is agricultural chemical manufacturing.  Dow Pittsburg has seven regulated substances present at the site.  These substances include acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, ammonia (aqueous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene are used in making emulsion polymers.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making emulsion polymers and an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultu"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Dow Pittsburg site was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDow Pittsburg maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nDow Pittsburg conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Dow Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI), Dow Chemical Exposure Index (CEI), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis (RC/PHA), Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), Reactive Chemical Reviews, and project Safety & Loss Prevention Reviews.  Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dow Pittsburg's covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various m"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nDow Pittsburg has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years, and more frequently as needed, for required process and safety topics.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDow Pittsburg carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance.  These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow Pittsburg to safely manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted by appropriate personnel as a regular practice at Dow Pittsburg.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment "

      "SummaryText": " Five-year Accident History\n\nDow Pittsburg has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases due to the site's release prevention policies.  There have been no accidental releases from Dow Pittsburg within the last 5 years with offsite impact (deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  There have been 7 onsite injuries as a result of 4 separate accidental releases of regulated substances in the last 5 years, two events involving a one pound or less chlorine release, one involving a 27 pound aqueous ammonia release and one involving a 186 pound chlorine release, all of which required medical treatment.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nDow Pittsburg utilizes a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, Dow Pittsburg emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCA Region II LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan for the Dow Pittsburg site has been coordinated and verified. Dow Pittsburg also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups, which provide Dow Pittsburg with additional emergency response capability.\n\n6.
