These facilities may be required to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP). The RMP must include the following key elements.\n\n\n\n(1)Hazard Assessment\n\n(2)Prevention Program\n\n(3)Emergency Response\n\n(4)External Events\n\n\n\nAlthough in many ways an extension of the California Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) and Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, there are many more Facilities encompassed by CalARP/RMP, and there are numerous differences that covered facilities must be sensitive to.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nIn reviewing the potentially covered processes at California Dairies Tipton facility, the only RMP-covered process is the Ammonia Refrigeration System.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Dairies uses the ammonia refrigeration system to chill and hold product. The ammonia system utilized by California Dairies includes a liquid ammonia receiver. High-pressure liquid ammonia flows from the high-pressure receiver to the pump recirculator and then to the evaporators and silos where the pressure is reduced by allowing the ammonia to expand through expansion valves. The resulting low-pressure liquid ammonia is evaporated to provide refrigeration. Ammonia vapor exiting the evaporators is returned to the engine room. The resultant dry vapor is drawn to the compressor where it is compressed. The compressed vapor is then condensed to its liquid from in the evaporative condensers and returned to the high-pressure receiver.                                                                    \n\n                                                                                                                               This CalARP/RMP Submittal is offered to address the following regul"

The surrounding rural area consists of some residential development. The facility produces and stores dairy products. The ammonia refrigeration system is defined as a closed loop \"Direct\" type system.\n\n\n\nThe California Dairies Tipton facility has developed a risk management program to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, EPA Title 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119) and to enhance an already existing safety and emergency action programs. California Dairies is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. California Dairies staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGANCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nCalifornia Dairies has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the "

      "SummaryText": "Ammonia Refrigeration System and Cogen systems. Their policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nSystem Operation cycle begins at the high-pressure receiver where liquid ammonia is fed from the receiver to the flooded accumulator. At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature, then flows down to the heat exchanger where it absorbs heat from the glycol. The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels through the evaporative condenser where the ammoina gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high-pressure receiver to begin the cycle over again.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25, the worst-case and alternate case release scenarios were calculated for the covered process at the California Dairies facility and the written results of the off-site consequence scenarios are on file at the facility.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\n\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case event non-credible. In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., in the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entertainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than in the model).\n\n\n\nIn addition to "
