Wherever we operate, we will conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risks to drive sustainable business growth. We will not be satisfied until we succeed in eliminating all injuries, occupational illnesses, unsafe practices and incidents of environmental harm from our activities.  \n\nIn fulfilling this commitment, management will ensure systems are in place to provide the resources and training to identify issues and maintain a safe and healthful environment as indicated by Company standards, accepted safety and environmental practices, and compliance with legislative requirements.  We will operate and maintain our plants, facilities and equipment and handle our raw materials and products in a manner to prevent personal injuries/illnesses, losses to Company property, releases to the environment, or impact to the communities in which we operate.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe San Francisco Refinery, located in Rodeo, California, processes crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces gasoline, automotive diesel, butane, fuel oil and petroleum coke.  In order to produce these products, we store and handle large quantities of regulated flammable materials.  \n\nTo reduce air pollution, the Rodeo Refinery power plant is equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction devices that convert oxides of nitrogen (NOx) to harmless nitrogen and water.  These devices use a solution of ammonia in water (aqueous ammonia), a regulated substance, to perform this conversion.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe EPA requires facilities to report on potential worst-case scenarios involving the regulated substances that we handle in"

A flammable worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to suddenly disappear, the contents were to instantaneously vaporize, and a resulting vapor cloud were to ignite and explode.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) represents a more likely event.  It is used to determine a reasonable outer bound for potential impacts in order to coordinate with local emergency responders.  \n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Rodeo refinery does not go beyond the property and has no offsite impact.  As such, the facility storing the ammonia is considered a Program Level 1 process.  No alternate release scenario for ammonia is provided. \n\nThe flammable worst-case scenario for the Rodeo Refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of our largest butane storage vessel.  Butane is the material that is used in disposable lighters.  Butane is a gas at room temperature and the liquid must be stored under pressure in vessels designed for this purpose.  The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that the instantaneous release and subsequent explosion of the entire contents of the vessel would result in offsite impact.  The toxic endpoint specified by EPA for this type of release is an overpressure of 1 psi.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammable materials is an explosion from a large leak in the butane piping systems.  This event is still un"

In addition, contractor employees working in lead positions must have passed the refinery safety skills test.  This test was developed in 1998 by a coalition of refinery owners, labor representatives and Contractors to measure the craftsperson's knowledge of certain critical tasks that must be performed properly to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refinery.\n\nThe control of contractor's access to the facility is managed through Refinery Security.  Contractor employees must check-in with the guard at the gate prior to entering the refinery.  Keycards are issued to contract employees who work in areas where access is controlled by a turnstile or card keyed gate.  \n\nThe control of contractors to process areas is managed as part of the safe work practices as discussed under Operating Procedures.  Operators control all non-operator access to the process area.  All personnel, including contractor and refinery employees, who are not operators must report to the control room before entering the process area.  The operator reviews the task to be performed with the non-operator employee.  \n\nAs part of Federal, State and local regulations, Contractors are required to notify the refinery of any hazards presented by their work or found during their work.  Prior to performance of any tasks, contract employees fill out a checklist (a job hazard analysis) that covers performance of the safe work practices covered by the permitting program. \n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has a program to manage changes to unit operations.
