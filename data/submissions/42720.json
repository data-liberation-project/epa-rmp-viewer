Wherever we operate, we will conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risks to drive sustainable business growth. We will not be satisfied until we succeed in eliminating all injuries, occupational illnesses, unsafe practices and incidents of environmental harm from our activities.  \n\nIn fulfilling this commitment, management will ensure systems are in place to provide the resources and training to identify issues and maintain a safe and healthful environment as indicated by Company standards, accepted safety and environmental practices, and compliance with legislative requirements.  We will operate and maintain our plants, facilities and equipment and handle our raw materials and products in a manner to prevent personal injuries/illnesses, losses to Company property, releases to the environment, or impact to the communities in which we operate.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe San Francisco Refinery, located in Rodeo, California, processes crude oil into useable petroleum products for our customers.  The refinery produces gasoline, automotive diesel, butane, fuel oil and petroleum coke.  In order to produce these products, we store and handle large quantities of regulated flammable materials.  \n\nTo reduce air pollution, the Rodeo Refinery power plant is equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction devices that convert oxides of nitrogen (NOx) to harmless nitrogen and water.  These devices use a solution of ammonia in water (aqueous ammonia), a regulated substance, to perform this conversion.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe EPA requires facilities to report on potential worst-case scenarios involving the regulated substances that we handle in "

As a result, these scenarios ignore prevention programs that are designed to limit the number and size of chemical releases from our facility.  A toxic worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to be damaged such that it released its entire contents within ten minutes without accounting for response measures that we would take to minimize the impact of such a release.  A flammable worst-case scenario describes the potential impacts if the vessel containing the largest quantity of the substance were to suddenly disappear, the contents were to instantaneously vaporize, and a resulting vapor cloud were to ignite and explode.\n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) represents a more likely event.  It is used to determine a reasonable outer bound for potential impacts in order to coordinate with local emergency responders.  \n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario for the Rodeo refinery does not go beyond the property and has no offsite impact.  As such, the facility storing the ammonia is considered a Program Level 1 process.  No alternate release scenario for ammonia is provided. \n\nThe flammable worst-case scenario for the Rodeo Refinery is based on releasing the entire contents of our largest butane storage vessel.  Butane is the material that is used in disposable lighters.  Butane is a gas at room temperature and the liquid must be stored under pressure in vessels designed for this purpose.  The results of the worst-case scenario indicate that the instantaneous release and subsequent explosion of the entire contents of the vessel would result in offsite impact.  The toxic endpoint specified by EPA for this type of release is an overpressure of 1 psi.\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammable materials is an explosion from a large leak in the butane piping systems.

Odors were reported offsite and a precautionary shelter-in-place advisory was issued to the public.  No injuries on or offsite were reported.  Inadequate isolation procedures were identified as the root cause of this incident.  The investigation from this incident resulted in corrective actions which have been implemented.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following summaries represent numerous prevention programs and practices at the Rodeo Refinery.  Rodeo Refinery employees are committed to operating a safe facility through the establishment, review, and continuous improvement of these programs and practices.  \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include safety committee involvement, developing and reviewing safe operating procedures, and participation in the process hazard analysis program.   Information on the refinery's prevention programs is available to employees, and they are encouraged to recommend improvements to any of the programs.  In addition, refinery management has a strong commitment to developing and enforcing written policies and procedures and encourages employee input to identify when a policy or procedure needs to be changed or improved to cover new tasks, revised regulations, or employee experience. \n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery maintains an extensive library of Process Safety Information.

These documents include detailed information on chemical properties and their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design and configuration.  This information is available to all employees. \n\nChemical specific information, including hazards, protective measures, symptoms, and first aid procedures is provided via Material Safety Data Sheets.  This information is available in hard copy format and via the refinery computer network.\n\nThe limits for key process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, flow, and level) are documented in the unit operating manuals.  The process is maintained within these limits using computer process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\nInformation on the design and construction of process equipment includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides the basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that protective features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined using a technique known as process hazard analysis, or PHA.  A team of experienced operators, engineers, and other specialists conducts the analyses.  This team systematically identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as existing accident prevention and mitigation measures and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team's recommendations are then reviewed with management personnel for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive the highest priority.  Actions implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe process hazard analysis for each process unit is updated and re-validated at least every five years.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, any team findings are reviewed with management personnel for resolution and any actions that result are tracked until they are completed.  \n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery utilizes written procedures that address various phases of process operations including (1) initial startup of a newly constructed process, (2) unit startup, (3) normal operations, (4) temporary operations, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) emergency shutdown.  These procedures provide the basis for consistent initial or refresher training of operators.  The procedures are managed by operating personnel and are updated as necessary to reflect changes and new information.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually to verify that they are current, updated, and accurate. \n\nOperating procedures and operating manuals are available in hard copy format in each process unit control room.\n\nOPERATOR TRAINING\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, the Rodeo Refinery has a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process.

Throughout the training process, candidates must continue to qualify by passing written and oral tests, thereby demonstrating understanding and retention of the training materials.  Qualification for all operating posts within a process area can take up to 3 years.\n\nRefresher training on operating procedures is provided to operating employees at least every three years, and refresher safety training is performed annually.  In addition, training emphasizing specific topics is performed as necessary (for example, furnace operation, dock operations, etc.).  Prior to the commissioning of new or modified equipment, written operating procedures are developed and training is provided to affected operating personnel.  Operating personnel also receive training in emergency response and fire fighting procedures.  \n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY/MAINTENANCE TRAINING\n\nThe first step in a successful mechanical integrity program is ensuring that equipment and processes are properly designed for their intended use.  The Rodeo Refinery utilizes specific written procedures and design criteria for its operating equipment.  These criteria are contained in Engineering Standards -- referenced to recognized industry standards (such as API, ASME, ANSI, and NFPA) -- or specified by engineering firms with expertise in a specific area of design.  \n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, instrumentation and emergency shutdown systems, pumps, and compressors in proper operating condition.

This program applies to all contractor employees working in process areas.  The Contractor program is beneficial to accidental release prevention because it ensures that contractor employees are trained in and practice safe work practices.\n\nContractors must pass a qualification process prior to hire.  First, the Contractor must complete a pre-qualification package that covers their Worker's Compensation Experience Modification Rate, OSHA 300 Log, compliance with Title 8 CCR Section 3202 (Injury and Illness Prevention Program), drug and alcohol testing program, employee training programs, and Process Safety Programs.  After hire, the Contractor's compliance with Process Safety Management (PSM) and their safety performance at the refinery is periodically audited.  In addition, the Contractor Safety Coordinator maintains a safety record for the contract employees during their employment at the Rodeo Refinery.\n\nAlthough it is the Contractor's responsibility to train their employees in the process hazards and emergency action plan and to document that training, the refinery requires all contractor employees annually attend a safety orientation specific to the refinery.  This class covers safety policies and procedures, safe work practices, PPE, permitting program, the meaning of the refinery alarms, the evacuation routes and evacuation gathering locations.\n\nIn addition, all contractor employees working in process areas where their work could affect the process must attend a Bay Area Training Corporation ("

The contractor employees must pass a test on these materials prior to completion of the BATC class.  In addition, contractor employees working in lead positions must have passed the refinery safety skills test.  This test was developed in 1998 by a coalition of refinery owners, labor representatives and Contractors to measure the craftsperson's knowledge of certain critical tasks that must be performed properly to ensure safe operation and maintenance of the refinery.\n\nThe control of contractor's access to the facility is managed through Refinery Security.  Contractor employees must check-in with the guard at the gate prior to entering the refinery.  Keycards are issued to contract employees who work in areas where access is controlled by a turnstile or card keyed gate.  \n\nThe control of contractors to process areas is managed as part of the safe work practices as discussed under Operating Procedures.  Operators control all non-operator access to the process area.  All personnel, including contractor and refinery employees, who are not operators must report to the control room before entering the process area.  The operator reviews the task to be performed with the non-operator employee.  \n\nAs part of Federal, State and local regulations, Contractors are required to notify the refinery of any hazards presented by their work or found during their work.  Prior to performance of any tasks, contract employees fill out a checklist (a job hazard analysis) that covers performance of the safe work practices covered by the permitting program. \n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Rodeo Refinery has a program to manage changes to unit operations.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals and feedstocks, technology, procedures, and other facility changes are authorized and properly reviewed before being implemented.
