KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sterlington Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by barge and stored until it is loaded on to trucks and injected into pipelines for distribution.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (the latter used in the water treatment process) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Sterlington Terminal in amounts above the threshold quantity.  The terminal is subject to the Prevention Program/Program 3 requirements.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\nOperating in compliance with required environmental pe"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Minimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot.  \n?Providing an interlock system, which will shutdown ammonia loading pumps upon high pressure during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia due to over-pressurization.\n?Installing ammonia detectors at the property boundary to ensure that an ammonia release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n?Requiring personnel protective equipment and emergency air (escape packs) at all loading areas.\n?Requiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\n?Unloading barges only when KNC personnel and barge company personnel are present to monitor and control the loading operations.\n?Providing emergency shutdown buttons at the barge unloading and truck loading areas that can be activated in case of an ammonia release.\n?Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do n"

As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be St. Francis Hospital in Monroe, the Louisiana State Police, the U.S. Coast Guard, and Entergy.  The Sterlington Terminal Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place, and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the EHS&T Management System, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\n?The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, th"
