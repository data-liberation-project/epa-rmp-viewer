Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Chem Quip, Inc. facility stores and distributes swimming pool equipment, supplies and water treating chemicals at its distribution and warehouse facility located at 6959 Eastside Road, Redding California.  The surrounding area is developed as industrial/commercial and residential.\n\n   \n\nChem Quip, Inc. has assessed the potential affects of an accidental release of a hazardous substance. The assessment includes performing an offsite consequence analysis. This analysis includes a worst case scenario and one alternative scenario.\n\n\n\nThe Chem Quip, Inc. facility has established a prevention program to prevent the accidental release of the regulated substance. This program includes safety precautions, maintenance, inspections, and employee training.\n\n\n\n An  emergency action program has also been established that requires specific actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. These actions include procedures for notifying public and local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases and employee response training measures.\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Chem Quip, Inc.
