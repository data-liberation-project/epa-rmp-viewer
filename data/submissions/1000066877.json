The oleum drums are physically located in a diked containment area that flows into a spill pit.  In the event of a spill, the mineral oil system will provide a protective barrier that will reduce emissions.  The drums are protected against pressure and temperature fluctuations by a nitrogen blanketing system (for low pressures) and relief devices that vent through a scrubber (for high pressures). The drums and associated piping are routinely inspected for external and internal corrosion.  The drums are monitored via video camera and all of the drums have automated valves that can be shut from the control room. There are also water monitors surrounding the drums that would be used to knock down vapors from any spill.\n\n+ As with other chemicals of concern, ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic shut-off and relief devices to handle fluctuations in temperature and pressure.  Warning alarms, regular equipment inspections and pressure monitoring in pipes and vessels provide layers of protection for employees and the community.\n\n+ The formaldehyde storage tank is equipped with a spill pit to contain the contents of any accidental liquid releases.  A monitor nozzle is in place to control vapor releases from the tank.  Automatic shut-off devices, relief valves and safety alarms provide additional protection.\n\n+ The acrylonitrile storage tank and its recirculation line are contained within a diked area to contain any liquid release.  The suction line at the bottom of the tank has an automated fire-safe shut-off valve.  There is a"

The acrylonitrile truck unloading area sump drains to a spill pit that has an AR-AFFF foam addition system in case of a spill.  The foam would reduce vapor emissions.  There are also three LEL detectors located in the tank diked area and one located near the truck unloading area.\n\n+ Chemical flammability is a great concern for BASF.  Many steps are taken to prevent accidental releases.  Thermal relief and automatic shut-off system are incorporated into process designs.  Systems are in place to quickly relocate or dispose of propylene, trimethylamine, and hydrogen in emergency situations.  Continuous monitoring of pipe and vessel pressure identifies potential leaks for further protection.  \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases over the past five years which meet the reporting criteria.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nEmergency response programs are in place for both internal preparation and coordination with the community. The Freeport Site plan is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee to ensure community safety. Drills are coordinated with the community and the community warning sirens are tested weekly.  In the event of an incident, information is transmitted over a local radio station. BASF participates in the Industrial CAER program (Community Awareness and Emergency Response), which operates a hotline for communication with the community.  In addition to the site plan, each operating unit has a block specific emergency plan.  These plans contain information specific to chemicals within the unit.  Incident commander training is conducted annually. Information on emergency health care is incorporated into the emergency plan.
