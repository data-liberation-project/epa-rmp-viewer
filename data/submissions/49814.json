Parish Electric Generating Station.\n\nGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nW.A. Parish Electric Generating Station is located in Thompsons, Texas.  The facility is a 3,800-MW electric generation facility consisting of eight steam electric generating units.  A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is associated with the each of the four coal-fired units.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is an approximately 30% solution of ammonia in water.\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at W.A. Parish is comprised of storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The four tanks each have a capacity of 80,000 gallons but are administratively limited to holding 76,000 gallons.  Each tank is equipped with a presure relief valve, a vacuum breaker valve with flame arrestor, and liquid level indicators.\n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and handling.\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\nW.A.
