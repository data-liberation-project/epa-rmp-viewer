The ammonia refrigeration system is operated by a refrigeration contract firm.  A variety of safety devices are employed within the system, included are high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. A improved system will be installed at this facility.  A further evaluation is under way at this facility. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.  Equipment and operating parameters are monitored throughout the day and parameters are logged for comparison.                                                           This facilities emergency response program is an action plan to evacuate the facility and allow the local Hazmat Team to intervene and bring the situation under control with assistance from Cloverleafs refrigeration personnel. The plan has been discussed with the responding Fire Department."
