      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe operations at Milk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac include processing whey.  An ammonia refrigeration system is used to provide cooling of tanks and chillers.\n\n\n\nMilk Specialties Global is committed to the health and safety of its employees and the community, and to the protection of the environment.  Therefore, Milk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac is complying with EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations, Title 40 CFR Part 68, in conjunction with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, which deals with the risks of storing, handling, and processing hazardous chemicals.  Milk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac has completed the RMP and PSM program requirements to educate and protect its employees, the public, and the environment with respect to the anhydrous ammonia located at the facility.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\nMilk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac has developed a Management System in accordance with 40 CFR 68.15 to oversee the implementation of the RMP elements.  The Management System identifies the title of the individual with the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.  The Management System is documented to ensure effective communications through MSG, clarify the roles and responsibilities of MSG personnel, and to ensure that the RMP program elements are integrated into an ongoing approach to identify hazards and manage risks. \n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analyses\n\nAs part of the RMP, worst-case and alternate case release scenarios have been evaluated.  The worst-case scenario is a release from the largest receiver, which was determined to be the high pressure receiver. In accordance with the RMP, the high pressure receiver was assumed to be released within a 10-minute period.  \n\n\n\nThe following assumptions were used for the worst-case scenario:\n\n\n\n?    Wind speed of 1.5 meters/second;\n\n?    F stability class; and\n\n?    Toxic end"

Based on the surroundings, the area was considered urban for the purpose of the analysis.  The distance to impact was determined using the EPA program RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nFor the alternate-case release scenario, several scenarios were considered including a failure in the condenser piping (outside), a pinhole in the piping released within the building, a pressure relief valve release, and a glycol chiller hit by fork truck (inside).  The relief valve release was chosen for the alternate scenario included in the RMP submittal. Based on Appendix E (Supplemental Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration) in the General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention, the following simplified version of Bernoulli's Equation was used to calculate the ammonia release:\n\n\n\nQR = HA x (203) (Pg)0.5\n\n\n\n    Where:\n\n        QR = Release rate (pounds per minute)\n\n        HA = Hole area (square inches)\n\n        Pg = Gauge Pressure (psig)\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the following assumptions are made for the alternate scenario:\n\n\n\n?    Wind speed of 3 meters/second;\n\n?    D stability class; and\n\n?    Toxic endpoint of 200 ppm (0.14 mg/l) for ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe area was considered urban for the purpose of the analysis.  The analysis took into account the partial mitigation of an enclosure.  The distance to impact was determined using the EPA program RMP*Comp.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere were no accidents to report for the last five years.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nMilk Specialties Global - Fond du Lac has adopted safety programs to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of a significant release of ammonia.  The programs focus on rules, procedures and practices which govern the ammonia refrigeration system.  The programs are subject to the requirements of an EPA RMP Prevention Program 3 facility.  A Program 3 facility is a facility which does not meet the requirements"

The facility has written and maintains an Emergency Response Program which provides for detailed:\n\n\n\n?    Procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies about accidental releases.\n\n\n\n?
