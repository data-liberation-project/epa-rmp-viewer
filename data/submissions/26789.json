We use a combination of accidental release \nprevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the \nsafety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This \ndocument provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities \nthat we have designed and implemented for the handling and use of substances regulated \nby the EPA RMP, including the following:\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the EPA RMP rule\n- Our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n- A summary of the results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences \nfrom accidental releases of substances regulated by the RMP rule\n- Our general accidental release prevention program and specific release prevention \nsteps for the RMP regulated substances\n- A five-year history of accidents associated with substances regulated by the RMP rule \n- Our emergency response program\n- Planned changes to improve safety \n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sugar Land plant produces numerous chemical products using a variety of raw \nmaterials and processing operations. From these different raw materials and operations, \nthe plant annually produces more than 100 million pounds of specialty chemicals for our \ncustomers. Approximately 170 employees work year round to meet the needs of oilfield \nproducers, refiners, and chemical plants. \n\nIn our processes, we use the following chemicals that the EPA has regulated as either \ntoxic or flammable substances under the RMP rule, in quantities in excess of the \napplicable threshold amount: \n \nToxics\n-Cyclohexylamine\n-Epichlorohydrin\n-Ethylenediamine\n\nFlammables\n-Trimethylamine\n\nOur accidental"

It is worth noting that the RMP definition of a potential worst-case scenario \nresults in an event that is far beyond any reasonable expectation. The alternate release \nscenarios represent more credible, although still unlikely, events.\n\nThe following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the \nkey administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for \neach scenario.\n\n3.1 Worst-case Release Scenario for Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nOur worst case toxic release scenario is the rupture of a tank truck containing \nepichlorohydrin while unloading into our storage tank. The tank truck rupture would \nrelease 45,000 pounds of epichlorohydrin into a diked containment area with a surface \narea of 1430 square feet. This worst-case release would only reach offsite endpoints and \npublic receptors within a distance of 0.4 miles from the containment area. \n\n3.2 Alternative Release Scenario(s) for Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nWe have evaluated one alternative release scenario for each of our regulated toxic \nchemicals. These scenarios are summarized below.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for epichlorohydrin is a break in the transfer piping, \nresulting in the release of 1500 pounds over a ten-minute period. This release would only \nreach offsite endpoints and public receptors within a distance of 0.1 miles from the \nrelease area. There are no residences within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for cyclohexylamine is a break in the transfer piping, \nresulting in the r"

This release would only \nreach offsite endpoints and public receptors within a distance of 0.1 miles from the \nrelease area. There are no residences within this distance.\n\n3.3 Worst-case Release Scenario for Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nOur worst-case flammable release scenario is the rupture of a tank storing an aqueous \nsolution of trimethylamine, which would result in the release of 55,000 pounds of \ntrimethylamine. A subsequent vapor cloud explosion of the trimethylamine would result \nin a 1 psi overpressure at a distance of 0.3 miles from the tank.\n\n3.4 Alternative Release Scenario for Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario for trimethylamine is a break in the transfer piping, \nresulting in the release of 1500 pounds in one minute. A subsequent vapor cloud fire \nwould result in a distance to the lower flammability limit of <0.1 miles from the release \narea. There are no residences within this distance.\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases of regulated \nchemicals and to ensure safe operation. The accident prevention programs in place \ninclude:\n\n- Process safety information: We have a program in place to ensure that information \nis available regarding the hazards of the regulated chemicals, the processes which \nhandle these chemicals, and the equipment in the process. This information is used to \nidentify and understand hazards posed by these chemicals and processes.\n\n- Process hazard analysis: Under our procedure for process hazard analysis, we \np"

Analyses are performed on both new and existing processes. Hazard analyses for \nregulated chemical storage include a review of material unloading, storage, and transfer \noperations.\n\n- Operating procedures: We have developed written procedures for the operation of \nall our processes. These procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting \nactivities involved with each covered process. These procedures are reviewed and \ncertified at least annually.  We also have written procedures for safe work practices \nto provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined\nspace entry; opening of process piping; and control over the entrance into the plant by \nsupport personnel.\n\n- Training: Every employee involved in operating a covered process is trained in the \nwritten operating procedures. The training includes specific safety and health hazards, \nemergency operating procedures, and safe work practices. Refresher training is \nprovided at least every three years.\n\n- Mechanical integrity: We have an extensive mechanical integrity program with \nwritten procedures to help ensure that our process equipment is inspected and \nmaintained. Employees with mechanical integrity responsibilities are trained to \nensure that they can perform their job tasks safely. \n\n- Management of change: We have a written management of change program to \nensure that changes to a covered process are adequately reviewed before they are \nimplemented. \n\n- Pre-startup safety review: Similar to management of change, we have a written \nprocedure for the review of new or significantly modified equipment, before that \nequipment is started up.

The \npurpose of these investigations is to determine the cause of the incident or near miss \nand to identity corrective actions which can help prevent a recurrence. \n\n- Hot work permit: We have a written procedure and permit for hot work operations \nwhich are conducted on or near a covered process. The procedure and permit are \nintended to ensure that the hot work is adequately reviewed before it starts and is \nmonitored during the operation.\n\n- Contractors: We have written procedures and policies regarding our use of \ncontractors in and around covered processes. These procedures are used to confirm \nthat contractor employees are adequately trained, have safe work practices, and have \nbeen informed of the potential hazards. \n\n- Employee participation: We encourage all our employees to actively participate in \nthe development and use of our accidental release prevention programs. \n\n- Compliance audits: We have a program in place to evaluate compliance with the \nRMP rule every three years to verify that the procedures and practices are adequate \nand are being followed.\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific \nprevention steps:\n\n- Control of emissions from production operations handling RMP chemicals\n- Vapor return for unloading of RMP chemicals to storage tanks\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to help prevent \naccidental chemical releases. \n\nIn addition to accidental release prevention, we have also implemented the following \nrelease mitigation steps:\n\n- Dikes around chemical storage tanks\n- Foam/water sprinkler systems throughout production buildings\n- Foam systems in flammable product and raw materials warehouses\n- Emergency communication and alarm system\n- Firewater monitors and fire hydrants\n- Fire extinguishers\n- Dedica"
