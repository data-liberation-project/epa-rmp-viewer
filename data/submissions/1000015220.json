      "SummaryText": "idental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Ruiz Foods - Denison facility is subject to both EPA's Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Under both of these programs, the facility has outlined specific procedures that it follows to prevent or minimize the release of anhydrous ammonia to the environment.  Specifically, the facility has performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the ammonia system and will repeat this process at least every 5 years.  The purpose of the PHA is to provide a systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling potential hazards associated with the ammonia system.  In addition, the facility performs regular training of its employees to ensure that the procedures developed for the safe use and handling of ammonia is adhered to all the time.  Finally, the facility has a regular inspection and maintenance program to ensure that the ammonia system is operated and maintained according to specific ammonia industry safety standards.  \n\nIt is Ruiz Foods' policy and belief that safe operating and maintenance practices and accident prevention programs are the key to obtaining safe operation and achieving accident prevention.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History Update\n\nAn investigation into the Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility\u00c2\u00bfs accident history revealed that the facility has had no reportable releases in the last five years (August 2005 \u00c2\u00bf August 2010).  However, there have been a few minor incidents, but no releases that have resulted in any injuries either on-site or off-site.  The incidents in the last five years are described below:\n\nMay 2008 Incident\nOn May 19, 2008, operators connected a hose to compressors RC-12 and RC-8 to blow down oil from the oil coolers.  When operators opened a valve, ammonia started leaking from a defective union/connection.  The valves were immediately closed and the problem was repaired.  An estimated two pounds of ammonia was released and no"

      "SummaryText": "injuries occurred.  To prevent this incident from re-occurring operators now check all parts when making a connection.\n\nAugust 2008 Incident\nOn August 2, 2008, an ammonia vapor leak occurred at the suction strainer on compressor RC-12.  The leak occurred as a result of a defective gasket on the device.  Personnel replaced the defective gasket with a new gasket.  An estimated one pound of ammonia was release during this event and no one was injured.\n\nOctober 2008 Incident\nOn October 23, 2008, employees smelled ammonia in the receiving area and notified operators of the situation.  The area was cleared as a precaution and to allow operators to search for the source of the leak.  The source of the odor was identified as a loose ferrule on the Cheese/Ingredient Cooler.  The ferrule was tightened and no further reports of ammonia odor were reported.  A minimal amount of ammonia was released and no injuries occurred.\n\nNovember 2008 Incident\nOn November 26, 2008, ammonia vapor was released as a result of a leaky coil in the Cold Kitchen Phoenix Unit #20.  The coil was fixed by operators to stop the leak.  An estimated five to ten pounds of ammonia was released and no injuries occurred as a result of the leaky coil.\n\nJanuary 2009 Incident\nThe most recent incident occurred on January 15, 2009.  Ammonia vapor was released from Condenser EC-7 due to a leak in a deteriorated condenser coil.  The condenser was isolated and the facility removed and replaced it with a new unit.  An estimated ten pounds of ammonia was released and no injuries occurred as a result of the condenser coil leak.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRuiz Foods has devised a comprehensive emergency response program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. The Ruiz Foods Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the assistance of local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, med"

It is the policy of Ruiz Foods to comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, and to conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any unreasonable adverse impact on the environment or its neighboring community.\n\nIn keeping with this policy, Ruiz Foods has developed and implemented OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management programs to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.  The Risk Management program includes procedures: (1) to identify potentially hazardous chemicals at the facility, (2) for maintaining a safe working environment and, thereby, help prevent the release of hazardous chemicals, and (3) for minimizing the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Ruiz Foods, Denison facility, makes tortillas, burritos and other Mexican food products.  The major processes at the facility include flour handling and storage, ingredient mixing, baking and product packaging and distribution.  Raw materials are delivered to this facility by trucks.\n\nThe only RMP regulated chemical handled by Ruiz Food at the Denison facility is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in the refrigeration system for making, cooling and freezing food products.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.   Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by supplier tank trucks to initially charge the system and occasionally thereafter to top-off the system if needed, to replenish from periodic maintenance.  \n\nRuiz has in place policies and procedures for handling the ammonia at the facility.  In addition, this facility complies with the ANSI/ASHRAE-15 Standard for ammonia refrigeration.  \n\n\nGeneral Acc"

The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan that documents specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as notification of the local emergency response agencies that are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed on September 13, 2005 and the following PHA Revalidation, performed on June 28 & 29, 2010, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Ruiz Food Products, Inc. facility located in Denison, Texas.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspections, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. The Ruiz Food Products, Inc.'s safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their  employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement Safety Plan Development.\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
