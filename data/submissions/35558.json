      "SummaryText": "Introduction\nThe Whiting Clean Energy, Inc facility located in Whiting, Indiana, a NiSource, Inc. subsidiary, operates a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system which utilizes anhydrous ammonia for reduction of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions. This anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 13,000-gallon storage tank located at the facility. At full capacity, the tank can store 57,140 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. Since the facility will be storing more than 10,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia, the storage of anhydrous ammonia is subject to United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations codified in 40CFR Part 68.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is an easily liquefiable colorless gas with a sharp, intensely irritating odor. It is listed by the USEPA as a regulated toxic substance for release prevention.\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR Part 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to anhydrous ammonia.  The facility completed a Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) for anhydrous ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed in April 2001 using technical and operations staff from the facility as well as experienced facilitators from URS Corporation, an outside consulting firm.\n\nWhiting Clean Energy, Inc. is committed to the safe operation of SCR anhydrous ammonia system at the WCE facility. Primary Energy Inc.?s implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plan includes preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for "

The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the systems. The PSM program also includes a program for the evaluation of contractors. \n\nThe PSM written program incorporates the WCE facility?s comprehensive emergency response plan in concert with the adjoining B. P. Amoco Whiting Refinery facility.  The PSM places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of ammonia and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations such as the Lake County LEPC.\n\nWhiting Clean Energy, Inc. completed a compliance audit of the PSM program in the third quarter of 2002. \n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, Whiting Clean Energy, Inc. undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases from the 13,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario/Alternative Release Scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario/alternative release scenario are presented in sections 3 and 4, respectively, of the Risk Management Plan.                                                                                           \n\nRelease Prevention Program\nAs indicated earlier, Primary Energy Inc. has proactively implemented an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program (codified in 29CFR Part 1910.119) for the SCR anhydrous ammonia process.  The scope of the PSM program encompasses "

      "SummaryText": "various facets of release prevention; e.g., it engenders employee participation, increases employee awareness about the hazards of handling anhydrous ammonia, establishes safe standard operating procedures and enhances access to process safety information. In April 2001, Primary Energy Inc. performed a HAZOP Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) on the SCR anhydrous ammonia system with the help of outside consultants in order to review operating procedures, equipment maintenance schedules, operational safeguards and identify action items to render the process safer. Following the PHA, the WCE facility developed a written PSM program with the help of outside consultants. The written PSM program provides the procedural backbone for safe operability functions (i.e., continual review of safe operating procedures, review of mechanical integrity of equipment, improved maintenance schedules, increased training, better access to process safety information and hazard awareness for both employees and onsite contractors, and effective emergency response planning), and allows Primary Energy Inc. to maintain, review and evaluate the program on a periodic basis.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThe SCR anhydrous ammonia process became operational in the first quarter of 2002. There is no operational history during which the WCE facility has experienced a release of anhydrous ammonia involving consequences that affected nearby residents or the environment. \n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe PSM written program incorporates the WCE facility?s comprehensive emergency response plan in concert with the adjoining B.

ER team members are drawn from the existing employee pool and the organizational concept fosters pride and emphasizes concerns for safe operation of the WCE facility. The well defined ER organization operates in conjunction with the B. P.
