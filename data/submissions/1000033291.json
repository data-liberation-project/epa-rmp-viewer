This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Panola II Gas Plant is located at 2539 County Road 301, Carthage in Panola County, Texas.  This facility is located at the global position of 32.192573? N and -94.266775? W, WGD84 datum.  Enterprise Products purchased the facility from Azure Midstream and assumed control of the Panola II Gas Plant on May 1, 2017.\n\n\n\nThe plant processes natural gas from various oil and gas production facilities in the vicinity.  The acid gas components (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) are removed from the gas using an amine unit. The sweetened gas is then dried using a glycol dehydrator.  The gas is further dried in molecular sieve dehydrators.  The dried gas is then routed to a cryogenic skid, in which the gas is expanded from higher pressure to lower pressure causing the natural gas liquids (NGL) to separate from the gas stream.  The NGLs are pumped into the NGL product pipeline.  \n\n\n\nThe cryogenic skid contains a 35,000 gal pressurized steel tank for product (NGL) storage.  The components of NGL (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane and pentane) are classified as regulated flammable substances and are present in the product in an amount greater than the threshold quantity o"

Less than 10,000 lbs of hydrogen sulfide is present in the inlet gas, and thus not included in the RMP registration.  \n\n\n\nDue to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the Panola II Gas Plant is registered as an EPA Risk Management Program 3 facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site, but no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the safety and accident prevention program in place at the Panola II Gas Plant.  The gas processing operations at the Panola II Gas Plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Panola II Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Panola II Gas Plant will promptly investigate any incidents that result in or reaso"

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develop recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forward these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Panola II Gas Plant has safety features and controls to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n*Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n*Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n*Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n*Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\n\n*Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n*Hand-held fire extinguishers\n\n*Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n*Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOver the past five years there have been no large or small releases which resulted in any injuries, property damage or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nThe Panola II Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs. Employee"

The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Panola II Gas Plant is coordinated with the Panola County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC). The Panola II Gas Plant has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Panola II Gas Plant will conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and will provide periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nEnterprise Products Operating, LLC is committed to the safe design and operation of all of its processing and fractionation plants and liquid hydrocarbon terminals and resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the storage and loading operations.  Additionally, employee recommendations to improve the safety of the storage and loading operations are reviewed and implemented if they are judged to be effective in improving terminal safety or reducing accident risk.  \n\n"
