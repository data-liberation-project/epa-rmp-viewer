The ammonia refrigeration facility, will occupy approximately 184,000 square feet and employ 68 personnel (also referred to as BI-LO Associates).  The purpose of the facility is to provide refrigeration of food products awaiting distribution to regional BI-LO Food Centers and Stores.  Anhydrous ammonia is the refrigerant material.  The maximum ammonia inventory available within the process piping is approximately 22,000 lbs.  The Facility is currently in the final construction phase. The Facility is expected to be in full operation by August 2000.   \n\nBI-LO is committed to operating the Facility in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of BI-LO and Contractor employees, the public and the environment.  In addition, BI-LO is committed to operating the Facility in full compliance with all applicable EPA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and South Carolina regulatory requirements.\n\nTo ensure that the Facility is operated in a safe manner and in compliance with applicable EPA regulations relevant to the prevention of accidental releases, BI-LO has developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP). The RMP was initiated sufficiently in advance of the facility construction and operation, in order to fully analyze the design and proposed operations in order to minimize impacts to workers, the public and the environs.  Among the important components of this RMP are BI-LO's system of policies and procedures for operation and maintenance of the facility,  BI-LO's Emergency Contingency Response Plan (ECRP) specific to this site, and the inherent safety features of the refrigeration process.\n\nBI-LO's commitment to the safety of the Facility, is evidenced in the designation of a senior BI-LO corporate manager, the Vice President of Construction and Mai"
