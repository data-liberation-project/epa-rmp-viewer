      "SummaryText": "The City of Aorora, Colorado, Utilities Department operates two drinking water treatmant plants which provide water to the 280,000 citizens of the City. Drinking water at these two facilities exceeds Federal and State standards. The water source for both treatment plants is pristine, high mountian lake water and City managed reservoirs. Wemlinger Water Treatment Plant was initially built in 1983 at a capacity of 40 million galllons per day. As of April, 2004 Wemlinger has completed its second expansion and presenly has a capacity of 80 million gallons per day.During the most recent expansion, from October 2002 to April 2004 the facility was updated to meet existing building, fire and electrical code, including the installation of a chlorine scrubber. Wemlinger produces an exceptional product.\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED-\n\nChlorine is handled in one-ton containers. Containers are housed in a dedicated storage area with a chlorine scrubber attached.Standard Operating Procedres require two banks of eight ton cylinders to be on-line when the plant is on-line.Ammonia is stored in a 8000 gallon underground storage tank. The tank and subsequent piping are double contained and alarmed. The room where the ammonia is fed has a ammonia vapor detector connected to an automatic shut-off valve.Wemlinger staff has received training from local emergency responders on procedure development and emergency response. Training drills have been staged with the Aurora Fire Department and Table top excercises performed with the EPA.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE-\n\nAn Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facility and is coordinated with the City of Aurora Fire Department, Aurora Police Department and the LEPC."
