Creighton Consulting has revised and updated this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the stationary ammonia refrigeration system at the Fresh Express facility located at 7505 Grayson Rd, Harrisburg, PA as part of the 5-year revalidation of the facility's current program. This revision was completed in May 2013.\r\nThis combined Program Level 3 RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) program was developed and submitted to comply with the following requirements:\r\n\u00bf\tAccidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), pursuant to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR) Part 68\r\n\u00bf\tOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\nPursuant to CFR 68.15, a management system has been developed for this RMP.  The Utility Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of RMP elements.  This position has direct supervisory responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  This position coordinates RMP implementation by interaction with the site's Safety and Risk Manager.  \r\n1.\tExecutive Summary\r\n1.1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe management of Fresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Security Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained a Quick Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \r\n1.2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 7505"

The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\r\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 17,416 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \r\n1.3.\tRelease Scenarios\r\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the single High Pressure Receiver (a maximum of 17,416 lbs) .  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.2 miles.\r\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia through a failed compressor housing.  The total volume of the refrigeration system (17,416 lbs of ammonia) was used for the release calculations.  The fact that the compressors are located indoors was considered in order to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\r\n1.4.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \r\nThis includes:\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\r\n\u00bf\tPerformance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHA's) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tImplementation of Operating Procedures which ha"

The broken pipe was replaced, tested and validated prior to being placed back in to service.  Guarding was placed under all air units to prevent a recurrence.
