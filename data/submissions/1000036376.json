      "SummaryText": "RMP Management System\n\nS. Creighton Consulting has revised and updated this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the stationary ammonia refrigeration system at the Fresh Express facility located at 7505 Grayson Rd, Harrisburg, PA as part of the 5-year revalidation of the facility's current program. This revision was completed in May 2013.\n\nThis combined Program Level 3 RMP and Process Safety Management (PSM) program was developed and submitted to comply with the following requirements:\n\n?    Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Programs under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), pursuant to Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40CFR) Part 68\n\n?    Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nPursuant to CFR 68.15, a management system has been developed for this RMP.  The Utility Manager has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of RMP elements.  This position has direct supervisory responsibility for the operations and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  This position coordinates RMP implementation by interaction with the site's Safety and Risk Manager.  \n\n1.    Executive Summary\n\n1.1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management of Fresh Express is committed to maintaining a safe work environment.  A Safety and Security Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained a Quick Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Fresh Express employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n\n1.2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Fresh Express plant covered by this RMP is located at 7505 "

The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\n\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  One fixed ammonia refrigeration system is used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 17,416 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n1.3.    Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario considered for this process is a release of the volume of the single High Pressure Receiver (a maximum of 17,416 lbs) .  No administrative controls and mitigation measures were considered to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 2.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario considered for this process is a release of ammonia through a failed compressor housing.  The total volume of the refrigeration system (17,416 lbs of ammonia) was used for the release calculations.  The fact that the compressors are located indoors was considered in order to limit the off-site consequence distance for this scenario.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\n1.4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at Fresh Express is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.  \n\nThis includes:\n\n?    Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\n\n?    Performance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHA's) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\n\n?    Implementation of Operating Procedures which ha"

Five-year Accident History\n\nBetween August 2008 (the previous revalidation of the site program) and the present, no ammonia releases resulted in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, property damage, sheltering in place or off-site environmental damage.  There were four small ammonia releases and one incident that resulted in an evacuation, outlined, below:\n\n01/02/2009 - The packing stem leaked at the relief valve area.  Less than 5 pounds of ammonia was release.  This did not require and evacuation or regulatory reporting.  The leak was fixed by tightening the packing stem on the valve.  \n\n01/12/2009 23:00 - There was an ammonia release from Evaporator (Air Unit) AU10 when a pipe was broken due to a strike from a forklift truck that was moving stackable bins.  A total of 2,500 pounds of ammonia was released over a four-hour period and the facility was evacuated.  The system shut down automatically.  The broken pipe was replaced, tested and validated prior to being placed back in to service.  Guarding was placed under all air units to prevent a recurrence.  All stackable bins were removed from the facility.  Regulatory agencies were notified of the release.  There were no offsite impacts or evacuations as a result of this incident.\n\n11/02/2010 - A flange leaked at the king valve.  Less than 5 pounds of ammonia was released.  This did not requir"

A contractor replaced the leaking plug.  \n\n1.6.    Emergency Response Program\n\nFresh Express has developed an Emergency Planning and Response document to ensure adequate preparedness with rapid and appropriate response to ammonia release emergencies.  The plan is maintained at the site's Safety and Security Manager office and is reviewed annually.  The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation procedures, and includes response procedures for the mitigation of ammonia releases. \n\nThe site has an Ammonia Quick Response Team trained to use the Incident Command System organizational framework.  This is also described in detail in the planning document.\n\n1.7.
