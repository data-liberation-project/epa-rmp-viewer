      "SummaryText": "The Earthgrains Company operates a commercial bakery facility in Paris, Texas. The facility makes various bread and snack cake products. Ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at the Facility for cooling portions of the building, making ice, and freezing products. Propane or LP-Gas is used as fuel when natural gas is not available. This facility complies with the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 15 for the ammonia refrigeration systems. The propane system is designed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state requirements. It is the policy of Earthgrains to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nEarthgrains has in place policies that limit the amount of ammonia and propane at the Facility. Additionally, Earthgrains has prevention and management programs that are implemented to increase the safe operation of both systems. Earthgrains believes that safe operation and accident prevention is the way to do business everyday.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving either of the ammonia systems or the propane system, it is Earthgrains policy to notify Paris Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. Earthgrains has discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the department have inspected the facility. In the past five years, the facility has not had an accident involving ammonia or propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe maximum amount of ammonia stored in System 1 is 20,000 pounds in the storage tank and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The worst-case scenario for ammonia is a failure of the storage tank and release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period. Based upon USEPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 1.7 miles. Approximately 361 people live within the 1.7 mile radius from the facility.

Using the EPA's look-up tables, the conservative distance to the endpoint is less than 0.1 miles.\nThe maximum amount of ammonia stored in System 2 is 15,000 pounds in the storage tank and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The worst-case scenario for ammonia is a failure of the storage tank and release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period. Based upon USEPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 1.5 miles. Approximately 203 people live within the 1.5 mile radius from the facility.
