Third Street in Grand Haven, Michigan.\n\n\n\nAs required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act Risk Management Program contained in 40 CFR Part 68, this document contains information intended to prevent and minimize the impacts or accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances.  The intent of the rule is to reduce the likelihood of a chemical release and the consequences of a release if one were to occur. \n\n\n\nThe water treatment process at the Grand Haven BLP uses chlorine which is a regulated substance. The BLP has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine, which surpasses the EPA threshold of 2,500 pounds. The facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Modeling results indicate the worst-case release would cause an offsite impact. Due to these factors, Grand Haven BLP is subject to Program 3 requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, Grand Haven BLP has not had an accidental release that met the criteria of 40 CFR Part 68. \n\n\n\nBecause of the potential hazards when using chlorine, it is of paramount importance that steps be taken to minimize the risk of a catastrophic release.  Consequently, to minimize the risk of release, Grand Haven BLP has in place a Prevention Program that is based on the following four (4) key elements:\n\n\n\n1. Grand Haven BLP has purchased, installed, and maintains high-quality process and monitoring equipment used for the water treatment activity.\n\n\n\n2. Grand Haven BLP has developed plans and programs to ensure safe operation of the system.\n\n\n\n3. Grand Haven BLP has provided process information and training to affected employees, and requires contractors working on or in the immediate area of the chlorine to verify knowledge of training and Grand Haven BLP's procedures.\n\n\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "dits to ensure adherence to plans and programs as well as to continue the minimization of risk.\n\n\n\nTo predict the offsite impact in the event of an emergency, a hazard analysis was conducted according to the procedures outlined in the rule.  Due to the changes made to the reporting requirements of the RMP, the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) has been removed from this summary. Both OCAs can, however, be found within the RMP itself.\n\n\n\nGrand Haven BLP has been actively involved in emergency response planning for many years. The BLP has worked closely with the Ottawa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) over many years. Grand Haven BLP is a Program 3 source and a non-responding facility.  The Grand Haven BLP Emergency Response Plan outlines procedures for internal response to incidental releases and notification and coordination with the local emergency response organizations in the event of an incidental release which cannot be contained and will have off-site impacts.\n\n\n\nLastly, Grand Haven BLP intends to no longer use Chlorine by December 2019 and the facility will be dismanteled starting June 2020."
