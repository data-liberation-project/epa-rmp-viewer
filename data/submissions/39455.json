      "SummaryText": "ASARCO Incorporated (Asarco) owns and operates a copper refinery and precious metals recovery plant at its Amarillo Copper Refinery (ACR), in Potter County, Amarillo, Texas.  Through the copper refining process, impurities such as gold, silver, nickel sulfate, and other by-products are recovered.  The process consists of electrolytic refining in which copper is separated from other metals by passing an electric current through a solution of copper sulfate and sulfuric acid.  Further processing steps lead to the recovery and refinement of other metals.\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to ACR because the plant handles and stores hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1. Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause, ?112(r)(1), is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Asarco is committed to ensuring the safe operation of ACR, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Asarco, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for the plant and for the community by coordinating with the Amarillo/Potter/Randall Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The copper refinery and precious metals recovery plant at ACR involves the handling and storage of two chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in ?112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of ?112(r), Asarco management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide.
