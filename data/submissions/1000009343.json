As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible. To accomplish this elements have been organized in a way that is consistent with the corporate organization, how frequently different elements are accessed, and who needs to refer to the program.  The order of elements within this organization is not the same as they are listed in the regulations, and in some cases portions of elements may be found in more than one location.   \n\n1.

The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2.    PROCESS DESCRIPTIONS\nThe Giumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage facility is a processing facilty for potatos and a cold storage facility for potatos and table grapes.  The facility has two ammonia processes that provide refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms, two chlorination processes that provide water treatment to the potato processing area, and two sulfur-dioxide storage areas for SO2 cylinders used for table grape fumigation in all of the cold rooms.\n\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n3.1 General.\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of any one of the regulated chemicals in annual pre-season safety meetings.  These employees are made aware of the potential risks of the process chemicals involved.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nGiumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for each process.  These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of the analysees are reported in the body of the program.\n\n3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia.\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  Giumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage facility are an integral part of the overall business and operate most of the year.   The north system contains a total charge of approximately 28,400 lbs and the south system contains approximately 54,000 lbs. It is extremely important that these systems are maintained and operated in a safe and efficie"

      "SummaryText": " Packing & Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  The overhaul of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with Giumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operators have assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, Giumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a A?living documentA?.  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Giumarra Vineyards, Packing & Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
