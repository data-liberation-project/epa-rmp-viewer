      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis executive summary is a brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at the Moorhead Water Treatment Plant, owned and operated by the City of Moorhead Public Service.  It contains the information called for in Section 68.155 of the rule.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe accidental release prevention policies are represented in Sections 2 through 13.  The emergency response policy is represented in Sections 14.  Moorhead Public Service takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at this facility by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of processes subject to the Part 68 rule.  They are also trained in the safe handling of all chemicals that are regulated substances under the rule.\n\nIn addition to ensure the adequate training of its employees, Moorhead Public Service works to prevent accidents by providing and revising as needed written procedures for operating its covered processes under the rule.  Although these procedures in and of themselves should prevent accidental releases, Moorhead Public Service maintains and follows a policy of compliance audits, the goals of which are to determine if existing procedures are adequate and, if they are, to ensure that they are followed.\n\nMoorhead Public Service has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  The general safety rules fall under Minnesota's Chapter 182 Occupational Safety and Health Act.  The safety and health program is required to meet Minnesota's Workplace Accident and Incident Reduction (AWAIR) Law. This program covers topics such as personal protection equipment, hazard communications, confined space, respiratory protection, excavation and trenching, lock-out/tag-out, and bloodborne disease exposure control.  Although these general rules do not specifically address the covered processes and their regulated substances, compliance with the general"

      "SummaryText": " rules will significantly reduce the potential for accidental release of these substances.  The manuals for this program are available to all Moorhead Public Service employees in the control room of the Moorhead Water Treatment Plant. \n\nAs for emergency response, Moorhead Public Service's procedure for a release is to notify the Moorhead Fire Department. The City of Moorhead Fire Department and the City of Fargo, North Dakota Fire Department jointly operate and maintain a HAZMAT team. Moorhead Public Service has established and maintained procedures for emergency evacuation of employees and accounting for them. These procedures will assist the HAZMAT team in perform their duties more efficiently. The procedures are reviewed with employees on an annual basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nMoorhead Public Service modeled two release scenarios in 2009: a worst case release scenario and an alternate case release scenario. In the worst case release scenario, EPA defined parameters were used with the local three-year maximum temperature and average  relative humidity. The radius of the chlorine plume was 2.6 miles and had a potential population impact of 53,436 in Moorhead and surrounding communities. For the alternate release scenario, a leaky ton cylinder on a deliver truck was modeled. This release reached 134 yard and off of the site. The residential population impacted was zero, but employee at the site would be affected.   \n\nMoorhead Public Service management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment at this facility and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in this document.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Moorhead WTP treats surface water from the Red River and ground water from two aquifers to provide drinking water to the community.  It does this through a series of physi"

The design capacity of the treatment plants is 16 million gallons per day.\n\nThe regulated substance stored, handled, and used at this facility is chlorine. The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 4 containers on site.  All of the containers are stored inside of a building.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR COVERED CHEMICALS\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in Section 2 through Section 13 of this document.  In accordance with the Part 68 rule, the prevention program contains the following sections:\n\n  >Employee participation\n  >Process safety information\n  >Process hazard analysis\n  >Operating procedures\n  >Personnel training\n  >Contractor safety\n  >Prestartup safety review\n  >Mechanical Integrity\n  >Hot work permits\n  >Management of change\n  >Incident investigation\n  >Compliance audits\n\nThe prevention program elements that are most critical in preventing accidental releases in this facility include employee training, both formal and on-the-job; written operating procedures for all to use who operate or maintain the covered processes; and a process equipment preventive maintenance program.\n\nShould the prevention program fail to prevent a release, the WTP is equipped with engineering controls designed to minimize the effect of the release to the surrounding community.  The chlorine containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of the release.  But more important, the plant has installed a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container onsite.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed"

      "SummaryText": " during a chlorine release. In addition, an automatic shutdown system for the online ton cylinder tank valves is installed. Upon room detector activation, the shutdown system will close the valves, reducing the impact of a leak. Our WTP also has a 500 kW generator for back-up power for the chlorine scrubber.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of regulated substances from this facility during the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency evacuation procedure for employees. The emergency response to a chlorine release is coordinated by local response agencies, such as the Moorhead Fire Department, which is part of the local HAZMAT team along with the City of Fargo, North Dakota. There are no employees at Moorhead Public Service either trained or designated as emergency responders for the chlorine system. The Emergency Planning and Response documentation kept by the facility is described in detail in Section 14 of this document.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of a release. The overall prevention program and onsite safety equipment are designed to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  A copy of the facility OSHA PSM and EPA RMP program is located at the Moorhead Fire Department for review.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVED SAFETY\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee safety meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at this facility. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nIn 2009, new chlorine detectors are being considered for installation. The detectors would output an analog signal to the control system. Consequently, a chlorine gas concentration re"

Operating personnel will have better information for assessment and decision making in the event of a chlorine release after the new analyzers are installed. In 2009, the facility conducted a PHA. Nearly all of the suggestions are either in effect or schedule to be completed. One of the significant changes will be the implementation of automated shutdown capabilities for the facility and offsite computer control for operating personnel. \n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation was considered and evaluated for implementation. The recommendation for the installation of an auto tank valve shutdown system was implemented. The system was installed in 1999. The hazard review process provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process.\n\n"
