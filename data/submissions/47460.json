December 20, 2006\n\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the EQUISTAR ? Channelview Plant (CVON) we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes to protect our employees, the public, and the environment.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure continued operations with protection in environmental, health and safety (EHS) protection in mind.  This document provides a  brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent or eliminate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance, however, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release.   We are also coordinated with the Houston area?s Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\nChlorine was removed from the cooling towers effective 12/18/2006, and replaced with a 10% bleach solution for the prevention and control of biological organism growth.  We still utilize an internal standard of 0.5 ? 1.0 ppm free chloride in our cooling towers as found in the bleach solution.  The removal of Chlorine from our cooling towers prompted this change in our RMP submission.\n\n\n2.0    Stationary Source  and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility cracks Naptha, OP-400, and Algerian condensates into a number of products that include 1,3-Butadiene, Isobutylene/Butene, Isoprene, Propylene, Isobutane and other olefins.  In addition, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) and an assortment of products are produced in the East Plant / Mid Plant unit, including Isopropanol.  There are two Olefins Cracking units and one East Pla"

These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identifed by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of their substantial accidental release:\n\n\nToxics - NONE\n\n\nFlammables\n\nPropylene: Approximately 1,500,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propylene is refined in the Olefins.\n\nOlefins Condensate: Approximately 129 million lbs. of mixed condensate feedstocks, intermediates, and products are present within the Olefins process units and in the tank farm area.  The condensates include Algerian, OP-400, and Naptha condensate materials, depending in most part to the supplier.  \n\n\nIsobutylene: Approximately 1.1 million lbs. are contained in storage and within the East Plant process unit.  Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of MTBE.\n\n1,3-Butadiene: Approximately 3.5 million pounds of Butadiene are stored and in process within the East Plant.  Butadiene is further utilized on the Poly-Butadiene process within the Mid Plant as well as sold as a finished product.\n\nN-Butane: Approximately 1.3 million lbs. are contained in storage and within the East Plant process unit.  N-Butane is an intermediate chemical and is sent to the Olefins Cracking Units for further processing.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\nRegulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nWorst-Case Scenario ? Olefins Condensate Storage Tank (Flammable Mixture)\n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammables assumes the complete rupture of the isobutylene surge drum, releasing 26,620,000 lbs. of this flammable mixture into a diked area, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure.  The overpressure would extend beyond the fenceline 2.4mi. And affect approximately 11,000 people.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario ? Propylene\n\nTh"

The scenario also assumes that the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and that all active safety systems fail.  The total release would be approximately 800,000 lbs. of Propylene, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure.  The over pressure would not be contained on-site, traveling for 0.5 miles.  The total affected population would be approximately 600 people.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEQUISTAR Chemicals ? Channelview Operations (CVON) has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  Addiitonally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards as well as is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 ? Process Safety Management.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to operating personnel.\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage, with the overall thougth of identifying and mitigating HSE issues before installation or operation.  Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any SOP training opportunity.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified after completed of a process PHA.  Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a pro"
