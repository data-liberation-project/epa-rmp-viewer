This Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR 68.155.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Cedar WTF implements a scheduled preventive maintenance program, including inspection and testing, to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable employees to perform their work safely and efficiently.\n\nThe Cedar WTF staff are trained only to manage incidental releases related to maintenance and operation activities and the facility is considered a non-responding facility per 40 CFR 68.90. Emergency response to accidental releases is coordinated with the local fire department and State and local emergency response agencies.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Cedar WTF utilizes chlorine (regulated substance) as a disinfectant in the drinking water treatment process. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as well as written process safety information has been developed to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by processes involving an EHS or highly hazardous chemical (HHC). Process safety information includes chlorine information, technology of the process information, and equipment information.\n\nThe Utility Engineers verified during the design build phase of the plant that the facility complies with applicable codes and standards and with recog"

All employees involved in working with and around the chlorine system are trained in process and safety procedures.\n\nThe mechanical integrity of chlorine process equipment is documented and maintained through maintenance, inspection, and testing programs. In addition, a Management of Change program has been established to ensure proper review of a proposed change to the chlorine system.\n\nA pre-startup safety review is performed on new or modified processes to ensure that equipment and construction meet design specifications, procedures and training have been implemented, and hazard analysis recommendations are resolved prior to start-up.\n\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been implemented. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a strong Risk Management Program is maintained, implemented, and followed by personnel. \n\nStaff have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP/PSMP. \n\nCedar WTF management staff are committed to involving employees in supporting the elements of the RMP/PSMP.

Involve employees in an incident investigation\n\nAn authorization and permit program for hot work operations near or around the regulated chlorine and processes has been implemented at the WTF. \n\nContractors performing maintenance or repair on or adjacent to chlorine processes are instructed in the hazards of the materials on site and documentation is maintained on contractor understanding of training provided as described in the RMP/PSMP. In addition, emphasis is placed on knowing evacuation procedures in the event of emergency. \n\nThe WTF chlorine system technologies are not confidential and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP/PSMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nNo accidents that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage involving chlorine systems have occurred at the facility in the past 5 years. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RMP/PSMP Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the Cedar WTF includes procedures to evacuate or shelter-in-place. The Cedar WTF is considered a non-responding facility whose employees will not respond to an accidental release of chlorine. The Renton Regional Fire Authority would respond to accidental releases of chlorine. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include conducting a review of RMP/PSMP elements on an annual basis, Hazard Communication training on an annual basis, establishment of a Safety Committee, conduct quarterly Safety Team meetings, and discussions of RMP/PSMP topics in quarterly Safety Team meetings.
