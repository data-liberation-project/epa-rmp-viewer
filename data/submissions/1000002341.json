This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Tampa Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00c2\u00bfs primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products. We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Chlorine, and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous).The Sulfur Dioxide and Chlorine are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 42,000 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), is present at our facility in quantities of 15,000 lbs.\n3.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA STANDARD 30-1996).  \nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified"
