This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Todhunter Terminal's RMP regulated activity is the processing (fractionation and dehydration), storage, and loading of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  We have three (3) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances are propane [CAS# 74-98-6], butane [CAS# 106-97-8], and ethyl mercaptan [ethanethiol, CAS# 75-08-1].  Pure propane and butane is received by pipeline for storage and redelivery either by pipeline (propane and butane) or by truck (propane only).  Unregulated gasoline products are also received by pipeline for storage at and redelivery from the facility.  Ethyl mercaptan is used to odorize the propane that is delivered from the facility by truck for safety purposes  \r\n\r\nMixed interface liquid volumes (propane/butane, propane/gasoline or butane/gasoline) from the inlet pipelines are stored in an underground mined cavern.  From time to time, these mixed LPG and gasoline liquids are sent to a fractionation unit to separate the propane, butane and gasoline back into relatively pure components for storage and redelivery..  The butane portion of the LPG is returned to cavern storage, and the gasoline is sent to storage tanks.  The underground caverns are"

The calculated amount of propane contained in the fractionation process vessels is below the threshold quantity for reporting under the RMP Regulation.   \r\n  \r\nAll three compounds are classified as flammable under 40 CFR Part 68.  No compounds classified as toxic are stored or used at the facility in amounts above their threshold quantities.  The maximum on-site inventory of propane, butane and mercaptan subject to regulation under 40 CFR Part 68 at any one time is detailed in the RMP submission.  For RMP regulatory purposes, the unregulated gasoline included with the regulated compounds in the feed and product from the fractionation unit is reported as pentane.  Unregulated jet fuel is also received, stored and delivered from Todhunter terminal, but this exempt product is not mixed with or processed with the covered flammable substances.\r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Todhunter Terminal.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.
