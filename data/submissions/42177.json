The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn in a dry mill process. Dry \ndistiller grains are produced as a by-product and are used as a livestock feed. Pro-Corn completed \na facility modifications that doubled their current ethanol production. This facility modification does \nnot change the current method of production. The modification requires additional storage capacity \nfor process chemicals. The additional storage capacity exceeds the threshold quantities of six RMP\nlisted substances. Five of the listed chemicals are present in the denaturant, used to denature the \nfinal ethanol product. The denaturant storage capacity is approximatly 500,000 pounds and \nincludes the following chemicals; 1-Butene, Butane, isobutene pentane, and isopentane and the \nreported respective concentrations of 3%, 8%, 5%, 28% and 24%. The facility modification also \ntriggered the storage capacity for anhydrous ammonia. The new storage volume will be approximatly \n193,000 pounds. The new storage volume includes the volume of a separate and significantly smaller\nammonia tank that is used to supply anhydrous ammonia to the carbon dioxide plant.  \n\nPrevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nPro-Corn has complied with the requirements of 40 CFR part 68. As a Program 3 facility, Pro-Corn \nmaintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan. The PSM plan requires facilities to monitor \ncovered pro"
