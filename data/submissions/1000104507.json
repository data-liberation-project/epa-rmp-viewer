We manufacture flexible polyurethane foam into prime, rebond and molded foam products.  In addition, we blend polyurethane systems for use by other end product manufacturers.  In our process, we use the following chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nToluene Diisocyanate (Mixed Isomers)\tCAS No.:  26471-62-5\r\n\r\nWe have storage capacity for approximately 307,700 gallons of TDI inside the plant in fourteen (14) bulk tanks located in tank pits or diked tank farms.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems provide and have integrated these standards into the way we do business.  We also have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\r\n \r\n\r\n5.2.4\tFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nWe will keep records for all significant accidental releases that occur at our facility.
