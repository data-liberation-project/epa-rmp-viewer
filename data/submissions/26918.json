      "SummaryText": "The Holcim (US) Inc. facility in Artesia, Mississippi, conducted a comprehensive applicability determination for the Risk Management Program (RMP) (40 CFR Part 68) regulations.  It was determined that the RMP regulations applied since the facility has received an RMP regulated Toxic Chemical since August, 1996 in quantities that exceed the threshold level.  The facility manages hazardous waste derived fuels which are used to replace fossil fuel consumption in the manufacture of Portland cement.  The facility has decided to prepare and submit a RMP Plan to maintain future operational flexibility.\n\nThe Toxic Chemical Vinyl Acetate monomer was selected to be addressed in the RMP Plan preparation based on the applicability determination.  The process involved at the facility includes handling, storage and blending in tanks and transfers from containers such as tank trucks and railcars.  The facility was not eligible for prevention Program Level 1 since screening level modeling, using highly conservative assumptions, showed potential for offsite consequences owing to the proximity to other industrial sites and offices.  The facility is not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations or one of the nine designated SIC codes and thus excluded from Prevention Level 3.  Consequently, the facility was deemed to be under Prevention Program Level 2.  This submission is predictive in nature since the subject chemical is not always on-site.\n\nThe worst-case Off-site Consequence Analysis scenario involved a potential release of pure chemical from one of the facility's Blend Tanks.  The general accidental release prevention program includes tanks that are contained in a concrete tank farm dike that has sufficient capacity to contain the entire volume of a possible release from the largest tank and minimize the evaporation rate of the chemical.  In addition, the unloading area has doors which can be closed to reduce chemical vapor dispersion in the event of a relea"

      "SummaryText": "se in that area, and the unloading area and tank farm are both protected by a vapor suppressing foam system to minimize vaporization of the potential release.  The general release prevention steps for normal operations are adequate for the registered RMP chemical.\n\nHolcim management is committed to safe operations at the facility.  The company has an Environment, Health and Safety Policy that clearly commits company resources to maintaining safe operations protective of human health and the environment.  The facility also has an active Community Advisory Committee to provide an avenue for discussing health, safety and environmental issues with our neighbors.\n\nThe facility has had no incidents involving the release of vinyl acetate in the past 5 years.  No additional changes to the site's safety systems are required or anticipated to allow continued handling of this chemical.\n\nAlthough the facility is exempt from the OSHA PSM regulations, the management voluntarily implemented portions of the standards when the hazardous waste storage tank farm was built.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted in January, 1999.  The facility meets or exceeds the Prevention Program Level 2 requirements for Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits and Accident Investigation.\n\nThe facility is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as a commercial hazardous waste treatment and storage facility.  The existing Contingency Plan meets or exceeds the RMP regulatory requirements for the written Emergency Plan.  Local Emergency planning agencies have been cognizant of the facility activities, reviewed the Contingency Plan and agreed in writing to provide assistance in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe Holcim management welcomes inquiries into our operations, and looks forward to answering any questions that the public may have.  Please contact the emergency contact identified in this plan if you have any question"
