This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive  accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances (ammonia).  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated the local Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for emergency response support.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Peco Foods, Inc. processing operations.  Due to the  and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this Peco Foods location is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nPeco Foods, Inc. has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements, Peco Foods, Inc. has implemented their Process Safety Management Program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at this Peco Foods location within the last five years that have resulted in on-site or off-site property damage, injuries, or deaths.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY "

Our facility has a trained HAZMAT response team that will respond to most releases below the 1000 ppm threshold.  Peco Foods has coordinated with the local Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) such that they can lend assistance if needed during an emergency.  Specific actions to be taken by Peco Personnel are outlined in the written facility Emergency Action Plan on hand at this facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nIn order to protect our community, personnel, property, and customers, Peco Foods, Inc. constantly strives to improve the safety of our refrigeration system.  This is accomplished by adherence to all OSHA, EPA, State, and Local regulations, as well as following Recommended and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP) as they become available.
