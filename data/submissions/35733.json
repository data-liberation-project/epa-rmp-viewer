Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous and liquid hydrogen.  Natural gas and steam are used in the manufacturing process to produce hydrogen. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in processing part of the gaseous hydrogen stream and also to liquefy carbon dioxide at the facility.  Liquid Chlorine is used for cooling water treatment, specifically as a biocide.  Ammonia, chlorine, and the flammable mixture used to produce hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit. \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nOne of the principal purposes of this facility is to manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  This facility manufactures liquid and gaseous hydrogen.

      "SummaryText": "rocesses. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock. The feedstock is mixed with steam and sent to the reformer furnace. In the reformer furnace, the feedstock and steam are heated in the presence of a catalyst to approximately 1,500 degrees F, where a chemical reaction takes place that converts the mixture into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are than separated from the hydrogen. The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to our customers via pipeline or sent to a liquefier where the gas is cooled and stored as a liquid for delivery to our customers via tank truck. \n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is used to cool part of the gaseous hydrogen stream to control the dewpoint and in the production of liquid carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide is a by product of the hydrogen production process).\n\nLiquid Chlorine is used for cooling water treatment, specifically as a biocide.  The chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers, two of which are located on site.\n\n \n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility comlpies with the Federal EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The design  and construction of the facility complies with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of flammable gas,chlorine, or ammonia that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n \n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility?s emergency response program is based upon OSHA?s HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from the LEPC and outside agencies.  They have been trained to O"

Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHA?s and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."
