              "Description": "SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nXTO compiles and maintains the following up-to-date safety information related to the regulated substances, processes, and equipment at the Site: \n\n?    Safety Data Sheets that meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) \n\n?    Maximum intended inventory of equipment in which the regulated substances are stored or processed \n\n?    Safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows, and compositions  \n\n?    Equipment specifications \n\n?    Codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process. \n\n\n\nXTO ensures that the process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. Additionally, XTO updates the safety information if a major change occurs that makes the information inaccurate. \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of required information for Program 2 prevention programs per 29 CFR ? 68.  XTO and Kinder Morgan standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been implemented to cover this required information as described in the table below. \n\n29 CFR Number    CFR Section Title    Company Responsible \n\nfor SOP\n\n\n\n? 68.48    Safety Information     XTO\n\n? 68.50    Hazard Review             XTO\n\n? 68.52    Operating Procedures     Kinder Morgan\n\n? 68.54    Training             Kinder Morgan\n\n? 68.56    Maintenance             Kinder Morgan\n\n? 68.58    Compliance Audits     XTO\n\n? 68.60    Incident Investigation     XTO\n\n\n\n&#8195;\n\nHAZARD REVIEW\n\n\n\nXTO conducts a review of the hazards associated with the regulated substances, process, and procedures that identifies the following: \n\n?    The hazards associated with the process and regulated substances \n\n?    Opportunities for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release \n\n?    The safeguards used or needed to control the hazards or prevent equipment malfunction or human error \n\n?    Any steps used or needed to detect or monitor releases.\n\n\n\nXTO documents the results of this review and ensures that problems identified are resolved in a timely manner. The review is updated at least once every five years, or when a major change in the process occurs, whichever occurs first. All issues identified in the review are resolved prior to startup of the changed process. \n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nPersonnel newly assigned to the Site must be trained on the operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices applicable to the employee?s tasks.  Employees are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a major change. Refresher training must be provided at least every three years.  Training documentation that includes the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training must be maintained for each employee.\n\n\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\n\n\nProcedures to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment are in place for the Site. Employees involved in maintaining the equipment are provided appropriate training in the hazards of the process, in how to avoid or correct unsafe conditions, and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks. Maintenance contractors shall ensure that each contract maintenance employee is trained to perform the maintenance procedures. Process equipment is inspected and tested using procedures that follow recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. The frequency of inspections and tests of process equipment shall be consistent with applicable manufacturers' recommendations, industry standards or codes, good engineering practices, and prior operating experience. \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\n\n\nIncidents that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance will be investigated by XTO. A catastrophic release is one that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment. If the event meets the requirements for inclusion in the five-year accident history section of the RMP, it warrants an investigation. Incident investigations should be conducted on as needed, based for events that occur during operations of the Site. The following steps should be followed during the incident investigation process:\n\n?    Initiate an investigation immediately. \n\n-    Begin no later than 48 hours following the incident.\n\n?    Summarize the investigation in a report. The report must contain the following items:\n\n-    The factors that contributed to the incident \n\n-    Recommendations for corrective actions.\n\n?    Address the report?s findings and recommendations.\n\n-    Establish a system to address promptly and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations, and document resolutions and corrective actions. \n\n?    Review the report with employees and contractors.\n\n-    The report, including the findings and recommendations, must be shared with affected workers whose job tasks are relevant to the incident.\n\n?    Retain the report for five years.\n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Site conducts a compliance audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. The next compliance audit should be performed by December 2017. A representative from the operating contractor, XTO field operations, and a third party participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \n\nIncidents that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of regulated substances must be investigated as promptly as possible, no later than 48 hours following the incident.  A report must be prepared at the conclusion of the investigation that includes the date of the incident, the date the investigation began, a description of the incident, factors that contributed to the incident, and any recommendations resulting from the investigation.  Resolutions and corrective actions must be documented, and the report must be reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings.  Incident investigation reports must be retained for five years (40 CFR ?68.60).  \n\nIncident investigations should be conducted on as needed, based on events that occur during operations of the Site. Incidents that warrant investigation include, but are not limited to, near miss and/or injury to personnel or the public, repairs requiring capital expenditure that are not part of normal maintenance, loss of pressurization, over-pressurization, significant change in product quality, and operational anomaly requiring shut-in. Each incident investigation should be logged in the prevention program, and the detailed results filed here. \n\n",

(XTO) has a strong commitment to the protection of workers and the environment.  The North Lansing Site (the Site) has an active safety program covering both employees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to prevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO recognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including personnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of all operating units and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment is also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls have been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to provide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is present at the Site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Site is located near the southwestern corner of the intersection of Farm-to-Market (FM) 449 and FM 2208 approximately 7 miles southeast of Harleton, Texas in Harrison County. The Site neither uses nor stores any regulated toxic substance above RMP threshold quantities (40 CFR ? 68.130). Inherent with the operation of a gas refrigeration site, the Site processes and stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable substances are addressed throughout the RMP, and may include pentane, ethane, propane, and butane, which are all components of the Natural Gas Liquids Product (NGLP). \n\n\n\nG"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by XTO personnel with maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise of this type of facility. XTO personnel analyze and evaluate hazards of the processes, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and make suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when such measures are determined to be necessary.\n\n\n\nHazard analysis findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by XTO personnel.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to XTO personnel's hazard analysis findings are tracked until completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and when equipment or operating procedures change, and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n&#8195;\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Site has safety features on many units to help"

Any such valve that fails a test will be replaced or repaired and tested annually until reliability is ensured.\n\n-    Baseline ultrasonic testing thickness testing of the bullet tank will be performed prior to startup.\n\n-    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters.\n\n-    Atmospheric relief devices.\n\n?    Release mitigation\n\n-    Fire extinguishing devices. \n\n-    The local fire department has been notified about the potential hazards of the Site and has been provided the emergency response plan.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, XTO has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refrigeration Site operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, XTO management verifies that the XTO personnel are competent to operate the equipment. After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nThe Site has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief a"

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nEmployees receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits, such as adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs by the supplier. The supplier is responsible for ensuring that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nThe Site has implemented safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel by use of locks held by qualified contractors and employees, (2) lockout/tagout guidelines to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing ma"

These, and other guidelines, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, the Site has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases, with no RMP-reportable incidents.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Site maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as to protect the environment. The program consists of procedures for contacting responders for mitigation of a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address aspects of emergency response by outside experts, and include proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and any decontamination requirements. Employees receive appropriate training in procedures necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties which includes contacting trained responders. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Site processes or other facilities within the Site. The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel of the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Site is coordinated with the Harrison Coun"

The Site contacts local emergency responders annually with regard to the hazards of regulated substances at the Site. Annual Tier II Chemical Inventory filings are provided to the LEPC which detail the hazardous chemicals at the Site.\n\n\n\nXTO has implemented an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), elements of which overlap those of the RMP.  The ERP provides the following information:\n\n?    Procedures for informing the public and offsite emergency response officials of a release. \n\n-    The individuals and groups contacted, the means by which they will be contacted, the time frame for notification, and the information that will be provided is included in the ERP.\n\n?    The proper procedures for first aid and medical treatment for employees, first responders, and members of the public exposed to a release.\n\n-    Safety precautions for injured parties and detailed information for medical professionals\n\n-    Information regarding who is likely responsible for providing appropriate treatment (e.g., an employee, an employee with specialized training, or a medical professional).\n\n?

However, there is a system in place to investigate any incident that could result, or could reasonably result in, a fire/explosion, flammable gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of an investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution. Corrective actions potentially taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented, and the investigation results reviewed with all employees and contractors who could be affected by the findings. Any incident investigation reports will be retained for five years and will be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Site conducts an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are to be conducted at least every three years. A representative from the operating contractor, XTO field operations, and a third party participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.
