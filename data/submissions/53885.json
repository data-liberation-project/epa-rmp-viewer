      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for Imperial St. Facility\n\nArgo Chemical Inc. engages if the business of providing chemicals to end-users. Its warehouse and storage facility located at 30933 Imperial St. Shafter, California, stores various chemicals for resale. The chemicals are purchased from Manufacturers or their representatives, brought to the Argo Chemical facility, unloaded, stored, blended and reloaded for shipment to the customer. The following are key elements of the RMP plan:\n\n(a)  Argo chemical is a retail operation subject to the OSHA Process Standard. Argo Chemical incorporates all the elements of the Program 3 Prevention program, worst-case scenario analysis, alternative release analysis, 5-year history, document management system, process safety information, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audit, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permits and emergency response plan.\n\n(b)  The stationary sources and the regulated substances handled are:\n\nCompressed Anydrous ammonia:\nArgo chemical handles this product in 3-15,000 gallon pressurized tanks. Bulk shipments of Anhydrous ammonia are received by pressurized transport and unloaded directly into the ammonia storage tank battery. Anhydrous ammonia is used on site to produce Aqua ammonia, and for delivery in smaller quantity.\n\nAqua ammonia:\nThis product, handled in bulk, is stored in three 45,000 gallon tanks, one tank at 19%, another at 24.5%, and a third at 29.4%. It is loaded into shipping containers using pumps and hoses with vapor return to the vessel from which the product is being removed.\n\n?  In the unlikely event (worst-case scenario) that something happens to one of the tanks of Aqua ammonia and the entire contents of the tank are released in 10 minutes; an alternate scenario is the release of 3,700lbs in 10 minutes. In the case of Anhydrous ammonia, the worst-case scenario is the release of the entire contents of one 15,000-gallon tank in 10"

      "SummaryText": " minutes; an alternate scenario is the release of 2,700lbs in 15 minutes. The entire Anhydrous ammonia and Aqua ammonia handling facility has a water deluge sys tem capable of delivering 100 gallons per minute of water in a form of a spray covering the ammonia plant and storage area in its entirety.\n\n(d)  Argo Chemical has in place an accidental release prevention program, which, among others, includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Instructions, Compliance Audits and Training.\n\n(e)  Argo Chemical has an Emergency Response Plan and coordinates its activities with all applicable Governemtal Agencies.\n\n(f)  Argo Chemical is committed to safe and responsible distribution of chemical products. Operating Procedures, review and enhanced training of personnel in the safe handling of all chemical products is a continuing practice of Argo Chemical, Inc. Forklift operations and truck-loading training is an ongoing process. As technology and operation changes occur, additional training and improvement in loading equipment is implemented."
