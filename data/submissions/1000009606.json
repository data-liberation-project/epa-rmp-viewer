Prior to that change NOCS had struggled to stay current and up to date with compliance objectives.\n \nUnder new owner our safety objectives will be met as well as adherence to all applicable federal, state and local regulations and standards.  This means all employees must be fully supportive of our Safety and Health Programs for it to be truly effective.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). \n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency action program is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nSafety requires the full diligence of each and every employee.  This safety awareness must exist in everyone's actions, thinking and planning.  Each employee must not only prevent obvious unsafe acts, but also must anticipate and eliminate potential hazards to him or her and co-workers.\n\nIt is NOCSA?s policy that all tasks and assignments will be performed in a safe and efficient manner, assuring the maximum opportunity for an accident-free workplace.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNew Orleans Cold Storage is a refrigerated warehouse for the storage of perishable foods.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) co"

Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAs RM program.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (3) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation and process freezing of perishable food products.  Through the use of single stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -25F. -35F and +11.5F.\n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system include the condenser, located on the roof, along with refrigerant vent lines where any leaks can dissipate to the air, joining ammonia produced by lightning where it can be consumed as it goes through a natural biodegrading process.  Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC.  Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from the High Pressure Receiver V-1 Vessel. A worst-case release from this vessel includes an estimated 30,000 pounds of ammonia.  For this Worst Case Release Scenario, the distance from source to toxic endpoint is 1.4 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these vessels;\nPressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these vessels and vessels have design margins of safety of about 4 to 1. Active mitigation would be the Emergency Shutdown System which permits system to equalize to 50-60 psig\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario is chosen as a pipe failure.  The potential for a pipe failure is possible given the extensive ammonia piping syst"
