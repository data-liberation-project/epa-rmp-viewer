      "SummaryText": "The City of Florence Wastewater Treatment Plant places high priority on safety and protection of the environment.  The accidental release policy involves safety mechanisms within the process, precautionary management practices, and conservative operating procedures.  Safety practices are based on guidelines act brought forth by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  Management of the facility is committed to onsite employee safety as well as the safety of the neighboring resident population.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant has coordinated emergency response procedures with the Florence Fire Department and endeavors to maintain compliance with EPA emergency response requirements.\n\nThe Florence Wastewater Treatment Plant treats the town?s wastewater before discharging to the Pee Dee River.  The Chlorination Process at the Wastewater Treatment Plant has been installed to supplement the UV disinfection process at the plant.  Chlorination of the wastewater stream will help ensure disinfection limits are met, such that the integrity of the downstream environment is preserved.  The chlorination system starts with the six [1] ton cylinders (two online and four on reserve) in the Chlorination Building.  The chlorine gas mixes with supply water in the chlorinator unit to form a chlorine solution.  This chlorine solution passes through underground piping from the Chlorination Building to the UV disinfection chamber where it is injected into the outgoing treated wastewater stream.  A visual and audible alarm is incorporated into the system to detect improper process conditions.  Operators make daily inspections of the chlorination process.  Safety equipment and repair kits are located on site.\n\nThe chlorination process is designed to help prevent releases.  Vacuum is used to transfer the chlorine gas through the majority of the piping from the cylinder to the chlorinators.  By using a vacuum process, piping leak releases are greatly reduced.  As a result of the previous inc"

      "SummaryText": "ident, an audible and visual alarm was installed to warn against detected leaks.  Shutoffs are in place and emergency repair kits and breathing apparatus are located onsite.  Training and awareness for chlorine have increased.  Operating procedures stress the dangers of chlorine gas and promote better process management.  A Process Safety Management Plan has been instituted in compliance with EPA and OSHA regulations. \nThe Florence Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had an accidental chlorine release in the past five years.  Alarms have been added to warn people in the immediate area of a detected leak.  Contractor awareness of chlorine hazards along with increased training has also been instituted.\n\nWithin the Process Safety Manual, emergency planning and response procedures are outlined.  There procedures include instructions for different scenarios.  Emergency response efforts will be coordinated with the Florence Fire Department.  Michael Hemmingway or Daniel Dietz should investigate the severity of a leak.  Training programs at the Florence Treatment Plant involve safe working practices, safety and health hazards and emergency operations.  Only specially trained and equipped personnel (plant personnel, fire department, and compressed gas supplier) should respond.  Strategic gas monitoring (downwind) will dictate response actions to be implemented.  Plant personnel will assist emergency personnel in the evacuation of any community residence anticipated of being affected by a release.  \n\nSince chlorination process at the Florence Wastewater Treatment Plant is a newly modified process, as of now, no changes in the process are expected.  Training is the major focus of the facility to improve safety."
