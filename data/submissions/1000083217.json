These teams are responsible for understanding regulatory requirements, identifying gaps in the program, and developing and implementing plans to close gaps and enhance the programs. The accident prevention practices are summarized in the following paragraphs.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Refinery has a written plan to encourage employee participation in its prevention program.  Employees give input into the program in many different ways; some of these include: Process Hazard Analysis participation, Members of Incident Investigation Teams, review and use of Operating Procedures, development of Unit Specific Training, Safe Practice Standard Committee Membership, Safety Awareness Committee, etc. In addition to the written employee participation plan, employee involvement is also achieved with several hourly/salaried employee committees that are responsible for safety and health evaluations at the refinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe foundation for safe plant operations is the knowledge of how it is designed and how it should operate.  This knowledge must provide for identifying and understanding the hazards of the chemicals and processes of the plant.  It is required that this knowledge be documented. Process Safety Information comprises three categories:\r\n     Hazards of materials\r\n     Technical information\r\n     Equipment design information\r\nThis information is made available to employees of the refinery and kept evergreen utilizing the facility Management of Change and Process Hazard Analysis process.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe Refinery conducts a Process Hazard Analysis on each operation within the plant. Typically, a HAZOP is the chosen method of analysis. These analyses identify and evaluate the process hazards, and analyze what protective measures are in place to control them.  From these analyses"

It also maintains a state of the art firewater system that can supply ample firewater for fire and toxic vapor release mitigation.  Since the last RMP update, the refinery has upgraded emergency response equipment including new rapid response trucks, a new ladder truck, and other firefighting apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is coordinated with the Will County Emergency Management Agency and the Will County LEPC.  The plan is also coordinated with the Lemont and Romeoville Fire Departments (local responders).  Periodically, response training and coordination is conducted to ensure the refinery response organization and local responders are familiar with each other's emergency response procedures and systems.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAt CITGO Lemont Refinery, we have a safety culture of continual improvement. A current focus is evaluation of process units for implementation of Emergency Remote Block Valves throughout the refinery. In addition, we have implemented a Key Performance Indicator monitoring and auditing processes so that we can identify concerns that could lead to unsafe conditions. By identifying lagging indicators, we are able to make corrections to our processes to prevent potential catastrophic events from occurring. We also participate in industry groups such as AFPM Occupational and Process Safety Regional Groups, API Operating Practice Symposiums, and HF Alkylation Symposiums to stay aware of industry issues and best practices."

Electronic incident management systems are in place to assure that recommendations are reviewed by management and implemented in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nThe Refinery performs an audit every three (3) years to ensure compliance with all elements of the OSHA PSM Standard and EPA Risk Management Program.  This audit is led by CITGO Corporate and performed by an outside entity (either personnel from other CITGO sites or 3rd Party Contractor). If non-compliance is discovered, then deficiencies in procedures and/or practices are reviewed and corrected.  \r\nIn addition to regulatory required audits, refinery management is constantly reviewing and evaluating PSM/RMP programs and Safety Practices to ensure that they are followed and in good standing.  Key Performance Indicators are developed and assessed on a regular basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information\r\nThe Refinery employs trained and certified Emergency Response and Medical Professionals that are at the facility 24 hours a day.  In addition, numerous shift operations personnel are trained to respond to and mitigate incidents.\r\n\r\nThe refinery maintains a Refinery Emergency Plan that ensures that incidents are properly planed for and dealt with.  This plan includes procedures for organization and administration of emergency response resources for events that may occur in the refinery.

The Refinery requires a PHA Revalidation take place every 5 years and will consist of either a Re-HAZOP or a PHA Checklist utilized to review the previous study including evaluating what hazards were identified, what changes have occurred, and any incidents that may have occurred on the process unit.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nOperating procedures that clearly and completely describe how to safely start-up, operate, temporary operate, and shut-down are maintained.  These procedures address the steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures undergo a review and approval process before being made effective.  All effective operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary and certified as current and accurate on an annual basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nOperators are trained in refinery and process overviews, refinery safe work practices, specific procedures required to operate their process unit. After a new operator has been hired, they will undergo a 6 week course of refinery overviews, safe work practices, and process introduction. Once this is complete, a new hire will be released to their process unit to continue with on-the-job training as well as classroom and computer based training (CBT).  This continues until that operator qualifies at each operator level. Refresher training is required every three (3) years and is provided vi"

Lemont Refinery has installed numerous mitigation systems to prevent effects of an HF release from occurring.  These include: \r\n     \u00bfRapid Acid De-Inventory System to quickly remove HF from the unit in the event of an emergency\r\n     \u00bfAuto-Activated Water Deluge Systems (Acid Settler, RADI Drums, and Acid pumps)\r\n     \u00bfAuto-Activated Water Curtain to surround the main acid area of the process unit in the event of an emergency\r\n     \u00bfHF and Hydrocarbon area detectors\r\n     \u00bfLaser HF Detection System\r\n     \u00bf10 Remotely controlled water cannons\r\n     \u00bfRemotely controlled equipment isolation \r\n     \u00bfHigh integrity (tandem) pump seals\r\n     \u00bfVideo surveillance - 10 cameras\r\n     \u00bfHF Sensing paint on pipe flanges and threaded connections to detect leaks of all sizes\r\n     \u00bfAcid Settler baffle to segregate HF acid in the vessel in order to reduce the amount of acid that could be released in the event of a breach.\r\n\r\nFor flammable releases, Lemont Refinery modeled a worst case flammable release from our single largest vessel containing a flammable mixture as well several other vessels that are located closer to the boundary of our property to verify that another vessel at the stationary source wouldn't potentially affect public receptors different from those potentially affected by the worst-case release scenario developed under requirements of the regulation. For our flammable alternate release scenario, we modeled a hole that develops in the feed line going into the Iso-Butane storage spheres.  This was chosen because of the area's close proximity to the property line and the usefulness this scenario provides for emergency planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n5 - Year Accident History\r\nWhile minor releases of regulated chemicals have occurred in the last 5 years, there has not been any releases from RMP covered processes that met the criteria established in 40 CFR 68.42. \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program"

      "SummaryText": "Lemont Refinery Risk Management Plan: Executive Summary\r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\r\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery believes that Safety, Environmental Stewardship, and being a good corporate neighbor are core business values.  To demonstrate these values substantial resources have been invested into the refinery in accident prevention.  It is our policy to include accident prevention in every part of our business, design, operations, and maintenance systems.  However, if a release should occur, substantial resources (trained response personnel and equipment) will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammable products and flammable mixtures, including propane and butane.  In addition, the refinery uses Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) as a catalyst to produce consumer hydrocarbon products.  In the past, Lemont Refinery used Anhydrous Ammonia and Chlorine but currently a 19% Aqueous Ammonia solution and Hypochlorite Bleach is being used in an effort to reduce the possible hazardous effects. At Lemont refinery, we have identified eleven (11) RMP Covered process units. \r\n\r\nOffsite Consequence Analysis (OCA)\r\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery utilized EPA's RMP*Comp as the release modeling software to perform its offsite consequence analysis.  Each of these analyses is utilized to complete the OCA section of the RMP Submission.\r\n\r\nFor toxic modeling, the only toxic chemical above threshold quantity is HF therefore worst case modeling used the greatest amount held in a single vessel being released over a 10 minute period.  Alternate release scenario modeling was done on a hose failure that occurs during the HF unloading process.  In the unlikely event of a release, water is the best m"
