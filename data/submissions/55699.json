As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112? Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Al-Corn Clean Fuel completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nAl-Corn Clean Fuel is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane, isopentane and butane as constituents of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant as well as anhydrous ammonia. The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the product unfit for human consumption. The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  It is the policy of Al-Corn Clean Fuel to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, it is the policy of Al-Corn Clean Fuel to notify the City of Claremont Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility.\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain pentane, isopentane and butane, RMP-regulated substances. The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 390,000 pounds. The natural gasoline may contain pentane up to 45 percent by volume (140,000 lbs), isopentane up to 35 percent by volume (110,000 lbs) and butane up to 4 percent by volume (12,000 lbs). The natural gasoline is stored in two tanks as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production. These tanks are located in th"

      "SummaryText": "e facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 100,000 pounds.  Al-Corn Clean Fuel has evaluated the worst-cast and alternative case scenarios as it relates to each of these reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented.  Al-Corn Clean Fuel has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThrough completion of this RMP, Al-Corn Clean Fuel has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site. Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis. Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nOn 12/1/2004 an employee was injured by anhydrous ammonia.  The employee was performing maintenance on the ammonia pump when a valve in the area was bumped and opened.  Anhydrous ammonia sprayed in the employees face.  The employee was hospitalized for one night and returned to work the following week.  Additional details regarding the accident are contained in Section 6.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nAl-Corn Clean Fuel is committed to continuous improvement of safety at the facility.  At this time, Al-Corn Clean Fuel is in the process of updating and revising PSM program elements based upon the 9/10/2007 internal compliance audit."
