GRACE & CO., LAKE CHARLES, LA\n\nEPA FACILITY ID# 1000 0003 1324\n17903 LDEQ FACILITY ID NUMBER\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe W. R. Grace, Lake Charles facility has a long standing commitment to community and worker safety.  This commitment is evidenced by the time and resources spent on training, safe design, operation and maintenance of all plant processes.  The objective of this commitment is to prevent any release from ever happening.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe W. R. Grace, Lake Charles facility is an inorganic chemical plant that manufactures synthetic fluid cracking and hydrotreating catalyst products.  These product lines have evolved since the plant was built in 1953 to meet the needs of crude oil refining.  The facility processes only one chemical (aqua ammonia-conc. 20% or greater) in quantities high enough to be regulated by the 112(r) rule.  This chemical is used in the plant to wash catalysts and control NOx emissions.  The maximum amount of aqua ammonia that can be stored on the plant site is 580,000 pounds.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nOver the past 5 years there have been no releases of aqua ammonia that have caused enough adverse consequences to meet the criteria for historical reporting.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nBecause the aqua ammonia process at the facility is regulated by the EPA RMP rule as a Program 3 process, the process is also subject to OSHA PSM.  Thus, under both EPA and OSHA, the aqua ammonia process is subject to an accident prevention program.  The following is a summary of the Program 3 elements contained in the general accident prevention program in place at the Lake Charles facility.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:\n\nThe W. R. Grace facility encourages employees to participate in all of the programs in the prevention program.  Employee participation is evident in accident investigation, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), training"

The VPP certification effort now in progress involves many employees that serve on key committees.  This open participation for employees is documented in the facility accident prevention, or Process Safety Management (PSM), program.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION:\n\nThe W. R. Grace facility creates and maintains documents related to maintaining a safe operation of the aqua ammonia process.  These documents contain information that addresses chemical properties, chemical hazards, limits for key process parameters, tank inventories, equipment design basis, materials of construction, design pressure, and temerpature rating.  Other information on aqua ammonia, including exposure hazards and emergency response guidelines, is found on the Material Safety Data Sheets.  This information on aqua ammonia is maintained current to provide a basis for establishing inspections and maintenance activities, as well as being utilized during PHAs.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA):\n\nThe W. R. Grace facility has a comprehensive program for reviewing the aqua ammonia process.  The program is a systematic examination of the process, which will identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nA team of individuals representing safety, environmental, operations, maintenance, and engineering are assembled to conduct the analysis.  The team utilizes the \"What If\" and \"HAZOP\" techniques to evaluate the hazards and risks, and makes recommendations concerning specific findings.  The findings from PHAs are assigned to team members for final resulution.  The final resulution of each finding is documented and retained.  A PHA is done on the ammonia system every 5 years, or whenever the system is significantly altered or changed.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:\n\nThe W. R. Grace facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of operation of the aqua ammon"

These modes include normal startup; normal operation; temporary operation; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; and initial startup of the process with new or modified equipment.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate.\n\nTRAINING:\n\nAll employees operating and maintaining the aqua ammonia process are trained on a regular basis about the operating proedures and other aspects of the process.  New operators are classroom trained and then work with experienced operators to receive on-the-job training.  After new operators have demonstrated the necessary skills to safely operate the process they are allowed to operate independently.\n\nCONTRACTORS:\n\nThe W. R. Grace facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors receive training.  This training is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview; information about safety and health hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the facility evaluates contactor safety programs and performance during the slection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensue that contractors are following the necessary procedures.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS:\n\nAny time there is a significant change to the aqua ammonia process itself, or the process safety information associated with the aqua ammonia process, a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) is conducted.  This review will assure that the process and its personnel are prepared to start up.  Items reviewed include confirmation that construction is in accordance with design; operating procedures are developed; PHAs completed; management of change followed; and training conducted.

Grace facility has practices and procedures to maintain the integrity of the aqua ammonia process equipment to minimize the potential for an ammonia release to the environment.  The basic program includes maintenance training; written maintenance procedures; periodic inspections and tests of equipment; and correction of deficiencies found.  Equipment found to be deficient must be repaired before placing the equipment back in service.\n\nTo achieve quality assurance in equipment maintenance for the aqua ammonia process a quality assurance program is incorporated into the purchase, repair, and warehousing of spare parts.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES--HOT WORK PERMIT:\n\nW. R. Grace has incorporated many safe work practices in the daily execution of business.  Examples include the lockout/tagout procedures, the confined space entry procedures, and the hot work permit procedures.  The hot work permit is used to control welding, cutting, brazing, and burning work in the aqua ammonia process area.  The hot work permit assures that a supervisor has checked the aqua ammonia process area for combustibles prior to hot work.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:\n\nThe W. R. Grace facility has a management of change (MOC) procedure that applies to all processes, including the aqua ammonia process.  The MOC procedure manages chemical, equipment, and procedural changes to the process to assure that any proposed change will not result in an undetected, unsafe condition.  The proper level of authority assures the change is safe and that a review of the changes's effect on health, safety, and the environment is completed.  Training of all affected presonnel is accomplished prior to the change occurring.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION:\n\nThe W. R.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contarctors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are ratained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS:\n\nCompliance audits are performed on the aqua ammonia process risk management plan to determine how well the policies and procedures satisfy the requirements of the Risk Management Plan rule.  The audits are conducted at least every three years.  The audit findings are documented and forwarded to management for reivew.  All corrective actions required are tracked until completion.  Documentation of the audit procedures and the last two audits are maintained as part of the compliance audit program.  An agency audit of the RMP/PSM management plan was conducted in 2001, with no findings or violations noted.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the W. R. Grace facility have many hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program summarized previously is applied to the aqua ammonia process.  This prevention program helps prevent potential ammonia releases, which could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\n\nIn addition to the prevention program, the W. R.
