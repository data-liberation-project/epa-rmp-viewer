      "SummaryText": "The Des Moines Metropolitan Wastewater Reclamation Authority (WRA) treats the wastewater of Polk County and surrounding areas.  Our treatment process produces digester gas (methane) and uses gaseous chlorine to disinfect the wastewater before discharge to the Des Moines River.  A result of our production and use is the storage of chlorine and digester gas (methane) in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP/PSM is required.\n\n\n\nGaseous chlorine contained in 1-ton cylinders is found in our disinfection building.  A total of 20 cylinders will be on site at a given time with a maximum of 10 in use.  \n\n\n\nDigester gas is a byproduct of the biosolids stabilization process and consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide.  This methane is stored and used as a power source in the plant facility, sold, metered and piped to a neighboring industrial complex for energy production and when gas is produced in excess of use and storage capabilities, flared.  The largest methane storage vessel located at the WRA our pressurized storage sphere, which can contain up to 15,712 lbs of methane at a maximum pressure of 45 psig.  \n\n\n\nThe Des Moines WRA has instituted a prevention program designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.  The prevention program consists of twelve elements, a few of which are highlighted below.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) are conducted by a highly experienced and knowledgeable team that evaluates potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions and external factors that might affect the processes are the focus of the PHAs.  The information gathered and recommendations of the PHA team are used by WRA staff to improve safety of our process and to prevent unintended releases.  \n\n\n\nOperating procedures for the chlorine and digester gas systems have been developed and updated to assure continuous, efficient and safe operation of the facility."

      "SummaryText": "  The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process.  Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.  \n\n\n\nThe WRA maintains an in-house HAZWOPR team that have been trained to respond to, at a minimum, the alternative scenario release of our hazardous substances.  Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorination or digester gas processes must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process.  Training must empha safety and health hazards and safe work practices.  Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years whereas refresher training for emergency response is conducted annually.  \n\n\n\nThe WRA screens potential contractors to ensure that ones are selected who can perform work on or adjacent to the chlorine and digester gas processes without compromising the safety and health of employees at the facility.  \n\n\n\nTo ensure that hot work including, but not limited to, welding, cutting and brazing is performed safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed which requires a permit be issued before hot work can begin.  \n\n\n\nA new or significantly modified process will not be initiated  without first performing a Pre-Startup Safety Review.  The purpose of a Pre-Startup Safety Review is to ensure that the facility is ready to begin operating potentially hazardous processes.  \n\n\n\nThe mechanical integrity program addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules and personnel training.  The intent of this program is to ensure that equipment used to process, store or handle chlorine and digester gas is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.  \n\n\n\nThe Des Moines WRA adheres to a Management of Change system.  Under this system, all modifications to the chlorine or digester gas systems are reviewed by maintenance,"

      "SummaryText": " operations, engineering and safety teams before they are implemented to determine if the modification will compromise system safety. The intent is to require that any modifications made to equipment, procedures, or process conditions (other than replacement-in-kind) be managed by identifying and reviewing before implementation.  \n\n\n\nLastly, each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a release of chlorine or digester gas is investigated.  The WRA has developed a process to identify the underlying causes of an incident and implement procedures in order to prevent similar events from occurring in the future.  As of the time of this summary, no incidents or releases had occurred in the previous five years.  \n\n\n\nThe Des Moines WRA has set up an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) which provides specific emergency response procedures for accidental releases of chlorine or digester gas.  The ERP procedures cover a release from the initial alarm stage through either leak stoppage or local emergency Hazmat response team assistance.  As part of the emergency response procedures, there are plans for victim rescue, leak investigation and communication with additional support agencies.  In addition, critical plant operations are identified to ensure that, if possible, the critical WRA functions are kept operational.  The ERP also addresses plant site communication, emergency response equipment, first aid and medical treatment, medical surveillance and consultation, and emergency response drills."
