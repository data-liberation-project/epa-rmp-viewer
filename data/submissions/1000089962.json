This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  BCE-Mach III Midstream Holdings LLC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to the Lincoln Gas Plants for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas.\r\n\r\n.\r\nCryo I: Compression contains a 40 MMSCFD plant inlet gas capacity, 20 MMSCFD gas capacity located in the field, and 56 MMSCFD plant residue gas capacity (100% plant inlet capacity after process shrink). \r\n\r\nCryo II: Cryogenic Gas Processing Plant, nameplate capacity of 200 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD).\r\n\r\nThe plant consists of inlet gas compression, separation and filtration, a condensate stabilizer, amine treatment, cryogenic processing, residue compression, and, including all associated utilities and ancillary systems. Crude oil received and stored from the field is stored in a 50,000-barrel tank and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment. The lack units can receive or deliver crude oil. NGL from the cryogenic units and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nBCE-Mach III Midstream Holdings LLC has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nBCE-Mach III Midstream Holdings LLC  primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution per BCE-Mach III Midstream Holdings LLC's Risk Management Protocol.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nLincoln Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown,\r\n(5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Lincoln Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedance for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Lincoln Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program f"

After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nThe Lincoln Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, BCE-Mach III Midstream Holdings LLC has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance.
