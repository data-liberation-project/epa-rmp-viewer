This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Energy Transfer release mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if an unintentional release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to respond by activating the plant's Emergency Shutdown (ESD) System in an effort to safely avert further unintentional product release, evacuate the release area and to notify local emergency response authorities.\n\t\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ROGER MILLS GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 10 miles northwest of Elk City in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, operates a propane refrigeration system to assist in extracting liquid petroleum products from rich raw natural gas.  The refrigeration system includes a High Pressure Receiver vessel containing propane, a regulated flammable material.\n\t\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity present at the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant.  It is noteworthy that the Roger Mills Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\t\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance"

      "SummaryText": "in this program Level 1 gas plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of 19,400 lbs within the propane HP Receiver. The inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.2 miles. Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating or calculating the WCS for the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant.  \n\t\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Roger Mills Gas Plant.  Because the processes at the gas plant which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. \n\t\n\t\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\t\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\t\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all processes at the Roger Mills Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\t\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\t\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant has safety features on many systems to help: (1) contain/control an unintentional release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of an unintentional release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\t\nRelease Detection\n\u00bf\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms and shutdowns\n\u00bf\tHigh/Low alarms and shutdowns\n\u00bf\tPlant is on a 24-hour Gas Control callout system\n\t\nRelease Containment/Control\n\u00bf\tProcess relief valves tha"

There have been no accidental releases that have occurred that have resulted in offsite effects over the past year.  We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\n\t\n\t\t\t  \t\n\t\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\t\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for safely responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency action response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a flammable release occurs. Company personnel are also available to assess post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency action response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency action response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties."

      "SummaryText": "The emergency action program is updated when necessary and is based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Energy Transfer gas plant facilities.\n\t\nThe overall emergency action program for the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Roger Mills County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\t\n\nRMP CERTIFICATION STATEMENT\n\"Based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following process(es) is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor: HP RECEIVER. Within the past five years, the process(es) has (have) had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process(es), entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nJames Tabor\nSr. PSM/RMP Specialist \nEnergy Transfer 1-23-2024"
