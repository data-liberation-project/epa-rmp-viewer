The safety systems and process controls at Yorba Linda Water District's Richfield site, enclosure, scrubber, detectors, alarms, etc., will not allow a release to occur that will travel offsite.  The EPA requires that the alternative release scenario travel offsite, thus the only mitigation measure used is isolation of the release after 10-minutes.\n\nOne worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario are presented in this RMP.  Distances for the worst-case and alternative release scenario have been determined using the look-up tables in the EPA Guidance Document for WasteWater Treatment Facilities.\n\nThe worst-case release is a release of the entire contents of a one-ton cylinder (2,000 lbs.) over a ten-minute period.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.3 miles.  This release scenario does have an offsite impact.  The public and some of the regulation's public receptor types are impacted.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nThe more realistic alternative release scenario is a release of chlorine vapor from 5/16-inch hole from failure of a vapor valve.  For this scenario, 150 lbs. of chlorine are released over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles.  This release scenario does impact the public and industrial neighbors.  No environmental receptors are impacted.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program - Specific Steps \n\nYorba Linda Water District has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  The program addresses the chlorination process that is covered by the EPA's RMP rule, the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, and OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\n\nThe accidental release program involves process design that minimizes the quantities chlorine onsite and equipment design and construction to meet all applicable codes and standards.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nYorba Linda Water District's Commitment to Safety, Accident Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nYorba Linda Water District is committed to operating a safe, clean and efficient chlorination system.  The resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation and operation of our chlorination system demonstrate this commitment.  \n\nFacility Description and Substances Handled\n\nYorba Linda Water District's Richfield site is located at 913 Richfield Road in Placentia, California.  Yorba Linda Water District uses chlorine for well water disinfecting prior to water distribution.  The maximum amount of chlorine onsite is two (2) one-ton containers, or 4,000 lbs.  These one-ton containers are housed in a cinderblock room equipped with chlorine detectors that activate a scrubber system and initiate a series of emergency phone calls via an auto-dial system.  \n\nThe one-ton containers are secured to scales and equipped with a vacuum regulator that is used to control the flow of chlorine to the water line.  From the vacuum regulator, the gaseous chlorine flows through flexible hosing, through a chlorinator, rotometer, to an injection unit where it is mixed into a water line.  \n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe main hazard at the Yorba Linda Water District Richfield site is a release of chlorine.  A worst-case  scenario is defined as the catastrophic release of the largest single inventory of the regulated substance.  For toxic substances, such as chlorine, the release is over a 10-minute period.  Alternative release scenarios present more realistic process hazards such as failure of piping or valves.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios assume that none of the many safety systems and process controls are operational.  For alternative release scenarios, the RMP regulation allows credit for passive and active mitigation systems.  However, the alternative release scenario presented in this RMP d"

      "SummaryText": "e are a number of safety systems, such as process controls, warning alarms, and operational controls in place to prevent a release from occurring.\n\nYorba Linda Water District has written safety information on the chlorination process, equipment and procedures available to all employees who work in the chlorination area.  This includes information on the hazards of chlorine, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of the accidental release prevention program is monitored by Process Hazards Analyses (PHA) which has been performed for the chlorination system.  PHAs provide a method for understanding potential hazardous events, the means by which they occur and what actions are likely to prevent them from occurring.  A team approach is used on the PHAs to evaluate the potential consequences of failures in the chlorination system.  The safeguards in place for each hazard are recorded and evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Recommendations are then made to improve safety where the existing safeguards were not considered adequate by the PHA team.  A PHA of the chlorine system was completed in 1998 and will be updated on a 5-year cycle.\n\nThe basis for proper and safe operation of the chlorination system is provided by written operating procedures.  These procedures define the operating limits, identify safety and health consideration, and detail the operation and function of safety systems.  Specific modes of operation covered are startup, normal operations, emergency and normal shutdown, and temporary operations.\n\nTo complement the written operating procedures, Yorba Linda Water District Employees receive training in: specific safety and health hazards, operation of the chlorination system, emergency operations and all applicable safe work practices for the system.\n\nYorba Linda Water District has a mechanical integrity program to ensure that all equipment in the chlorination system is regularly inspected and maintained."

The management of change (MOC) procedures ensures that any changes that are not like-in-kind are documented and analyzed to ensure that the change is safe.  The MOC procedure ensures that all changes are documented properly authorized, and that all employees whose job tasks will be affected by the change are informed and receive appropriate training prior to the change.  \n\nA pre-startup safety review will be conducted for any new covered process or significant modification to the chlorination system.  The purpose of these reviews is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared prior to operation.\n\nThe performance of these safety programs and procedures is monitored through audits, periodic drills, and inspections.\n\nYorba Linda Water District will investigate any incident that results in, or could result in, a release of chlorine.  These investigations will follow a written procedure and be performed by a team from Yorba Linda Water District.  The goal of incident investigation is to determine the root cause of the accident and to develop corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence of the incident.  All corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team recommendations will be tracked until complete.\n\nThe employee participation plan details employee involvement in safety and the prevention program.\n\nYorba Linda Water District has a contractor safety program to ensure that contractors who work in or adjacent to the chlorination system are properly trained and meet safety criteria defined by Yorba Linda Water District.  \n\nChlorine Specific Prevention Steps"

Chlorine is stored in one-ton containers.  These containers are regularly inspected and comply with DOT regulations.  Each container has fusible plugs that melt to prevent container rupture if exposed to fire or other sources of high temperature.  The system is designed with a minimum number of connections to minimize leak potential.  Containers, valves, and fittings are specifically designed for chlorine service.  The chlorination system is designed to operate under vacuum so system leaks will not result in a release of chlorine vapor.  Additionally, the chlorine system is housed in a cinderblock room equipped with chlorine detectors that activate a scrubber system and initiate a series of emergency phone calls via an auto-dial system.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nAs a result of Yorba Linda Water District's commitment to safety, there have been no accidents as defined in the RMP rule in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nTo be prepared for potential chlorine releases, Yorba Linda Water District communicates with the Orange County Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Department who is contacted by the emergency auto-dial system in the event of a chlorine release.  Yorba Linda Water District has an Emergency Response Plan and employees who work in the chlorination area have received HAZWOPER training.\n\nSafety Improvements\n\nTo achieve Yorba Linda Water District's excellent safety track record, safety improvements have been made over the last decade.  These include:\n\n- Reduction in the quantity of chlorine stored at Yorba Linda Water District sites\n- Upgrade of the chlorination system\n- Cinderblock enclosure with chlorine detectors and scrubber system\n- Emergency auto-dial system initiated by chlorine release\n\nAdditionally, the chlorination system was designed to meet specific seismic requirements in Southern Califo"
