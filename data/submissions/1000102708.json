A primary aspect of this commitment is the City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant to help ensure the safe operation of the water chlorination process.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, the City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant has procedures that are designed to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies.  Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant established a management system to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program.\n\n\n2.0  City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant handles one substance regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) rule in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. \n\nProcess Description: Chlorination\nProgram Level: 3\nRegulated Substance: Chlorine\n\n\n3.0  Hazard"

      "SummaryText": "Assessment Results\n\nThe City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of accidental releases of the Chlorine from our process. The regulated substance was evaluated for a possible worse-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.  It is important to understand that the City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenario represents a more realistic potential for occurrence and is based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant has developed an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence.  This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public and/or the environment as a result of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances farther than the endpoint, the effects would be less.\n\n3.1  Hazard Assessment - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with Regulated Toxic Substances is a failure of a full, one ton (2000 lb) cylinder of liquid chlorine.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine releases is a release from a vessel leak.  The modeled release lasted for 30 minutes before it is stopped.  A toxic cloud formed by the evaporating chlorine would reach offsite endpoints and public receptors.\n\n\n4.0  Accidental Release Prevention Program - Program 3\n\nThe City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant Chlorination Process is covered b"

The Chlorination Process Prevention Program consists of the following elements.\n\n4.1  Process Safety Information\n\nThe City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  These documents address:\n\n* physical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n* chemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n* operating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n* design basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n* specific chemical inventories.\n \nThe City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant ensures that the process safety information is available to all City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant employees, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the local fire department.  \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine and other chemicals used in our process.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\n\nThe City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, the Chlorination Process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo perform the PHAs, City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant primarily uses the \"What-if/Checklist\" technique.  The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the City of Worcester Water Filtration Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.
