Facility Policy\n\n              The owners, management, and employees of Country Spring Farmers Co-op are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Green Springs Fire department or other local and federal authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information.\n\n             The primary activity in the spring at the Green Springs branch is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n             Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n             The maximum quantity stored would be 98,880 pounds in our two-12,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handle would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release.\n\n             a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 49,440 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .78 mile.\n\n              b. The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .48 miles.                                                                                                          \n\n4.

There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
