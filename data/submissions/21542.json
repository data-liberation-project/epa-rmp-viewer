      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Pioneer Frozen Foods are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Such releases are not forseeable but our plans are fully coordinated with the highly trained emergency response personnel at Duncanville Emergency Operations Center to control and mitigate the effects of any releases.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale storage, processing and manufacture of frozen dough products.  Anhydrous ammonia is the major regulated substance present at our facility. All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\nThe maximum inventory of ammonia at our facility is 17,000.00 lb.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from an ammonia refrigeration system.  The scenario involves the release of 17,000 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.63 miles is obtained c"

The scenario involves the release of 1,700 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 15 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia is 0.085 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information.\nPioneer Frozen Foods maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the \"What if\" methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of one year.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nPioneer Frozen Foods has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once a year and more frequently if needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPioneer Frozen Foods carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are carried out by qualified personnel with a strong background in maintenance practices.  Specialized training is provided to these personnel as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Pioneer Frozen Foods to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel and all other employees whose job tasks are affected by a change in a process are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the changes.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Pioneer Frozen Foods.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are s"

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nPioneer Frozen Foods promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPioneer Frozen Foods truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information collected as part of the facility's compliance with the RMP Rule including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Pioneer Frozen Foods has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n5.

The incident was a result of human error.  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident.  There was some damage to property offsite.  There were no onsite impacts.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nPioneer Frozen Foods has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
