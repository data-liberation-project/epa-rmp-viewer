This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility takes propane and an occasional propane/butane interface off the Eastern Delivery System pipeline operated by Dome Pipeline Corporation, and stores the propane and propane/butane interface in various aboveground bullets, the largest being 103,000 gallons. Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the facility and is injected into the propane stream prior to truck and rail loading.   The propane/butane interface is trucked back to the Sarnia Fractionation plant  in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada on an as needed basis.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified "
