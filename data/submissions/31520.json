      "SummaryText": "The owners, management, and employees of Winneshiek Cooperative Association (WCA) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, WCA is prepared to work with the fire department, the Winneshiek County Emergency Management services, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, law enforcement, and any and all other local, state, and federal agencies.  WCA will work with these agencies to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and to the environment.  While always having been committed to safety, management has increased its commitment in recent months.  The General Manager is now also the Safety Director.  Compliance policies are being reviewed and in some cases they are being rewritten in a clearer language more specific to each facility and process.\n    The primary activity at the Burr Oak facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The facility also includes a dry fertilizer plant, liquid fertilizer tanks, and a bagged feed, seed and crop protection product warehouse.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 30,000 gallon bulk tank.  The tank, with a maximum capacity of 154,500 pounds, is mounted on two cement pillars.  The tank is not filled above an 85% capacity which reduces the storage to 131,325 pounds.  There are also nurse tanks and sidedress applicators belonging to this location which may contain anhydrous.  If all tanks and applicators are on site and filled to 85%, that would increase the on site inventory by over 194,000 pounds.\n    The Burr Oak facility is inspected by the Iowa Department of Agriculture each year.  Recommendations made by the inspector are used as a means to improve safety conditions for employees and the community.  Anhydrous ammonia equipment is inspected on a daily basis during the spring plantin"

      "SummaryText": "g and fall harvest seasons.  Much of the non-durable equipment (including hoses, safety valves) are replaced on a regular basis most of the time long before required to be replaced by other state and federal standards.  The number of staff who are allowed to handle the anhydrous ammonia is limited to competent personnel.  \n    This facility follows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.  Attention is also paid to Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, and published by the American National Standards Institute.\n   On April 12, 2004, there occurred an on site release of anhydrous ammonia.  The release was a result of not following correct procedures.  The result was that a Winneshiek Coop employee was injured.  Personnel responded correctly with first aid procedures.  No evacuations were necessary as the release lasted only a few seconds and was from an applicator. \n   The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major release.  If any release takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at this and all of our facilities.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility and company policies and procedures.  They are performed at a minimum of once each year.  This facility has had the local fired department walk thru the facility in April of 2004.  The facility is included in the current local emergency response plan compiled by the Winneshiek County Local Emergency Management Director.  He was last contacted on May 21, 2004 to verify that all information was accurate."
