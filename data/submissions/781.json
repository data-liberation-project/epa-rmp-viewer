The properties of sulfur dioxide makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of sulfur dioxide to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle sulfur dioxide combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personal.\n\nColorado Sweet Gold's emergency response program includes the response plan procedures for notification of the local fire Hazardous Materials authority, Colorado Sweet Gold's Hazardous Materials Contractor and notification of any potentially affected neighbors by means of local law enforcement and local fire department.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary function of this facility is corn wet milling. Sulfur dioxide is injected in to the steeping water to aid in the steeping process. Sulfur dioxide is received by truck transport and stored in a pressured tank. The storage tank is located on the second floor of the mill building in an enclosed room. The sulfur dioxide system falls under OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and complies with the Process Safety Management Program requirements. The process is manned 24 hours a day 365 days a year.\n\nThe maximum amount of sulfur dioxide that can be stored at this plant is 66,000 pounds.\n\n\n3.

The amount of sulfur dioxide that would be released in the storage room would be 66,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint of 1psi for the worst-case scenario is 20 miles. \n\nAlternative Scenario:  Unloading hose failure 30-foot length of 4-inch hose. The excess flow valve function to stop flow. The contents of the unloading line are released. The distance to the endpoint for the lower toxic limit for the alternative scenario is 0.31 miles. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis corn wet milling facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, OSHA's Process Safety Management Program and with all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The sulfur dioxide system was designed and constructed in accordance with ASME pressure vessel code. All of our employees have been thoroughly trained in the safe handling and spill procedures for sulfur dioxide. Employees involved in unloading have been trained in proper unloading procedures and the use of personal protective equipment.\n\n\n5.Five-year accident history:\n\nTwo the best of our knowledge there have been no accidental releases of sulfur dioxide in the last five years. Colorado Sweet Gold LLC purchased the facility in March 1999.\n\n\n6. The emergency response program:\n\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA regulation 1910.120. The Johnstown Fire Department has reviewed and approved our facility emergency response program. The facility's emergency response plan is included in the Weld County plan.\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nInstall a vaporizer in the sulfur dioxide system."
