If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Hoechst Celanese Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a chemical packaging plant.  We use propane for propellant in aerosol cans.  The system consists of 12,000-gallon propane tank and associated piping, valves, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 12,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nChemWay Systems, Inc. has not had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Hoechst Celanese Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department, and members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\n\nChemWay does not have any planned changes to improve safety."
