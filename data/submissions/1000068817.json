This Executive Summary is also submitted in the e-Submit to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).\n\n40 CFR Part 68.155\n\nThe Athens Utilities, Water Services Department, Athens Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has adopted this Risk Management Program under 40 CFR 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention regulations regulating extremely hazardous substances (EHS). This Risk Management Program as documented in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) will assist in preventing the occurrence and minimizing the consequences of chemical releases.\n\nThis Executive Summary includes information required under 40 CFR Part 68.155.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAthens Utilities implements preventive maintenance, inspection, and testing programs to minimize the potential for accidental releases. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been reviewed and revised to enable employees to perform their work safely.\n\nAthens WTP personnel will respond only to incidental releases that occur during routine maintenance and will call the Fire Department in the event of an accidental chemical release. Emergency response to accidental releases is conducted by the City of Athens Police and Fire Department and State and County Emergency Management Agencies.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Athens WTP utilizes chlorine (a regulated EHS) as a disinfectant in the drinking water treatment process.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA Hazard Review has been conducted to enable personnel to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving an EHS. Athens WTP personnel have verified that equipment used in the chlorine process complies with applicable codes and standards and with industry accepted good engineering practices. The Hazard Review documents the process and find"

It is the policy of Athens Utilities that employees involved in working with and around the chlorine system are trained in process and safety procedures. The mechanical integrity of chlorine process equipment is documented and maintained through maintenance, inspection, and testing programs.\n\nA Compliance Audit Program has also been conducted. The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a successful Risk Management Program is maintained, implemented, and followed by personnel.\n\nPersonnel have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine in the workplace will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP. The Athens WTP chlorine system process and technology are not considered confidential business information or trade secrets and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last 5 years, the Athens WTP has had no (zero) accidental releases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe RMP Emergency Response Program for the WTP includes the following elements:\n\n? Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\n\n? Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures\n\n? Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance\n\n? Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance\n\n? Training"

Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the stationary source and ensure that employees are informed of changes\n\nWTP personnel will take action in the event of an incidental release during routine maintenance and will not attempt to control any other type of release. Personnel would immediately notify the Fire Department for assistance in the event of a non-incidental release. The Athens WTP Superintendent coordinates response efforts with the Limestone County Emergency Management Agency, Athens Fire Department's Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Team, Owens Volunteer Fire Department, the Athens Police Department, and the local hospital. Note: 9-1-1 is routed to the area volunteer fire departments, who will call the Athens Fire Department directly. The Athens Fire Department maintains a HAZMAT Team.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe WTP planned changes to improve safety include: placing 2 windsocks onsite."
