The objective of this self-evaluation program is to ensure that a successful Risk Management Program is maintained, implemented, and followed by personnel.\r\nPersonnel have developed a formal documented system to manage incident investigations and follow up. Each incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of chlorine in the workplace will be investigated and an incident investigation report filed in the RMP. The Athens WTP chlorine system process and technology are not considered confidential business information or trade secrets and any information regarding the process or process chemistry is available for review in the RMP.\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nIn the last 5 years, the Athens WTP has had no (zero) accidental releases.\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe RMP Emergency Response Program for the WTP includes the following elements:\r\n\u00bf Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases\r\n\u00bf Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures\r\n\u00bf Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance\r\n\u00bf Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance\r\n\u00bf Training"
