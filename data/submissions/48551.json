Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even replacement in kind) be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\n\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\n\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria.  This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all the other 12 areas of PSM program are followed, the company requires compliance audits.

Low temperature system (-27\u00b0F @ 0.4 PSIG).\n2. Medium temperature system (+19\u00b0F @ 32.5 PSIG).\n3. Thermosyphon pilot receiver system (95\u00b0F @ 181.1 PSIG).\n4. Condenser system (95\u00b0F C.T. 80\u00b0F W.B.).\n5. Compressor low-temperature system (-29\u00b0F @ 0.8  hg.).\n6. Compressor medium-temperature system (+17\u00b0F @ 30.4 PSIG).\n\nMajor equipment located inside the engine room includes:\n\u00b7 Two low-temperature compressors ( both are FES model 400-GLE Compressor packages, each rated @ 150.1 TR/ 449.2 BHP ).\n\u00b7 One medium-temperature compressor ( FES model 290-GLE Compressor package, rated @ 314.8 TR/ 360.6 BHP). \n\u00b7 One 36 dia.

The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThis hazard assessment was conducted to meet the RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis requirements for the ammonia refrigeration system.

The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the low temperature recirculator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling this vessel causing the released quantity to be equal to the total vessel volume with no piping volume included.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated in this hazard assessment include two possible scenarios. First alternate scenario (OCA-2) is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (57.6 lbs/min) with a release duration of sixty (60) minutes.\n\nThe second alternative scenario (OCA-3) is the direct release of liquid from a \u00bd   diameter hole/valve in a vessel having an internal pressure of 181.1 psig.  The size of this release is based on a ten (10) minute release duration at a release rate calculated from the simplified Bernoulli equation found on page 4-14 in Chapter 4 of the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration. \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for hte RMP. Following is an overview.\n\nParticipation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole.
