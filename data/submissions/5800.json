The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss their concerns.  The group meets periodically and covers topics of interest to the members including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, health issues and process safety performance.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nOver the past five years the Niagara Falls Plant has received the following OxyChem safety and environmental awards:\n\n7 OxyChem Corporate Environmental Merit Award - 1996 through 1998\nFor full permit compliance\n\n7 OxyChem Corporate Environmental Pollution Prevention Award - 1998\n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Niagara Falls Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety and environmental program. In fact, the Niagara Falls Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.

The off-site consequence analysis evaluates a worst-case release scenario  and an alternative case release scenario .  The Plant does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative case release scenario was selected to help the LEPC organize the community emergency response plan. \n\nTrinity software modeling was used for evaluating the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case and alternative case scenarios.  The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst-case scenario and EPA-suggested values for the alternative case scenario. The EPA-recommended Landview III Program, available from the U.S. Census, was utilized to estimate the number of people living within worst-case and alternative case distances from the location of the storage tank and the public and environmental receptors located within these distances.\n\nIn both release scenarios, the heated formaldehyde solution rapidly cools upon release and contact with the concrete or asphalt ground surface.

A concrete diked area contains the released formaldehyde solution while an estimated 50 lb. of formaldehyde gas vaporizes.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration based on modeling is 0.16 miles from the source.  The U.S. Census indicates that 50 people live within this distance from the location of the tank.  The only public receptor located within this distance is an industrial area.  The only environmental receptor located within this distance is a small, isolated wetland.\n\nThe alternative case release scenario for a 45% solution of formaldehyde is a failed gasket or weld at the pressurized Formalin Loop and the leaking of 7,500 lb. of formaldehyde solution (64 lb. of formaldehyde vapor) to the asphalt/concrete surface below over a 30 minute period.  The maximum amount spilled is based on data from a previous Formalin Loop leak at a similar facility.  Modeling this scenario indicates a toxic endpoint distance of 0.04 miles from the source.  The U.S. Census indicates that 2 people live within this distance.  The only public receptor located within this distance is an industrial area.  The only environmental receptor located within this distance is a small, isolated wetland.\n\n3.2.\tProgram 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.

The Niagara Falls Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyChem limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Niagara Falls Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Niagara Falls Plant, OxyChem considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyChem strives to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  OxyChem implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Niagara Falls Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated, and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment.  OxyChem also uses the corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Engineering Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.

The facility is located at 5000 Packard Road.  The facility was originally constructed in 1928.  Overall, the facility employs 95 full-time employees.\n\n1.\tThe Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (68.155(a))\nOxyChem is committed to operating the Niagara Falls, New York plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyChem has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Niagara Falls Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Niagara Falls Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Niagara Falls Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated subst"
