The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the Leesville Gas Processing Plant is to compress, dehydrate and remove natural gas liquids from rich natural gas that is gathered from gas producers in the area.  Inlet gas travels through slug catchers and inlet separators that separate out Condensate liquids via gravity before the overhead gas stream is routed to the Plant.  The Plant consists of refrigeration/cryogenic and treating processes and compressors driven by electric driven motors.  Once at the Plant, the gas is sent through processes consisting of separation, dehydration, and the refrigeration/cryogenic process.  The treated gas is compressed to pipeline pressure via residue compression.  The residue gas leaves the facility via pipeline to be delivered to 3rd party transmission companies.  Natural gas liquids (NGL's) produced in the cryogenic process are delivered to an 8 inch NGL Pipeline that transports the NGLs for further processing at another facility located approximately 15 miles downstream.  The Condensate is stabilized through a heating process and stored in atmospheric storage tanks. Vapors from the condensate tanks are routed to a flare in order to meet emission limits.  The Condensate leaves the plant via tank trucks.  As a result of these operations, several EPA regulated flammable su"

The flammable substance inventory quantity provided in Section 1.17 of the RMP is a conservative estimate of the amount of regulated flammable substance that is present in the Plant at any one time.  This station is manned 24 hours per day/seven days a week. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nAn accidental release prevention program is in place at the Leesville Plant.  The Leesville Plant has been classified as a Program 3 because public receptors have been identified within a calculated radius of exposure.  The Plant is manned 24 hours a day/seven days a week by Operation Personnel who receive extensive Environmental, Health & Safety Training.  Over pressure and high level alarms are in place with shutdown controls for abnormal conditions.  System volumes and pressures are monitored through a Digital Control System (DCS) with an operator stationed at the Control Room for monitoring of systems and alarms.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Leesville Plant started operations on December 9, 2014 and has experienced no known reportable process accidents in the past 5 years.  \n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nUtica East Ohio Midstream LLC (UEO) maintains a written emergency response plan that includes the Leesville Plant, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, the Plant has procedures that address maintenance, in"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Plant processes.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThere are numerous plans in place to fully implement and improve safety and environmental programs.  An environmental, health, and safety (EH&S) training plan has been established and will be fully implemented in 2015.  Emergency drills will be conducted to improve personnel awareness and response.\n\n"
