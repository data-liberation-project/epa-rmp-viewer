The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, Dow Pittsburg emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\nCA Region II LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which the emergency plan for the Dow Pittsburg site has been coordinated and verified. Dow Pittsburg also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies and industrial mutual aid groups, which provide Dow Pittsburg with additiona"

However, several changes are captured in this update as follows.\r\na) 310 Block Operations:\r\n- Increase in chlorine inventory due to interconnectivity with other processes containing chlorine.  The 310 Block Operations does not have an inventory of chlorine above the Federal RMP threshold quantity (TQ) other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in chlorine present above TQ.  \r\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place. \r\nb) 520 Block Operations:\r\n- Reduction of anhydrous ammonia inventory below the Federal RMP TQ due to substantially smaller storage tank.\r\n- Reduction of chlorine inventory, which is still above the RMP TQ, due to storage tanks taken out of service.\r\n- Increase in anhydrous hydrogen chloride (aHCl) due to interconnectivy with other processes containing aHCl.  The 520 Block Operations does not have an inventory of aHCl above TQ other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in aHCl present above TQ.\r\n- The facility is already, and remains, a Program 3 stationary source with accident prevention programs in place.\r\nc) 560 Block Operations:\r\n- Increase in chlorine inventory due to interconnectivity with other processes containing chlorine.  The 560 Block Operations does not have an inventory of chlorine above TQ other than the connection.  But the interconnectivity results in chlorine present above TQ.\r\n- The facility is being now being declared as a Program 3 stationary source due to the connection, but it already had Program 3 accident prevention programs in place. \r\n\r\n15-Jul-2009 - Resubmitted RMP due to a) shutdown of 540 Block process, resulting in total removal of butadiene and acrylonitrile from the site as well as a reduction in aqueous ammonia inv"

Ammonia (anhdyrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Dow Pittsburg site was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nDow Pittsburg maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.  This information is regularly reviewed, as needed, and is readily acessible to plant operations personnel.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nDow Pittsburg conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Dow Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI), Dow Chemical Exposure Index (CEI), Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis (RC/PHA), Hazard and Operability Study ("

Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dow Pittsburg's covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  This information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to plant operations personnel.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nDow Pittsburg has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years, and more frequently as needed, for required process and safety topics.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nDow Pittsburg carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure safe and reliable operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance.  These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nWritten procedures are in place at Dow Pittsburg to safely manage ch"
