In this case the entire contents of the anhydrous ammonia tank (114,900 pounds) are assumed to be released in a gaseous form in a period of 10 minutes.  The conditions of the release consider a stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec., a rural topography, and the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 PPM is 2.32 miles. (Figure 2)\n\nThe alternative release scenario considers a hose failure resulting in the release of 12,000 pounds of ammonia in the gaseous form for a period of 2 minutes.  The stability is Class D with a wind speed of 3 m/sec., the maximum distance to toxic endpoint of 200 PPM is 0.83 miles.\n\n\n\n4.
