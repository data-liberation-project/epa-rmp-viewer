      "SummaryText": "This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, Starmet CMI's Emergency Resonse Plan is implemented with notification to the Barnwell County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have a mutual aid agreement in place with the Fire Department. Both the Fire Department and the LEPC have inspected our facility and have discussed emergency response requirements.\n\nThe Starmet CMI facility is a uranium processing facility that is operated in accordance with SCDHEC Radioactive Material License 322. Propane is used at this facility for fuel to the autoclave boiler, the flare stack and the calcium fluoride dryers.  The propane system consists of six (6) 1,000-gallon tanks, interconnected piping and valves, and associated equipment.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of all six (6) of the 1,000-gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables and the RMP*Comp analysis, the distance to endpoint is 0.2 miles.  Since this facility is located on approximately 320 acres in a remote, unoccupied area the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond the property boundary.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nStarmet CMI has never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injury, property or environmental damage, evacuation or shelterings in place.\n\nStarmet CMI plans no changes to the existing propane system to improve safety at this time."
