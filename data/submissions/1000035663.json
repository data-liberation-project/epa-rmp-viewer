      "SummaryText": "   Rapid City Dealer Fertilizer is a new production facility of liquid fertilizers. It is owned by Kugler Oil Company, of McCook, NE. The Kugler Oil Company is a family owned business, for 85 years, and has been in the production of liquid fertilizers for the past 40 years, at three other locations. They have about 100 full time employees, that includes a full time Safety Director, and the three owners, that are actively involved in the daily operations of the company. Safety and compliance is considered by management as a business objective.\n\n   This facility uses Anhydrous Ammonia in its production, which is considered a regulated toxic substance. Employees are trained on operations of the plant, including working with hazardous chemicals. They are also trained on the importance of safety and the disciplinary action for non-compliance. Safe practices are a condition of continued employment.\n\n   The worst case scenario were based on the amount of product, that could be released from a failure of the largest tank of anhydrous ammonia. The alternate case scenario was based on piping failure, for the same product.\n\n   With this being a new facility, there are no accidents to report. \n\n   The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan. The local fire and police departments will respond to emergencies at the plant. Plant personel will work with responders in caring for emergencies at the plant.\n\n   The Kugler Oil Company also works with the South Dakota Department of Agriculture on state regulations for the design and requirements of fertilizer production facilities.\n\n"
