The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1, et. Seq.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances.  The federal regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  Finally, both CalOSHA and OSHA regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8 Section 5189 and CFR Title 29 Part 1910 Section 119, respectively.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve chlorine and anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility.  Foster Farms removed all liquid/gaseous chlorine processes in early 2000 and replaced them with alternative systems, further demonstrating their commitment to reduce chemical risks.\n\nMany state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility"

      "SummaryText": " as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that an ammonia release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to end the release.\n\nThe C Street Plant and Distribution Center is located at 500/520 C Street in Turlock, California.  Foster Farms purchased the facility in 1982 from the Grange Company.  The main processing building was constructed in the 1950s; the Distribution Center was constructed in 1977.  The C Street Plant and Distribution Center is located on approximately two acres bordered by 5th Street on the east and 6th Street on the west.  The north side is bordered by B Street, and the southern border is D Street.  The areas surrounding the facility consist of residential, industrial, and commercial properties.  Portions of the facility are surrounded by a security fence, prohibiting unauthorized access.  Additionally, the entrance to the facility is staffed by plant security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nOperations at the facility consist of the storage and distribution of poultry products.  The facility receives poultry products from other Foster Farms facilities, and packages them or sends them to other Foster Farms? facilities for further processing.  All processing rooms and cold storage units are cooled by air handling units supplied with ammonia.  The ammonia systems at the C Street Plant and Distribution Center are located in secured rooms, in a fenced area, or on the roofs of the facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in two closed-loop refrigeration systems at the facilities.  The ammonia system for the C Street Plant provides cooling for storage areas, freezers, and ice make"

      "SummaryText": "rs.  The ammonia system for the Distribution Center is used for cooling storage areas.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  Ammonia is used as the heat transfer media in the refrigeration systems.  As the ammonia passes through heat exchangers in the various refrigerated areas or units, heat is transferred to the ammonia thus cooling the air, water, or product that is giving up heat.  The ammonia is then compressed and passes through a condenser where it gives up heat to air and water.  The ammonia cycles back through the heat exchangers to repeat the process.  Anhydrous ammonia is a commonly used industrial refrigerant due to its relatively efficient heat transfer characteristics.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Foster Farms has had no reportable releases within the past five years.\n\nThe RMP regulations also require a review of the accidental release prevention programs and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.\n\nThe predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia systems are continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in the ammonia systems at the C Street Plant and Distribution Center are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility include: \n?emergency shutdown systems\n?component specific safety shutdowns\n?an ammonia leak detection system is instal"

The system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\n\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  Many of the mitigation measures suggested by the previous process hazard analysis team have already been implemented.  Others will be addressed during the next eighteen months.  \n\nThe status of significant mitigation measures for the ammonia refrigeration system is as follows:\n?the review and revision of SOPs is completed\n?Foster Farms tests safety shutdowns annually\n?operator training includes SOPs\n?valve tagging is completed\n?recommendations for equipment inspection and maintenance have been incorporated into the preventive maintenance program\n?high level compressor shutoffs have been installed on recirculator and intercooler vessels\n\nFoster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures.
