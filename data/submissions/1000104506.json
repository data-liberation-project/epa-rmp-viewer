Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nEmergency Response\nCold-Link Logistics has a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of\nhazardous materials. The plan includes aspects of emergency response such as evacuations,\nnotification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident\ndecontamination of affected areas. Only authorized outside personnel (fire department, EMS, etc.) may perform emergency rescue and medical duties. The Sioux City Fire Department is the agency with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Continued training, and program reviews are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. These changes are expected to be implemented in a timely manner."

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Sioux City Fire department which provides emergency response expertise.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled Our facility's primary activities revolve around refrigerated warehousing. Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility. All of the ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Worst case and alternate release scenarios were developed using the methodology given in the EPA RMP*COMP as well as the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration. The details of the chosen scenarios are located within the Risk Management Program that is located on site.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
