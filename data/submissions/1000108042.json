This facility provides blending, packaging, and warehousing of beverage bases and juice beverage concentrates. Multiple institutional packaging sizes include drums (Scholle bags), bag-in-box, 90oz caddy/bottles, Cryovac\u00ae form fill/seal, and 32/64oz gable-top cartons.   We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \n\nThe facility has two separate ammonia refrigeration systems (North Machinery Room and South Machinery Room).  The North Machinery Room is under the 10,000 lb. threshold and is not included in the ammonia inventory listed in 1.17.\n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets. \n\nThe Project Engineer is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs. \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \nAmmonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at this facility. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \nThe facility has an accident release pr"

This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with local fire department officials. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nThere are no changes planned for the system at this time.
