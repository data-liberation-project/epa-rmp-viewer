Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n   \n   Dovex Fruit Company?s accidental release prevention policy involves a unified\n   approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. It is the\n   policy of Dovex to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental\n   regulations.\n\n   Dovex?s emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and\n   training of employees in evacuation and the handling of minor ammonia releases.\n   \n   At Dovex anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is listed on the Extremely\n   Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.\n\nB. Regulated Substance Handled at this Facility\n   \n   Dovex is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 2809 Euclid Ave.,\n   Wenatchee Washington. The facility is located in Chelan County. The main office is     located at 2833 Euclid Avenue Wenatchee Washington.\n   \n   The regulated substance used at Dovex is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7).  The\n   use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 13,167 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system. In addition, smaller (i.e., Less than 10,000 pounds) separate ammonia refrigeration systems exist at the facility.\n\n   Dovex has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an\n   Accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and the \n   surrounding areas.\n \n1. Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design of this\n    equipment and its manufacture.\n2. The facility insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\n3. The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance\n    policies are followed.\n4. Only trained and authorized personnel have access to the system.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nC.

Applicable local fire codes.\n\n   The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to applicable codes and good practices\n   at the time of installation. Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system\n   from moving vehicles. Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards. Other\n   safety devices Dovex utilizes include:\n    1. Computerized controls\n    2. High discharge pressure shut-down\n    3. Low suction pressure shut-down\n    4. Head water high discharge temperature shut-down\n    5. Oil pressure failure shut-down\n    6. Oil Filter plugged shut-down on the screw compressor\n    7. Check valves\n    8. 250 psi relief valves on the high pressure side, vented to atmosphere with 180\n        degree pipedown\n    \n    9. 150 psi relief valves on the low pressure side, vented to atmosphere with 180\n        Degree pipe-down\n    10. Personal protective equipment (PPE) ? Air-purifying respirator, gloves and\n          Goggles\n\n\n   Operating Procedures have been prepared by Dovex for employees\n   performing operational functions.  The operating procedures are kept in the\n   Refrigeration Supervisor?s office. The procedures include:\n    1. Pre-start procedures\n    2. Routine operations\n    3. Maintenance\n    4.
