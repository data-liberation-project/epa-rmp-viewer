Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n   \n   Dovex Fruit Company\u00bfs accidental release prevention policy involves a unified\n   approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. It is the\n   policy of Dovex to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental\n   regulations.\n\n   Dovex\u00bfs emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and\n   training of employees in evacuation and the handling of minor ammonia releases.\n   \n   At Dovex anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is listed on the Extremely\n   Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.\n\nB. Regulated Substance Handled at this Facility\n   \n   Dovex is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 2809 Euclid Ave.,\n   Wenatchee Washington. The facility is located in Chelan County. The main office is     located at 2833 Euclid Avenue Wenatchee Washington.\n   \n   The regulated substance used at Dovex is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7).  The\n   use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 13,167 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the refrigeration system. In addition, smaller (i.e., Less than 10,000 pounds) separate ammonia refrigeration systems exist at the facility.\n\n   Dovex has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an\n   Accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and the \n   surrounding areas.\n \n1. Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design of this\n    equipment and its manufacture.\n2. The facility insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\n3. The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance\n    policies are followed.\n4. Only trained and authorized personnel have access to the system.\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nC.
