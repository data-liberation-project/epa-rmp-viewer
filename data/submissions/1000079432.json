Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 1-26,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 336,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n     This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implementd the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safet"
