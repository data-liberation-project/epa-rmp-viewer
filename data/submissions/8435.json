      "SummaryText": "Lucky Stores, Inc. (\"Lucky\") is a diversified retailer of grocery products. Lucky is a wholly owned operating unit of American Stores Company (ASC, Salt Lake City, UT). Lucky operates many retail grocery stores that are supplied through a number of distribution and transportation complexes located in California, one of which is located in Irvine, Califonia.  The Irvine operation employs over 530 people.  Warehouses are cooled by a 17,800-pound anhydrous ammonia system for refrigeration of food products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), Lucky has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to ammonia.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If? Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed in early 1999 using technical and operations staff from the Lucky facility as well as experienced facilitators from Dames & Moore, an outside engineering firm.\n\nLucky is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Irvine distribution center. Lucky's implementation of the revised PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who"

      "SummaryText": "may be hired to work on the system.\n\nLastly, the PSM written program incorporates the Lucky distribution center's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\nThe Lucky distribution center experienced one indoor release of gaseous ammonia in November of 1996, which resulted in facility evacuation.  Since the incident, measures have been taken to upgrade the refrigeration system equipment as well as revise the standard operating procedures, emergency response plan, and the training program.  As part of the RMP requirements, Lucky undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases of the largest vessels in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\nThe worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 6,580-pound high-pressure receiver located indoors. The analysis of this release indicates that a potential exposure of an area approximately 1.48 miles in diameter (distance to endpoint of 0.74 miles) would result. Local businesses and residences are located within this area. The total population within the potential exposure area is estimated to be 2,164.\n\nIn determining the alternate case scenario for ammonia, Lucky analyzed incidents occurring at other refrigeration facilities and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA).  The scenario chosen for the ammonia system assumes a =\" hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers. Such a release would affect an area of 0.34 miles (0.17 miles to the toxic endpoint) and create the potential to affect approximately 92 persons.  Local businesses and residences are located within this area."
