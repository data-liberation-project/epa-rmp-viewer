      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nSand Springs Water Treatment Plant\nRisk Management Plan\n\nThe Sand Springs Water Treatment Plant (SSWTP) uses chlorine (Cl2) to disinfect processed water and sustain the quality of the water throughout the distribution system. The quantity of Cl2 maintained on-site for this purpose exceeds the threshold limit as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 40 CFR, Part 68, under Section 112 ( r ) of the Clean Air Act. \n\nThe City of Sand Springs and its facilities are devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  This is evident by the established training procedures utilized by the City coupled with the plant improvements currently underway.\n\nThe SSWTP supplies drinking water to both Sand Springs residents and rural water districts.  The treatment process is designed for a production capacity of 10 mgd.  Normal daily operation treats 4 to 5 mgd.  Chlorine is used to inactivate pathogenic organisms in the treated water before distribution and to maintain a chlorine residual within the distribution system to protect the water quality.  The chlorine supply is pulled into the process from one-ton containers under a vacuum.  The presence of the vacuum prevents gas from escaping into the atmosphere incase of potential failure downstream of the vacuum regulator.  This vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which are mounted directly to the ton containers, eliminating gaseous pressure piping in the system.  The gas is then mixed into a water solution and fed into the process. \n\nThe impact areas for both the worst case and alternate release scenarios were based on the results from RMP*Comp.  The worst case release scenario considered a one-ton release within a 10-minute period.  This resulted in a 1.3-mile radius, which could impact an estimated population of 5,623 persons if the entire area is affected.  No active or inactive mitigation was considered in this scenario.  \n\nThe alternate release scenario was based on a gas "

      "SummaryText": "release created by improper sealing of a leaking or broken valve.  No gas is able to escape downstream of the regulators due to the vacuum feed method from the one-ton container because the rest of the system operates either under a vacuum or in a solution.  A valve break at the container could result in a release rate of 15 lbs/min of Cl2.  The impact area of this release was determined by RMP*Comp to have a radius of 0.1 miles.  Based on the Sand Springs population density, an estimated 33 persons may be affected by a release.    \n\nThe chlorine system components at the plant comply with one or more of the following standards: Chlorine Institute, ASTM Standards, ANSI Standards, and ASME Standards.  In addition, consistent maintenance and regular training sessions will minimize the potential for a toxic release.\n\nThe SSWTP has not had any accidental chemical releases within the last five years.  If a release were to occur, the chlorine gas detectors would notify the plant by sounding an alarm.  For a small leak with no potential safety or health hazard, plant personnel would stop the leak wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).  If unable to stop the leak or if the leak were substantial posing health or safety hazard, City personnel would contact local fire/police, Advance Chemical, and other city staff respectively.  Other regulatory agencies would be contacted as required.  The Emergency Planning and Response Team will work with plant personnel to minimize the impact of a release by training and initiating drills to verify preparedness in accordance with the county emergency response procedure manual.\n\nThe plant improvements currently under construction will replace the existing chemical feed system with equipment that will provide the operators with better control of the feed rate. The contractor is under contract to have all improvements completed by January 2001."
