      "SummaryText": "ocessing facility for crude oil and natural gas produced from outer continental shelf (OCS) platforms Hermosa, Hidalgo and Harvest. Due to requirements to reduce emissions and declining field production, several significant modifications have been made to GOHF to extend the economic life of the project. These modifications consisted of the de-permitting of all gas processing equipment and the removal from service of much of the oil processing equipment. With the exception of a small volume of natural gas delivered to the GOHF through existing pipelines for use as fuel gas, platform natural gas production that was formerly processed at GOHF is currently reinjected at the platforms or utilized as platform fuel. The crude oil is processed on the platforms prior to shipment to the GOHF. The only treatment occurring at GOHF is the heating of the crude to pipeline quality specifications prior to delivery to the All American Pipeline Pump Station (AAPL) located adjacent to the GOHF.\nThe GOHF has the capacity to handle 30,000 barrels per day (BPD) of stabilized, dry, sweet crude oil of about 20 degrees (\u00b0) API. However, current foreseeable production is estimated at 10,000 BPD of crude oil or less. The crude oil enters the plant at 59 \u00bf 70\u00b0F and is heated to 120 \u00bf 130\u00b0F. The plant does not need to treat the crude because it meets pipeline specifications for hydrogen sulfide, water, and vapor pressure as it leaves the platforms.\nThe main process equipment at the plant includes vessels, pumps, heat exchangers, and other related equipment used for heating the oil. The main tanks consist of the following:\n\u00bf\tA 10,000 barrel tank for dry oil awaiting shipment to pipeline (T-1)\n\u00bf\tA 1,300 barrel oily water tank (T-25)\n\u00bf\tA 3,000 barrel skimmed oil tank (T-8)\n\u00bf\tA 40,000 barrel standby tank (T-2) for off-spec oil and emergencies\nA vapor blanket is maintained in these tanks (containing oil or oily water) using fuel gas make-up near atmospheric pressure.

Under normal operations, the liquid level in T2 is kept low, so there is a relatively large quantity of fuel gas in this tank.\nThe flare system collects and combusts vapors from oil and produced water tanks T-1, T-2, T-8 and T-25 that are served by the VRU system that are not reused for fuel gas, vapors released by pressure safety valves tied into the flare system, and vapors routed to the flare header from plant equipment degassing and gas inerting activities. \nThe flare is steam assisted and is equipped with an igniter system and pilot flame, which is always lit. The steam cools the flare tip and induces oxygen within the combustion zone to ensure complete combustion to reduce the formation of smoke and the release of volatile organic compounds.\nThe design of the GOHF was initially by Chevron and its contractors in the 1980s. The design incorporated a conservative design basis for seismic protection, process instrumentation, and structural/mechanical integrity. Through the last fifteen years, the GOHF has undergone significant process review, including third party (Santa Barbara County SSRRC) auditing, internal process hazard analysis (PHA) and external event review through Chevron and its successor owner, PXP. Since its transition to owner of GOHF, PXP has conducted periodic PHAs to identify potential hazards for methane or flammable mixture releases. An update of the PHA is currently being planned to be conducted this year. This PHA considers external events such as fire, earthquake, and highway hazmat incidents. \n1.5\tWORST-CASE METHANE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nUnder CalARP provisions, the RMP for the GOHF tank blanketing and vapor recovery/flare processes is considered a Prevention Program 1 because of the facility meets the eligibility criteria under Section 2735.4 c of Title 19, Chapter 4.5 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR).

PXP has a detailed computer based incident tracking documentation for the GOHF and the rest of the Point Arguello project. \n1.8\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe GOHF has a comprehensive Emergency Response Plan and a Notification Plan, both of which are coordinated with the local county emergency response agencies. PXP also participates in a Mutual Aid Program for the Santa Barbara south coast oil and gas facilities. The emergency response plan is tested on a regular basis and the plant conducts emergency drills (twice per year) in partnership with the county response agencies and the mutual aid partners. Notifications to local agencies provide assurance that local response agencies are on hand quickly to coordinate the response to any off-site impacts that may occur. The GOHF emergency response plan was last updated on July 27, 2007. \nPXP response operations will be managed and directed by company personnel using the Incidental Command System (ICS) which is used by most public agencies. During the course of an incident or an emergency, the first responder will initially act as the Incident Commander (IC), and the level of response may be escalated based on the judgment of the IC at the time. The first responder and subsequent line managers are expected, and fully empowered by PXP, to act as the IC and direct all termination of the emergency or until relieved by a person of higher authority. \n1.9\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nAt this time, there are no planned changes to the process or operations for methane at the GOHF. However, a process hazard analysis will be conducted by PXP in the second half of 2008. This analysis may lead changes for risk mitigation."

Significant resources have been invested in safety systems since the plant was constructed, and the facility continues to work with the County of Santa Barbara System Safety Reliability and Review Committee (SBCSRRC) to maintain a safe facility. Process safety management has always been the highest priority at the plant. Through this interactions and in house policies, necessary updates to this RMP may be made and logged in the revision log in Appendix A.\n1.3\tDESCRIPTION OF REGULATED PROCESSES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nMethane (a primary component of natural gas) is used at the GOHF in three (3) ways. The primary use is as a fuel in its cogeneration processes that jointly supplies electricity to the grid and its processes, and process heat to the oil. The second use of natural gas is as a tank blanketing agent to mitigate vapors from the heated oil and produced fluids. The third use of natural gas is provide pilot gas fuel for the proper operations of the flare in assisting vapor recovery processes from the tank blanketing, pigging operations, and process upsets. This RMP focuses on the use of methane on the last two purposes (tank blanketing and vapor recovery/flaring). Based on state and federal guidelines and regulations, the use of methane for fuel is an exempt process for the CalARP and federal RMP.\nThe estimated maximum methane stored on-site including fuel is estimated at approximately 24,700 pounds (lbs). Of this amount, there is approximately 14,600 lbs of methane in high pressure fuel gas on-site and 10,100 lbs of low pressure (60 psig or less) methane gas used in tank blanketing and vapor recovery systems. This amount is a conservative estimate based on the assumptions of varying methane content between fuel gas and recovered vapors from the crude oil.\n1.4\tDESCRIPTION OF GOHF AND RECENT MODIFICATIONS\nThe GOHF was originally designed and operated as an oil and gas pr"

      "SummaryText": "by analyzing the off-site consequence of both a worst-case release scenario and other alternative release scenarios.\nThe conditions assessed under the worst-case release scenario are defined in CalARP. The worst-case scenario involves the loss of the greatest amount that can be held in a vessel or pipe, assuming administrative controls. PXP maintains the four aforementioned tanks (T-1 T-2, T-8, and T-25) with fuel gas tank blanketing at a pressure of 1.5 inches water column. This low pressure is viewed as an inherent administrative control to prevent release. This worst-case release must be analyzed, even if there is no credible series of events that could lead to such a release. The loss is assumed to occur over 10 minutes. Credit can be taken for passive mitigation features (such as a physical enclosure), but not for active features (such as human intervention).\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario involves the release of the greatest amount of flammable mixture (methane and other light ends) taking administrative controls into account. For the gas blanketing and vapor recovery system, this would be either: 1) uncontrolled release of vapors from the 2 inch diameter gas feed line to the tanks at 60 psig, 2) vapors released directly from the tanks, or 3) vapors released from the low pressure 8 inch diameter line routed to the flare from the vapor recovery system. PXP reviewed multiple scenarios and identified the tank depressurization of the largest tank T-2 to zero (0) psig (atmospheric) as the worst case release. The mass of flammable mixture released for this scenario is the greatest of the three types of releases. In accordance with U.S. EPA and CalARP RMP requirements, this release is assumed to be a ground-level release that emits the maximum quantity of flammable over a 10-minute period under pessimistic meteorological conditions.\nThe consequence of the flammable mixture release from the tank T-2 depressurization event was estimated for an endpoint of"

      "SummaryText": "1.1\tINTRODUCTION\nThis executive summary of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) reflects Plains Exploration and Production (PXP) planned efforts to manage and minimize the risks associated with the storage and use of approximately 10,100 pounds of methane in the applicable processes located at the Gaviota Oil Heating Facility (GOHF). Methane is the only CalARP-regulated substance used at the Facility. The Facility does qualify for the federal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP (under 40 CFR 68), where the applicability threshold is also 10,000 pounds (lbs) of storage on-site.\n1.2\tFACILITY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICY\nIt is the policy of PXP that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations. To achieve this end, PXP strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. PXP has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at the GOHF. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., personnel training, safety consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.). The company\u00bfs philosophy is to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as non-regulated substances. \nThe Company activates its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities). Protection of the environment is also a high priority. Once the issues of life, safety, and the environmental are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation"
