A PHA was facilitated by internal trained employee using the HAZOP Method (previous submissions were by What If/Checklist method) with the assistance of LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc plant management and staff familiar with the process, operations and maintenance activities at the facility in September 2019.  The results of this review identified a small number of changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the facility.  All recommendations were in place by 12/31/2019.\r\n\r\n4. Operating Procedures\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc has developed and implemented operating procedures that provide instructions and step for conducting activities associated with the formaldehyde solution processes consistent with the safety information.  LRBG CHEMICALS (USA) INC operating procedures include startup, shutdown, temporary, and emergency operating procedures, and describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release.  The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\r\n\r\n5. Training\r\nAll LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc staff currently involved in formaldehyde solution processes have been trained in the classroom and/or during on-the-job training in an overview of the processes and in the operating procedures, as is new staff assigned to the processes.  Training includes emphasis on safety and health, hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years to ensure LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc staff understands and adheres to current operating procedures.  \r\n\r\n5.

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc facility utilizes more than the threshold quantity of 45% formaldehyde solution (14,600 gallons) in the resin manufacturing process, therefore, this facility is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in A\u00a768.150. \r\n\r\nThe LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the facility is subject to Program 3 requirements. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule. All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \r\n\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc first submitted a RMP to USEPA in 1999.  RMP's must be updated and resubmitted to USEPA every five (5) years.  The following information summarizes the LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc 2020 (submitted in 2021) update and resubmission.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \r\n\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc maintains a policy of safe resin manufacturing operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible any hazards associated with the manufacturing processes, and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, their employees, and the environment.   \r\n\r\nThe LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc facility has procedures in place, including both onsite activities and coordination with offsite responders that are to be followed in the event of a formaldehyde leak.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\n\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc facility consists of three main locations where formaldehyde (45% by weight solution) is handled: unloading area outside the facility; a storage tank, and process tanks in which formaldehyde is mixed with urea or melamine to manufacture liquid resins.  \r\n \r\nThe formaldehyde solution is delivered to LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc by tanker truck and is stored in a single storage tank, which is only filled when an enti"

During this period of time, 3 accidental releases of formaldehyde solution occurred that resulted in NO deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.  The 3 releases during this time frame were small quantities, <10 lbs. and handled by internal clean-up and proper disposal procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of formaldehyde solution.  As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR Part 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA PSM. Required elements include;\r\n \r\n1. Employee Participation\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc attempts to ensure employees and their representatives actively participate in the risk management program.  As noted, employees participated in the process hazard analysis and compliance audit.\r\n\r\n2. Process Safety Information\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc has maintained information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment as part of their risk management program at the facility.  The information is made available to employees and contractors who will work in or about the formaldehyde solution process area.  Emergency response planners can also use the information to develop training programs and procedures.\r\n\r\n3.

As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes (i.e., operational modifications, additional training and competency requirements), to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.  The incident investigation report and any changes resulting from the report will be reviewed with all staff members who operate and maintain the applicable system.\r\n\r\n11. Compliance audits\r\nUSEPA's risk management rule requires that LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc complete a compliance audit for its risk management program at least once every 3 years.  The primary goals of conducting a compliance audit are to verify compliance with risk management rule requirements and good process safety practices, identify process safety or program deficiencies and develop corrective actions, and increase safety awareness among LRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc staff.  An internal audit was performed by a trained internal employee (with the aid and approval of an OSHA review of compliance audit procedures) in May 2017.  A complete PHA was completed in September. 2019.  The next planned internal audit date will occur before June 2021.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\r\n\r\nLRBG Chemicals (USA) Inc has an Emergency Action Plan in place that outlines the actions required to respond to a formaldehyde emergency.  The Emergency Action Plan meets the exception listed in 40 CFR 68.90 (b), and therefore the facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95.   The facility has coordinated the plan with the Lucas County LEPC and the Toledo Fire Department and is included in the written community response plan.  The Toledo Fire Department is designated as the first responders in the event of more than an incidental formaldehyde solution release.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis which was conducted in Sept 2019.
