      "SummaryText": "Advance Food Company, in both its' Enid, Oklahoma and Caryville, Tennessee plants utilizes anhydrous ammonia for its product refrigeration processes. The process technology of ammonia refrigeration systems has been in existence for many years and is therefore standardized and not subject to significant change.  Changes in design for the system involve only additions to or modifications of the existing system and its components. The technical design basis for ammonia refrigeration would only be modified by the IIAR, ANSI, ASHRAE, or a similar organization.  Therefore, Advance Food Co. does not directly control management of process technology.\n\nAmmonia is self-alarming by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in any significant health risk). Most mechanical rooms with ammonia storage/process equipment , even well ventilated, may have concentrations around 5 PPM.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1992.  The dominant characteristic of a Group 2 Refrigerant is its toxicity.  Ammonia is self-alarming by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, personnel exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations. Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture in the skin and, in heavy concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe Department of Transportation classifies ammonia as non-flammable.  However, Ammonia is flammable within concentrations of 18 - 25% volume in air.  Oil carried by the ammonia vapors in the process systems lowers this level considerably, and generally 4% by volume in air is considered the safe limit to prevent explosion.\n\nIn recognition of the potential adverse effects of ammonia release both from an employee and public safety perspective, Advance Food Company has instituted Process Safety Management plans at both of the aforementio"

Training under the HAZCOM Standard ( 1910.120 ) is used to familiarize affected employees with the chemicals and how to read MSDS's, however it is supplemented with training in such subjects as:\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n     Reading and using P & ID's in daily routine tasks and emergency conditions\n     Safe Work practices\n     Emergency evacuation and response\nSafety procedures\n     Work authorization activities\n\nAs with all safety training, documentation of employee's participation in the training are maintained on an individual basis.\n\nInitial training is conducted for each employee currently involved in operating a process and for each employee before they are first assigned to operate a process.

As a result, preventative and responsive maintenance is a critical function. Those employees charged with the maintenance of these systems are knowledgeable and undergo continuous training to assure proper equipment function, process efficiencies and and as a result, the safety and security of the systems.  \n\nIn recognition of the physical hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia, written Hot Work and Confined Space Entry programs and associated training are utilized to cover welding or cutting on piping or components of a covered process, and/or entry into a designated permit required space.

This effort identifies and evaluates all changes as \" change in kind \" or majors, and produce documentation of the evaluation.  The results of these evaluations may include procedural changes and require additional training before startup can be authorized.\n\nShould the preventative actions addressed above be insufficient in preventing a system/component failure, the resulting incidents are treated as serious, regardless of the actual outcome.  Advance Food does not measure the level of severity by the outcome, but instead on the recognized potential consequences. In order to effectively address this concern, a response program has been implemented to include the following:\n \nAll incidents and near misses are investigated within 48 hours by a designated team.\nThe root cause ( s ) and factors contributing to the incident are defined.\nWritten corrective recommendations are provided to site management along with a plan to implement the recommendations of the incident investigation team. This report is shared with all affected employees and the documentation is retained for five years.\n\nShould an event result in a loss of ammonia of significant volume, immediate evacuation of the affected areas is initiated in accordance with the site Emergency Action Plan. Depending on the circumstances, trained Advance employees utilizing appropriate levels of protective equipment may affect the required corrective actions. In any situation where this risk is deemed to be of unacceptable risk, outside response agencies (Enid Fire Department in Enid, OK and the Caryville Volunteer Fire Department in Caryville, TN) will respond.
