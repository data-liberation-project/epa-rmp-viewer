EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nWestlake maintains a written emergency response program which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies, and post incident cleanup requirements.  In addition, the site has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facilities.  Affected personnel are informed of changes and trained appropriately.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the site is coordinated with the Southwest LA Mutual Aid Association.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The site has around the clock communications capability with appropriate Mutual Aid officials and emergency response organizations (e.g. fire department).

After operators demonstrate (through tests and skills demonstrations) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nB.7. CONTRACTORS\n\nWestlake uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform site personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with a process overview, information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the site evaluates contractor safety and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nB.8.
