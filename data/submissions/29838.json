Raw materials in the form of wood chips, sawdust, waste paper and pulp arrive from all over the Northwest by truck, barge and rail car.\n\nThe Camas Mill uses the kraft pulping process to convert wood chips and sawdust into brown kraft pulp.  The pulp is then bleached in either of two bleach plantswhich employ chlorine dioxide and peroxide to whiten pulp.  The paper produced at the mill contains a blend of this pulp and secondary fiber recycled from waste paper.\n\nPaper is made on six different machines.  Five of the machines produce towel and tissue grades; one produces communication papers.  The oldest machine dates from 1910, and the newest from 1984.  Daily production ranges from 30 tons per day on the smallest to over 600 tons per day on the newest and largest.  Rolls of paper from machines are sold directly to printers and converters or further processed on the mill site into finished goods.  The mill also operates a pulp dryer to produce baled pulp for internal use and for sale to external customers.\n\nWaste water is treated and discharged to the main channel of the Columbia River.  The clarifier, aeration ponds and waste fiber landfill are located on Lady Island, a 476 acre site separated from the mill by the Camas Slough.\n\nThe Camas Mill employs 1130 people from the local area as well as from the neighboring cities of Vancouver, Washington and Portland, Oregon.  Most processes operate 24 hours a day, 7 days per week and 52 weeks per year.  Production equipment is shut down during scheduled maintenance downs for maintenance, or curtailed during periods of low market demand.  The entire facility is shut down periodically for large scale maintenance and cleaning.\n\nRegulated Substances and Processes\n\nChlorine dioxide is produced in the R8 chlorine dioxide generator for use in the mill bleach plants.  The chemical is produced as a 0.9% solution; for purposes of this"

The mill has three qualified PSM coordinators managing the program.  In addition to the three coordinator positions, a Process Safety Management Steering Committee meets once per month.  The team is made up of hourly and salaried employees and oversees the implementation of all aspects of the PSM program at the mill.\n\n\nES.7  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM AT THE CAMAS MILL\n\nThe Camas Mill maintains a comprehensive written emergency response program, which is intended to protect worker and public safety and the environment.  The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, that could result in a release of a regulated substance.  Procedures are also included for responding to a potential fire or explosion involving  flammable substances.\n\nThe mill employs a full-time emergency response team, which is fully qualified to respond to all hazardous materials events.  Mill personnel are trained in the use of Integrated Command System protocols for responding to emergency situations, and drills are conducted annually to test the ability to respond to spill events.\n\nThe overall emergency response plan is coordinated with the City of Camas Fire Department.
