THE TREATMENT PROCESS UTILIZES TWO CHEMICALS COVERED UNDER THIS STANDARD.  LIQUID CHLORINE IS USES AS A DISINFECTANT TO TREAT THE WASTEWATER AND SULFUR DIOXIDE IS USED TO DE-CHORINATE PRIOR TO DISCHARGE INTO THE WHITEWATER RIVER.\n\n\n\nCHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE IS PURCHASED IN ONE TON CYLINDERS.  SHIPMENTS ARE SCHEDULED SO THAT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT ON SITE IS 8,000 LBS OF EACH.  THE NORMAL AMOUNT ON SITE AT ANY GIVEN TIME IS LESS THAN 5,000 LBS OF EACH.  THE CYLINDERS ARE STORED IN A BUILDING THAT HAS CONTROLLED VENTILATION.  IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE, THE AIR EXHAUST SHUTS DOWN AND CONFINES THE CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE TO THE BUILDING.  THE STORAGE BUILDING CONTAINMENT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE RADIUS AND THE POPULATION AFFECTED.\n\n\n\nTHERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY REPORTABLE ACCIDENTAL RELEASES WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  THIS IS DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE TRAINING THAT ALL EMPLOYEES HANDLING THE CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE RECEIVES.  ALSO A NEW SYSTEM HAS BEEN INSTALLED AND IF A BREAK OCCURS ANYWHERE IN THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICLY SHUT DOWN.  THE AREA IS INSPECTED AND BUMPED MONTHLY BY OPERATIONS AND,  BY CONTRACTOR QUARTERLY. REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS CAN BE DONE BY BOTH ENTITIES AT ANY GIVEN TIME.\n\n\n\nBUILDING IS CLOSED OFF THEN BEFORE SYSTEM IS PUT BACK ON LINE IN SPRING. VENTILATION SYSTEM IS RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION.(VENTING SHOULD OCCUR DURING NORMAL ROTUINE) LIVING WATERS ANNUALLY AND EVERY THIRD WEEK IN MARCH.INSPECTIONS AND REPAIRS OR CORRECTIONS OF ENTIRE SYSTEM AND EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO OPERATION OF CHLORINE AND DECHLOR SYSTEM. IN ADDITION THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS YEARLY INSPECTIONS OF THE AREA AND THE SYSTEM. \n\n\n\nA AUTOMATIC ALARM SYSTEM HAS BEEN INSTALLED AND IF A LEAK IS DETECTED IT PAGES THE OPERATOR ON DUTY AND IT IS ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.  THIS ALARM SYSTEM IS CHECKED MONTHLY. \n\n"
