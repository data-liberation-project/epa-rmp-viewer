The management structure and oversight to ensure safety is documented in the facility's RMP and includes compliance with applicable regulations, codes and standards (OSHA PSM Standard and US EPA 40 CFR 68). \n\nSource and Federal Regulated Substances Description:\nThe Holcim facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, uses a chemical blend of n-pentane and iso-pentane as the blowing agent to produce foam panels to be used as building insulation.  The pentane blend consists of varying amounts of  iso-pentane and n-pentane.  Therefore, in order to be conservative, Holcim filed for both 20,000 gallons of n-pentane and 20,000 gallons of iso-pentane even though no more than a maximum of 20,000 gallons total will be on-site at any given time.  The facility includes raw material unloading and storage, material blending operations, panel production and cutting, product storage, and loading operations.  The pentane blend will arrive by truck and will be stored in a 20,000-gallon horizontal fixed roof tank.  The tank will be maintained under pressure and will be vented back to the supply tanker during unloading.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\nThe facility has implemented a Program Level 3 Program for pentane, as required by the RMP rule, in accordance with the US EPA guidance.  These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to mi"

The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements.  \n\nFive-Year Accident History: \nThe facility has had no RMP reportable accidents or releases of pentane within the preceding five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe facility's Emergency Response Program has been updated to produce the maximum effective response in the least amount of time.  The facility has coordinated response with the local fire station and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that they will respond to any accidental release from the pentane system.  The facility has also established a notification mechanism to ensure the fire station will be properly notified when any response is needed for a pentane release.  Based on this coordination with the local emergency responders, the facility is not required to implement any additional RMP emergency response program requirements.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe facility is committed to ensuring its operations are safe and in accordance with all RMP requirements, and has established a senior manager responsible for RMP development, implementation, and compliance.  This manager is committed to maintain the safety of the RMP covered pentane system through active adherence to the appropriate procedures and codes.  To ensure that the appropriate changes occur as necessary to maintain/improve safety, ongoing hazard reviews, training, audits, maintenance and investigations will be conducted as required by RMP.
