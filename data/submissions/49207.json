In June 2001, Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (MMP) purchased the facility, which has handled Butane and Propane since 1997 without a harmful release. If an emergency were to occur, it is MMP written policy to notify the North Little Rock LEPC and request they respond to the emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   DESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES: The North Little Rock Terminal is a bulk fuel (refined petroleum) terminal facility, occupying 41 acres with 20 above ground storage tanks and seven pressure vessels. The pressure vessels accommodate the receipt of butane and propane and faciliatate subsequent butane blending operations. This is the only regulated process governed by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulated, meeting the NFPA 4 flammability requirements governing RMP.

GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM: The facility is compliant with the elements of Process Safety Management and other employee training programs, along with operating and maintenance procedures. The facility has no \"Trade Secrets\". The butane storage and distribution system is governed by OSHA's PSM regulation. The facility complies with the Federal and State requirements for leak detection of valves, pumps, and flanges. Inspections are conducted and documented to ensure the integrity of the tanks and equipment.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM: The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan. The terminal is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Within the past five years, the process has no accidental releases that have caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). In the event of fire or explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoint may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated within the RMP. The undersigned certifies to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, formed and reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.
