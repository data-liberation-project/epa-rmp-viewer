The stationary source is Giant Distribution Center. which is  located at 1621 Industrial Drive, Carlisle, PA 17013.  The site is owned by Giant Food Stores, Inc. The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia - classification is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. This facility has a current expansion and building project that is scheduled for completion by the endo of November 1999. The existing small ammonia refrigeration sytem will be expanded for additional cold storage space and also to replace an existing freon refrigeration system. The new complete system is included in this RMP with the Process Overview describing the system as it will be, when completed. It will have a total inventory of approximately 26,903 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in its refrigeration system. This process does not meet the requirements of Program 1and is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefor, this RMP is written to meet the Program 3 level of compliance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\nThe facility has a complete Process Management Program in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM). This program includes a process hazard analysis using the what-if techniques.   In addition, there is a five volume PSM program that covers process safety information, operational procedures, contractors, training, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, P& ID's, and refrigeration drawings.

This refrigeration system is a liquid re-circulation system and is designed to operate at an overfeed ratio of approximately 4:1 for all evaporators. Anhydrous ammonia (R-717) refrigerant is a Group II refrigerant. Rotary screw and reciprocating compressors are used in the refrigeration system.\n\nThis facility contains six separate ammonia refrigeration sub-systems:\nMedium temperature system (+14?F @ 27.5 PSIG).\nHigh temperature system (+30?F @ 45.0 PSIG).\nThermosyphon pilot receiver system (95?F @ 181.1 PSIG).\nCondenser system (95?F C.T. 77?F W.B.).\nCompressor medium temperature system (+14?F @ 27.4 PSIG).\nCompressor high temperature system (+30?F @ 55.5 PSIG).\n\nMajor equipment contained inside the engine room includes:\nFour medium temperature compressors (two Frick RWBII-76 's @ 137.7 TR/182.3 BHP and two Frick RWBII-134 's @ 246.4 TR/310.5 BHP ). \nTwo high temperature compressors ( one Frick RWBII-100  @ 263 TR/ 240 BHP and one Frick RWBII-134 @ 350 TR/ 320 BHP). \nOne 84\" dia.x 12'-0\" OAL high pressure receiver.\nOne 66\" dia.x 11'-0\" OAL high temperature pump re-circulator package .\nOne 66\" dia.x 12'-0\" OAL medium temperature pump re-circulator package.\nMajor equipment located outside on the roof includes:\nOne- evaporative condenser: EVAPCO, ATC-485P, 7,130 MBH.\nOne- evaporative condenser: EVAPCO, ATC-1090, 16,023 MBH.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location of  the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. There is a fire sprikler system in the refrigeration machinery room and throughout this facility. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alar"

The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\n\nSUMMARY OF HAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe definitions and parameters for the release scenarios are based on the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration\" as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis. Meteorological conditions also were taken from this source.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the high pressure receiver as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the common use of the high pressure receiver as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on over-filling the vessel causing the released  quantity to be equal to the total  vessel volume with no piping volume included. The distance to Toxic Endpoint for this scenario is 1.5 miles. The population at risk within the area of concern, for this scenario, is 3,693 people.\n\nThe alternative release scenarios evaluated in this hazard assessment include two possible scenarios. First alternate scenario (OCA-2)  is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the largest pressure relief valve with a duration of sixty minutes. The size of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (79.6 lbs/min) with a release duration of sixty (60) minutes. The distance to Toxic Endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 miles. The population at risk within the area of concern, for this scenario, is 96 people. This scenario was not used as the Aternate Scenario in PMP-Submit.\nThe second alternative scenario (OCA-3) is the direct release of liquid from a ? \"  diameter hole/valve in a vessel having an internal pressure of 181.1 psig.

The distance to Toxic Endpoint for this scenario is 0.2 miles. The population at risk within the area of concern, for this scenario, is 192 people.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program, in addition to special requirements stipulated by the EPA.  There are 13 elements to the Accident Prevention Program.\n\nParticipation - Community participation is through coordination and cooperation with the local Fire department and LEPC. Employee awareness is for employees, not directly involved with the process. Involved employees participate directly in reviewing and revising all elements of the PSM/Accident Prevention Program\n\nProcess Safety Information - Process Safety Information includes a wide variety of books and manuals. These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, IIAR safety bulletins; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagrams, safety systems and devices, safe operating limits; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the \"What-if\" technique.  This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up as a corrective action log.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures"
