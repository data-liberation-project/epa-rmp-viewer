This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream Partners' release mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Enable Midstream Partners' policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if an unintentional release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to respond by activating the plant's Emergency Shutdown (ESD) System in an effort to safely avert further unintentional product release, evacuate the release area and to notify local emergency response authorities.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ROGER MILLS GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 10 miles northwest of Elk City in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, operates a propane refrigeration system to assist in extracting liquid petroleum products from rich raw natural gas.  The refrigeration system includes a High Pressure Receiver vessel containing propane, a regulated flammable material.\n\n    \n\nIn order to establish the safest possible environment for our employees and the public, there are no regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity present at the Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant.  It is noteworthy that the Roger Mills Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) assoc"

Within this program, each process is systematically divided and examined to identify risk hazards to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n    \n\nThe Roger Mills Gas Processing Plant primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The HAZOP analysis methodology is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enable Midstream Partners personnel and/or Contractors who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This PHA Team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n    \n\nThe PHA Team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions. Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude/immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks-as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management.  This risk reduction ranking helps to ensure that potential accident scenarios, especially those assigned to the highest hazard risk, receive immediate attention.
