Release occurs inside building. \n\n\n\nThe six Alternate Case toxic release scenarios are briefly described and include: (1) 150# chlorine cylinder release from sheared valve with a distance to end point (urban) of 0.1 miles. Cylinder stored inside building; (2) 150# sulfur dioxide cylinder release from sheared valve with a distance to end point (urban) of 0.1 miles. Cylinder stored inside building; (3) 140# anhydrous ammonia cylinder release from sheared valve with a distance to end point (urban) of 0.1 miles. Cylinder stored inside building; (4) Tote holding 2468# of ammonia liquid (concentration 20% or greater) punctured during movement with a distance to end point (urban) of 0.1 miles; (5) chlorine stored in 1 ton container located in outside fenced area within plant perimeter. Fire exposure causes fusible plugs to open resulting in release with distance to end point (urban) of 0.3 miles; and (6) sulfur dioxide stored in 1 ton container located in outside fenced area within plant perimeter. Fire exposure causes fusible plugs to open resulting in release with distance to end point (urban) of 0.2 miles. \n\nTo ensure a common basis for comparisons, EPA defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint. The alternative release rate is a release that is considered more reasonable or \"more likely.\" EPA's RMP CompTM was the release model used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint which becomes a radius for a circle around the covered process. Residential population within the circle is required to be determined based on available census information; hence, the population number for each scenario is reported as part of this EPA submittal. Since wind direction cannot be anticipated for an accidental release, EPA mandated the circle estimation method. This method greatly "

Throughout the plant, a hierarchy of controls has been implemented (as applicable) including hazard elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment to minimize or eliminate exposure to hazards. The plant has a Process Safety Management (PSM) system for the covered processes as defined by OSHA. The Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Anhydrous Ammonia Processes include the following PSM system elements: process safety information; process hazard analysis; operating procedures; training; management of change; pre-startup safety review; compliance audits; incident investigations; employee participation; hot work permit; contractor management; emergency planning and response. Mechanical integrity program element is not applicable for this plant since it's a warehousing facility. The plant also has a safety management system for the Ammonium Hydroxide Process that includes the following elements: safety information; hazard review; operating procedures; training; maintenance; compliance audits; accident investigations; emergency planning and response. Infrastructure security improvements at designated areas in the plant have been implemented that provide layers of protection against deliberate man-made incidents in accordance with applicable elements of U.S. Department of Homeland Security's CFATS Risk Based Performance Standards.\n\nAlexander Chemical Corporation has an extensive product safety stewardship outreach program for customers including four regional training sessions held recently that was attended by appro"

These regional training sessions continue to be held periodically.\n\nIn the last five years, the Alexander Chemical Corporation, Mason plant has not had any accidental releases that meet the five-year accident history reporting criteria as required in 40 CFR Part 68.168. \n\nThe Mason plant is actively involved in emergency planning activities as a member of the Ingham County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and has implemented an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38. The Mason Plant EAP is derived from the Ingham County LEPC, SARA Title III, Fixed Site Response Plan which includes: means of reporting releases, fires and other emergencies to the Ingham County 911 Dispatch Center; evacuation procedures and emergency escape route assignments; reference to applicable procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; procedures to account for all employees and other personnel on site after an emergency evacuation; rescue and medical duties for employees as appropriate; name(s)of Mason plant personnel or job title(s) who can be contacted for plant information or EAP duties, and information used by off-site responders to bring the emergency under control. The plan is reviewed annually by plant personnel, Mason Fire Department and other outside response agencies as appropriate. The plan is approved as a guideline for response to a hazardous materials incident requiring off-site response at the Mason plant and is consistent with the Ingham County and City of Lansing Emergency Operations Plans. The Mason EAP/Fixed Site Response Plan is exercised by plant management with the Mason Fire Chief determining date, time and type of exercise.\n\nThe PSM Program is reviewed and audited annually with areas for improvement documented and tracked to completion. Warehouse inventory controls have been improved to ensure that only adequate quantities of regulated toxic substances"
