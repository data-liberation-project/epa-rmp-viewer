Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the policy of the Pepperidge Farm Plant in Downingtown, PA to provide working conditions that do not endanger the safety or health of its employees or the environment.  All members of management are expected to actively participate in the safety program.  The program is designed to establish and maintain safe and healthful working conditions. \n\nA key element in the Plant Safety Plan is the Plant Safety Structure.  This safety structure involves coordination of safety activities between a Central Safety Committee, Proctor Meetings, and regular Safety Audits.\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the Plant Safety Plan.  Pepperidge Farm takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Safety Manager is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nPepperidge Farm's Downingtown Plant produces frozen food products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide freezing and cooling for the food products produced.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Downingtown Plant.\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.
