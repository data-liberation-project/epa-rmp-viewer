      "SummaryText": "Country Delite Farms plant processes fluid milk.   The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of fluid milk within the facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of a high pressure vessel, evaporators, compressors, piping and other refrigeration equipment.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:   Country Delite Farms is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area.  The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and EPA's Risk Management Program Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system.  In addition, there programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  As a part of the PSM program, Country Delite Farms plant has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  There programs include:\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOperating Procedures\nTraining\nMechanical Integrity\nManagement of Change\nPre Startup Safety Review\nCompliance Audits\nIncident Investigation\nEmployee Participation\nHot Work Permits\nContractor Safety\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 which will notify the local fire depatment and hazmat team has included the Country Delite Farms plant in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:"

      "SummaryText": "  Country Delite Farms plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  In addition, Country Delite Farms will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program."
