One system consisting of 14,800 lbs., controls' temperatures in the Freezer.  The second system is a 6,000 lb. capacity controlling the temperature in the Perishable building.\n\nThe Freezer has frozen product, i.e.; meat, ice cream, vegetables, breads, cakes, pre-packaged meals and anything else that can typically be found in the frozen department of any grocery store.  The Perishable building products are those items that need temperature control but should not be frozen.  These items might be packaged meats, dairy products and poultry.\n\nFor a \"worst case\" release, we used the OCA guidance.  The release impacts schools, businesses, and residential housing.  The operating level limits the tank to 25% of total capacity.\n\nThe alternate release was also in the 5-year accident history.  As a result, we have moved all the freezer piping to the roof and plan on moving the cooler piping to the roof in CY2000.  We also met with the Xenia Fire Department and discussed what could be done better.  We believe that we have a much improved plan today from when we had the accident.\n\nFor the Emergency Response Program, we have three (3) people who completed the 24-hour Emergency Response Training course, and plan on sending 3 additional people in November 1999.  We now have purchased four (4) S.C.B.A. units.\n\nPSM and RMP, as well as many safety policies within our facility, enable us to prevent the occurrence, minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia, as well as fire"

Additional, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical that is over the threshold quantity.  Other hazardous materials are in-house, but in quantities below their threshold level.  Regardless, accepted industry safety practices, such as MSS sheets, proper storage, personal protective equipment, etc., is used religiously.  These products are typical of what one would find in a maintenance shop servicing a building or related fork truck type equipment.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system consists of compressors, vessels, condensers, evaporators and pumps, and are interconnected into one system.\n\nWe believe our safety programs prevent accidents due to our focus on rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, work performed, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and updated as necessary.  Employees are included in the \"Management of Change\" or rule changes."
