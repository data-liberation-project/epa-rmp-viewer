The facility is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nThe Wildcat Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Wildcat Gas Plant is located approximately 5.70 miles northwest of Wink, Texas on FM1232 and operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as natural gas liquids)\n\n2. Condensate\n\n\n\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components.  The regulated flammable substances include these same components.  This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nSeveral vessels at the plant were evaluated for the offsite consequence analysis.  There is one worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substa"

The entire inventory of this vessel is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion and impacting an area with a 0.6-mile radius.   The facility is not located within a populated area; however, there is a well pad with active truck loadout to the southwest. Therefore, the WCS has the potential to affect a public receptor and is considered part of a Program 3 process.  A consideration of the 0.6-mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the Wildcat Gas Plant is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 210,000 pounds of NGLs. This release was modeled as ethane, which is the primary constituent by mole fraction in the NGLs.  The release results from the improper open or closure of a valve causing overpressure between LCV-4405A and Valve 770 with rupture of the 6-inch pipeline. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.3 miles, which includes an offsite endpoint but not the nearby public receptor. There is no ARS that is more likely than the WCS that would also impact the manned well pad.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Wildcat Gas Plant is covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to aid in accident release prevention.\n\n\n\nA. Employee Participation\n\n\n\nTarga encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\n\n\n1. Updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\n2. Performing necessary calculations for PSM and RMP\n\n3. Maintaining good engineering practices\n\n4. Participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\n\n\n\nEmployees have access to all information pertaining to the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nB."

Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\n\n\nThe location of the technical documents referenced above is listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM Program.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  For specific areas within the process, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual.  The plant maintains the overall process within these limits by using controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed facility changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \n\n\n\nC.

There have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Wildcat Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).  The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs.  However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.  The Wildcat Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe Area Manager has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety.
