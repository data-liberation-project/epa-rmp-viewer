A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED.    THE PREMARY PURPOSE OF THIS FACILITY IS STORAGE OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.                                                                                                                                                  3.
