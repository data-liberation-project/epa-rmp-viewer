Facility self-designation as non-responding is recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Non-responder status was established as a risk ceiling for employee response.  Under no circumstances shall personnel jeopardize their health and safety or that of others in responding to an emergency. In responding, employees shall not exceed significantly the level of risk to which they normally are exposed and acclimated in their workplace.  \r\n\r\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\r\n\r\nDoswell Energy Center is an independent electric power production facility. The Complex consists of two combined cycle units and one peaking unit. Each combined cycle unit consists of two combustion turbines, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), one steam turbine, one air-cooled condenser, and their plant support equipment.  The Facility consists of single simple cycle combustion turbine. The primary fuel is natural gas with light distillate fuel oil as a backup fuel. \r\n\r\nThe Doswell combined cycle units use anhydrous ammonia to control nitrous oxide emissions from the burning of fuel oil and gas for electric power production.  The ammonia is stored as a liquid under pressure, which is vaporized and mixed with air before being injected into the Selective Catalytic Reduction unit on each Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG). The ammonia is stored in two, 10,000-gallon tanks, which have a total capacity of 103,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nPrevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nDoswell is a Program 3 facility under the classification system in 40 CFR 69, and it has a prevention program that meets the regulatory requirements. \r\n  1.

The Facility's Operating Procedures include the Ammonia System Normal Startup, Operations, and Shutdown Operating Procedure, the Ammonia Receiving and Unloading Procedure, and the Ammonia Storage and Supply System Description.  Procedures are reviewed and revised regularly or as a result of the Event Response process.\r\n  4. Training is defined in the Ammonia Safety and Training Program. All personnel who may be involved with the handling or maintenance of anhydrous ammonia product or equipment shall receive safety training.  This training will be conducted and documented before an employee is allowed to work around the anhydrous ammonia product or equipment. \r\n  5. The ammonia system and equipment was designed and constructed according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards. Maintaining the Mechanical Integrity of the ammonia system is accomplished through Facility procedures and the computer based maintenance system. Preventive maintenance (PM) work orders are issued on a periodic basis established by equipment manufacturers and equipment history. \r\n  6.
