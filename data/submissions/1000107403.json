The Stationary Source maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidently released. If Stationary Source employees take part in responding to accidental releases, then the Stationary Source is required to periodically review and update, as appropriate, the Stationary Source\u0092s emergency response program and notify employees of any changes to the emergency response plan (40 CFR 68.95). Updates should include the date of the most recent review of the emergency response program and most recent training. The Stationary Source is also expected to contact the Local Emergency Planning Committee to verify whether the Stationary Source is currently included in the community emergency response plan. Section 9 of the CDX RMP Submit Document (Appendix 4) provides updated information (including dates and other pertinent details) that was reviewed by the Stationary Source to ensure that the procedures for the emergency response program have been updated and verified.\n\nGeneral Duty Form\nPrevention of Accidental Release\nStationary Source:\tCedar Bayou Tank Farm \nEPA Facility Identifier: 1000 00023 3133\nCompany:\tEnergy Transfer \nSubstance:\tFLAMMABLE MIXTURE\n                ?\tFlammable\n\t        ?

These steps include:\n\u0095\tVerification of program applicability;\n\u0095\tVerification of chemical quantities in each process and largest vessel quantity;\n\u0095\tCompletion of the off site consequence analysis and impacts; and\n\u0095\tUpdate of the five year accident history\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nAccording to 40 CFR 68.42, \u0093The owner or operator shall include in the five-year accident. \nhistory all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\u0094\nThe Stationary Source has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nVERIFICATION OF PROCESS INFORMATION\nFacilities have an ongoing responsibility to monitor whether changes to any process or to the quantities stored or handled alter the Stationary Source\u0092s program level eligibility. A 5-year renewal also gives the Stationary Source personnel the opportunity to verify that each covered process still meets the eligibility criteria for its program level. Based on information regarding the type and quantity of stored/handled chemicals currently onsite, it was verified that the Stationary Source process areas are Program 1 processes under the ARP Program (40 CFR 68).\n\nREVIEW OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Stationary"
