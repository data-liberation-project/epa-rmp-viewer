      "SummaryText": "The Athens Utilities Board owns and operates the Vernon Wade Water Treatment Plant (WTP) which is located in Athens, Tennessee.  The system serves an estimated population of 17,706 individuals.  The WTP has a design capacity of approximately 4 MGD and utilizes chorine for disinfection prior to water being pumped into the distribution system.  Current chlorine management practices involve two, one-ton cylinders being stored or operated at the facility.  The two cylinders are connected with an automatic switchover device.  Therefore, 4,000 pounds was the maximum limit used for RMP reporting purposes.  Chlorine is the only chemical utilized at the WTP above 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities.  There are no flammable chemicals or substances stored at the WTP.  This facility is also regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  These involve implementing operational and maintenance procedures that limit the risk of an accidental release such as those modeled in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) portion of the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP).  PSM requirements also involve working closely with local emergency response personnel to limit the consequences of an accidental release were one to occur.  The Vernon Wade WTP has a schedule in place that requires periodic inspections of equipment used to load/unload chlorine, feed chlorine in our water treatment process, and monitor the atmosphere for chlorine leaks.  These inspections are documented by operating personnel and minimize the potential for equipment malfunctions or faulty cylinders that could lead to chlorine releases.  Operational procedures are also in place that outline specific steps to take when chlorine is loaded or unloaded, when putting a chlorine cylinder into service, when taking a chlorine cylinder out of service, and for normal operation.  These attempt to minimize operator errors that could cause a chlorine accident.  There are also preventative maintenance procedures in pl"

      "SummaryText": "ace where tubing and chlorination system parts are regularly replaced to minimize the potential for mechanical malfunctions that could cause chlorine releases.  Additionally, this facility has emergency procedures in place in the event a chlorine release should occur.  These specifically outline the steps that operators, management, and administrative personnel should take when an accidental release is discovered.  Periodically, emergency drills are performed in conjunction with local emergency response agencies, like the McMinn County Hazmat team and the Athens Fire Department.  The latest drill was conducted at the Vernon Wade Water Treatment Plant on June 3, 2004.  Periodic training is also performed at the facility, where inspection, maintenance, and operational procedures are reviewed with plant operators.  This training serves not only to ensure our PSM operation, maintenance, and emergency response procedures are fully understood and being followed, but to identify any areas where current procedures need to be revised or new procedures implemented.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is also conducted periodically to identify situations that could cause a chemical release and to plan specific actions that would be taken to either minimize the chances for the situation to occur or mitigate the effects of a chemical release."
