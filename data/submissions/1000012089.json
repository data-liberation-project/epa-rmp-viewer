Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar Energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary.\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request.\nWe will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employee\u00c2\u00bfs level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\nThe McPherson Station was built and put into service in 1974. The Butane addition was added to the station in 2007. The facility was built to store and transport butane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The butane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via an 8\u00c2\u00bf and an 10\u00c2\u00bf pipeline, to the McPherson Station from the NuStar Terminals in Augusta and El Dorado Kansas. The 1,680,000 lbs. of butane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of four, pressurized \u00c2\u00bfbullet\u00c2\u00bf tanks. The LM is stored in one of the pressurized \u00c2\u00bfbullet\u00c2\u00bf tanks. The butane is transferred out of the station via pipelines to other NuStar Terminals downstream.\nThe McPherson Facility complies with many different regulatory agencies, which include, but not limited to;\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (1910.119) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Action Plan Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.38(c).\n\u00c2\u00bf\tOSHA\u00c2\u00bfs HAZWOPER Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\u00c2\u00bf\tFederal Oil Pollution Act of 1990: U.S. DOT Final Rule for Transportation Related On-Shore Faciliti"
