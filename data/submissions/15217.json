      "SummaryText": " 1.  ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  We at Ulrich Chemical, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidential release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely corrdinated with the Peoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Bartonville Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n     2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  Ulrich's primary activities encompass chemical repackaging warehousing and distribution.  Currently, there are 2 regulated substances present at this facility.  These substances are Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  At this time, the maximum inventory for Chlorine is 112,400  lbs. and Sulfur Dioxide is 5,150 lbs..  However, due to the nature of our industry, maximum inventory volumes will fluctuate upon customer demand.\n\n     3.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO(s) & ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO(s): To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for this facility, we have used EPA's RMP*Comp program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     The worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from chlorine.  The scenario involves a release of 2000 lbs. of chlorine, in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures have been taken into account in calculating this scenario.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance o"

The scenario involves a gaseous release of 200 lbs. over 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures have been taken into account in calculating this scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include utilization of the chlorine salvage cylinder or emergency A or B kit to mitigate the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087mg/l is 0.1 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide involves a release from a storage container.  The scenario involves a gaseous release of 200 lbs. over 60 minutes.   Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures have been taken into account in calculating this scenario.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by active mitigation measures that include utilization of sulfur dioxide gasket and the chlorine emergency A or B kit to mitigate the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078mg/l is 0.1 miles.\n\n     4.  THE GENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidential release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are both subject to OSHA's PSM standard as set forth under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at this facility.\n\n     a). Process Safety Information: Ulrich Chemical, Inc. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all regulated processes.\n\n     b).
