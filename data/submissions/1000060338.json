      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Butterball, LLC of Mt. Olive are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our refrigeration personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with Pleasant Grove Volunteer Fire Department, Oak Wolfe Volunteer Fire Department, Duplin County LEPC, and State of NC Hazardous Materials Regional Response Team, which provide additional emergency response.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities revolve around the further processing and distribution of poultry products.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility.  The entire ammonia inventory is attributed to its use as a refrigerant within two separate systems.\n\n\n\nThe inventory of ammonia for System #1 at our facility is 113,005 pounds for System 1, with a maximum system total of 236,201 pounds of ammonia.  The inventory of ammonia for System 2 is 39,995 pounds, with a maximum system total of 72,550 pounds.  The total site ammonia inventory quantity is 153,000 pounds, with a maximum system total of 298,751 pounds. \n\n\n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for ammonia we have used the methodology given in the Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration by "

      "SummaryText": "SAIC.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for the Program 3 toxic substance as a class involves an unmitigated catastrophic release of ammonia used as a refrigerant.  The scenario involves the release of 113,005pounds of ammonia in a gaseous/liquid form over 10 minutes from the facility's High Pressure Receiver. This is 76% of the volume the HPR can hold onsite. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 5.6 miles radius is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\n\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in the Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for ammonia involves a release from a threaded cracked relief valve in the ammonia refrigeration process.  The scenario involves the release of 4.17 lbs/hr of ammonia in a vapor form over 60 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of ammonia is 0.1 mile radius.  \n\n\n\n\n\n 4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  In addition, our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.
