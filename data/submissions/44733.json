This\n\ndocument provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk\n\nmanagement activities that we have designed and implemented,\n\nincluding:\n\n\n\n-A description of our facility and use of substances\n\nregulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n-A summary of results from our assessment of the potential\n\noffsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\n-An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n-A five-year accident history of accidental release of\n\nchemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n\n\nOur facility produces a water based Acrylic Emulsion used in\n\nthe Industrial Coatings Industry as well as some products\n\nused for paper coatings.  In our process, we use the\n\nfollowing chemicals that EPA has identified as having the\n\npotential to cause significant offsite consequences in the\n\nevent of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n\nToxic Chemicals:\n\n\n\nVinyl Acetate\n\nVA is received via rail car and is stored as a pressurized\n\nliquid in horizontal tanks capable of holding 165,000lbs.\n\n(we have 2 tanks)  Procedures are in place so that we do not\n\noffload a rail car until it can fit into the tanks.  There\n\nare several manual and automatic safety devices in place,\n\nand the tanks are vented to a flare system.  All offloading\n\nis done via a closed loop system so that all vapors are\n\ncontained.  All offloading is continuously monitored until\n\ncomplete, and there is a containment under the railcar which\n\nis piped to a secondary containment pit which can be\n\nisolate"

The accident scenarios found\n\nin HAZOP's form the basis of additional analyses which allow\n\nus to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective\n\nsystems are high enough to protect both our employees and\n\nour neighbors.

We not only have our own\n\nplan and training, but we contract with the larger Rohm and\n\nHaas Texas plant next door for Fire and Emergency Response\n\nServices.  We also coordinate our plan with the community\n\nemergency response plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are panning\n\nto implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better\n\nrespond to accidental chemical releases.\n\n\n\nAs of the time of submittal, we have a plan to take our fire\n\nprotection for the AN storage to the next level which\n\nincludes a permanent foam addition system.\n\n\n\nCertifications\n\nWithin the past five years, the process has had no\n\naccidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in\n\nthe RMP rule (40 CFR 68.10 (b) (1)).  No additional measures\n\nare necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental\n\nreleases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of\n\na regulated substance from the process, entry within the\n\ndistance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to\n\npublic emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency\n\nresponders should not enter this ar"
