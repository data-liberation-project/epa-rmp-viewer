This WWTP (0.4 MGD) is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) which is a Government Agency.  PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substance used as for water disinfection: Chlorine.  The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  The Prevention Program was prepared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release:\r\nIt is PRASA policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements. Chlorine is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason Guanica Treatment Plant is observing the appropriated engineering controls.  Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implanted to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substance handled.\r\nGuanica Treatment Plant is located close to the Mar Caribe where the plant discharges the treated water.  The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy the microorganism that could cause illness in humans and contamination of the beach.\r\nThe chlorine is delivered from the PRASA Storage Center at Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers.  Guanica Treatment Plant could has a storage maximum volume of 8,000 lbs distributed in four (4) containers.  Two containers are connected to chlorinators only from one in used (15-20 pounds per day) the chlorine flows to the chlorinator valve through a flexible pipe, and ends to injector. Combined the used water with chlorine to complete the process and discharge. \r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario:\r\nThe Worst Case Scenario was determined as indicated in the EPA Wastewater Treatment Plan"

      "SummaryText": "t, as per Appendix F Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.  This guidance considers the release of the Chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 lbs) during 10 minutes and other specifications related to the weather conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, which is the American Industrial Hygiene Association exposure limit above which it is determined human health will be affected.  Using the Landview 6 Simulator and the US Census 2010, it was identified that 4,874 residents are inside the 1.3 miles radio. Schools, Church, Hospital, are inside downtown and the simulator radio (1.3 miles) includes Guanica downtown.  No known environmental receptors beside the beach (state parks, or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area.  The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\r\n\r\nAlternative Case Scenario:\r\nThe more realistic scenario was also simulated as per EPA Wastewater Treatment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 lbs container, but throughout a 3/8 inch pipe leak.  In such case the end point distance is calculated as 0.1 miles and none public receptors were identified over the most recent map.  No known environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program \r\nPRASA is actually performing maintenance activities to the chlorine system.  The employees perform periodic inspections and maintenance procedures are followed which will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans.  Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) are already in place to comply with the RMP Program, OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous and risk related to the chlorine.  List of all SOPs are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nPRASA"
