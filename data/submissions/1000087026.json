Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of phosphorus and potash for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 485,000 pounds in 53 tanks.  The capacities of each of these tanks are: (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank, (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks, and (50) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of total contents of the storage tank released as a liquid spill and vaporization over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tanks and 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on TFI Degadis is not released per US EPA\n\n\n\n    The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from a transfer hose failure, with 13,319 pounds release over 2 minutes. Distances not released per US EPA\n\n\n\n4.
