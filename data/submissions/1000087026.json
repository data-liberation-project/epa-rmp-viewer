The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Brandt Agronomic Services LLC(Towanda) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should and accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.    Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of phosphorus and potash for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 485,000 pounds in 53 tanks.  The capacities of each of these tanks are: (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank, (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks, and (50) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of total contents of the storage tank released as a liquid spill and vaporization over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tanks and 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion based on TFI Degadis is not released per US EPA\n\n\n\n    The alternative-case release scenario is assumed to be a release from a transfer hose failure, with 13,319 pounds release over 2 minutes. Distances not released per US EPA\n\n\n\n4.    The accidental release program:  The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia and Low Pressure Nitrogen Solutions, Equipment, Containers, and Storage Facilities.  These regulations administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture \n\n\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases "
