It strives to maintain a safe workplace.  Our farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan for prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  One of the activities of this company is the retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as fertilizer for crop production.\n\nOur plant consists of two A? 11,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tanks and one 30,000 gallon.  The maximum quantity stored (filled at 85%) is 225,420 lbs.

This would add an additional 109892 pounds of product ( filled at 85%).  This makes a total storage capacity of 316,455 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored at the Oswego Anhydrous Plant.\n\nOur plant is operated and maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations.  The employees who work in the facility are training at a state school every three years and company wide on a yearly basis on the proper procedures to operate the plant, as well as the procedures to full a nurse tank.
