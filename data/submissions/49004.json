      "SummaryText": "     The City of Groves (Herein referred to as the City)is owned and operated by the city. The city stores and uses chlorine gas at this facility for disinfection of the public drinking water supply.  The City recognizes it's obligation as an owner /operator to not only make provisions for the safehandling and storage of hazzarous chemical releases.\n\n     The City has developed thorough water plant design and procedural implementationan operation conducive to chemical leak prevention, detection, and response.  The City has run consequence analysis scenarios using RMPCOMP  software to project the impact of both catastrophic and alternitive releases.  The City has coordinated with  local emergency management officials, including the Groves Fire Depatment and has trained it's own staff to respond to emergercies.  There are typically eight one ton cylinders on site in an isolated building dedicated strictly to chlorination.  All of the cylinders, regulators, rotor meters, and gas lines are houseed within the chlorination building so that, in the event of a release, chlorine gas will have a limited exposure to the outside environment.  Leak detectors are mounted inside the buildingand linked to a SCADA system for early leak detection and response. Training, inpection, and maintenance procedures have been implemented to prevent and mitigate chlorine releases.  The City's Risk Management Plan addreses the risks associated with chlorine use in the treatment process and reflects the management's dedication to maintaining a safe operation for the employees and the community."
