These precautions include safety controls (detection systems, alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nLakeside Foods Jay Street located in Manitowoc, WI processes various vegetable products. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, are used in closed-loop refrigeration systems for product cooling and freezing. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, an integrated safety management program has been established to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\r\n\r\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Lakeside Foods Jay Street facility.\r\n\r\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\r\n\r\nThe Lakeside Foods Jay Street facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule.

Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that activate if ammonia is detected.  The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Manitowoc Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to assist in the response.  Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\r\n\r\n5.\tFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\n6.\tEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis food processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\r\n\r\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nLakeside Foods Jay Street expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of its PSM/RMP program.
