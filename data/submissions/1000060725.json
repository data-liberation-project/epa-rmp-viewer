It is the intent of South Jersey Terminal to incorporate the most recent construction and procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2011) into this process.  \r\n\r\nSouth Jersey Terminal provides for the transfer of liquefied butane (normal, iso, and mixed), propane, propylene, and  propane - propylene mix. (hereafter referred to as LPG) under pressure from stationary (detached from locomotive) pressure tank/rail cars. The LPG is transferred to storage vessels via transloading towers. In addition, liquid transfers can occur directly from the railcars via transloading towers to transport vehicles without prior transfer to a storage vessel.  The stored liquefied gases are loaded to transport vehicles from the storage vessels via loading stations.  Most of these stations use fixed facility equipment for transfer power, but two of the stations at the former Modern Gas setting, use the truck pumps to provide pressure for the liquid transfer. Liquid transfer is also available via unloading stations for transport vehicles to offload primarily in the case of over loading for most tanks, but the Modern Gas tanks can only be filled via transport.  They are not hard piped to the rail load system. For modeling purposes, the flammable mixture was modeled as butane, the component of single greatest consequence.\r\n\r\nEmergency Contacts\r\nThere are two Crestwood employees who serve as the primary emergency contacts during off hours: the Terminal Supervisor and the Senior Environmental, Safety, and Regulatory Adviser. Both employees can be reached 24 hours per day and are local to the facility.\r\nEmergency planning has started with the local fire department and Office of Emergency Management.\r\nAn"

There is a copy of the written plan in the office trailer. The Terminal Supervisor is charged with implementing the plan. The employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\r\nAn e-mail is sent to the employees as a reminder twice per year asking them for their suggestions and input for the risk management program. Additionally, the Terminal Supervisor maintains an open door policy, and the operators may make suggestions at any time. There is a daily tool box meeting covering environmental, safety, and health issues at which any questions or suggestions regarding risk management can be raised.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe required Process Safety Information has been accumulated by the Engineering Department, is stored on site, and is available to employees. The process safety information was also available during the completion of the process hazard analysis. The Terminal Supervisor is responsible for maintaining the process safety information.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe initial process hazard analysis using the HAZOP methodology was completed on January 7, 2013. Non-critical recommendations were developed from the process hazard analysis. The process hazard analysis and list of recommendations are stored on site.
