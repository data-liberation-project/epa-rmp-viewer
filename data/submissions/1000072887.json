              "Description": "Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck and railcar, stored in four 30,000 gallon tanks and distributed to SCR control equipment to reduce NOx emissions. The prevention program includes assuring all process equipment and materials meet appropriate standards and code requirements, implementation of detailed safe operating procedures, and effective mechanical integrity program, and an extensive training program to assure that all personnel are thoroughly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia system. Process controls include relief valves, check valves, automatic and manual shutoffs, excess flow devices, emergency power source, interlocks, alarms and procedures. Sudden surges in flow or pressure will cause strategically located automatic shutoff valves to close and isolate the system. Water fogging sprays located at relief valves and unloading station can be automatically activated by area monitoring devices triggered at preset concentration limits or manually activated by control room operators or storage facility operators. Area at storage facility is graded to contain runoff for treatment.",

TVA is committed to setting the standard for environmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee Valley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management. TVA assures that employees are aware of their\n\nenvironmental responsibilities, use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for performance.\n\n\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and\n\nstriving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties. We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which we operate through proper environmental review of new\n\ndevelopments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness. All activities will be\n\nconducted in accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nII.

The Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis\n\nmethodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified\n\npersonnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations. Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The HAZOP analysis was conducted on August 13-15, 2001 and April 16-17, 2003 and a pre-startup HAZOP\n\nreview was conducted on December 10, 2003.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within our\n\ncovered process. The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal\n\nshutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or\n\nemergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the\n\nprocess and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\n\n\nTraining: TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the\n\noperation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and\n\nknowledgeable of the hazards of the process. The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  TVA conducts well documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure "

All maintenance operations conducted on the covered process are performed by qualified personnel who have had proper training.  Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures\n\nand monitoring technology which assures that any changes meet regulatory requirements. Personnel whose job tasks are\n\naffected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review: A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process. Established prestartup safety review procedures assured that construction and installation of covered process equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will determine whether the\n\nprovisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The audits will be conducted at least every 3 years and\n\nany corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations:  Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.
