The Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis\r\nmethodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process. The study was conducted by a team of qualified\r\npersonnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations. Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed. The HAZOP analysis was conducted on August 13-15, 2001 and April 16-17, 2003 and a pre-startup HAZOP\r\nreview was conducted on December 10, 2003.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within our\r\ncovered process. The procedures cover various operational phases including initial startup, normal startup, normal\r\nshutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or\r\nemergency shutdown. The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the\r\nprocess and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\r\n\r\nTraining: TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the\r\noperation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and\r\nknowledgeable of the hazards of the process.
