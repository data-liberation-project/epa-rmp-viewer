We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\nA. Description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP rule\r\nB. Overview of our accidental release prevention programs\r\nC.

STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Sunoco Race Fuels Blend unit is located on a portion of Energy Transfer's Marcus Hook Terminal.  The unit is located in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania.  The Race Fuels Blend unit blends various hydrocarbons to produce motor fuels with the necessary octane levels and other properties specified by various racing car associations.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a major accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThe Race Fuels Blend unit does not use, store, or handle any toxic materials covered by the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nThe Race Fuels Blend unit has one flammable material which exceeds the threshold quantities in the RMP regulation, isopentane.

The fourteen   (14) elements of PSM constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit.  These fourteen (14) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release.  These measures are briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures:\r\n\r\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized Industry and company standards.\r\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.).\r\n-Updated technical drawings, piping & instrument diagrams and process flow diagrams.\r\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained operators.\r\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation.\r\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems.\r\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of process equipment.\r\n-Limited facility access and 24 hr security force.\r\n-Radio communication system.\r\n-Closed circuit television surveillance capabilities.\r\n-Frequent unit surveillance by operators.\r\n-Dikes and curbing to minimize the spread of released material.\r\n-Automatic and remotely operated shut-offs to limit release quantity.\r\n-Strategically located valves to isolate leaks.\r\n-Hydrocarbon and toxic gas detectors at key areas to warn of a chemical release.\r\n-Fire detection systems including flame detectors and heat sensors in fire hazard areas.\r\n-Automated sprinkler systems and fixed"

This rail car had loaded at the facility and was in transit. \r\nApproximately 1/2 gallon of gasoline had been released over time and contained to ballast under the car. No storm water impacts. CHEMTREC Manager and Emergency repair contractor were dispatched to the scene and arrived approximately 11:00 PM EST (8:00 PM \r\nwest coast). Absorbent pads were applied to the ground and the contractor tightened the loose valve. \r\nThe leak was from the top fill valve and cause was \"not tool tight\".

Our program provides the essential planning and training for protecting employees, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The program includes written procedures that outline the actions to be taken for various types of emergencies that could occur in the facility. These emergencies include: airborne releases of chemical substances, spills to the water or ground, fires, explosions, personnel rescue incidents and medical emergencies. The programs address all aspects of emergency response including:\r\n\r\n-Information on the plant emergency organization (Incident Command System).\r\n-Information on the roles and responsibilities of personnel responding to the incident.\r\n-Procedures for notifying employees that a release has occurred.\r\n-Procedures for plant evacuation and accounting of personnel.\r\n-Procedures to notify local emergency response organizations and other appropriate authorities that a release has occurred.\r\n-Guidance on proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures.\r\n-Procedures for post incident cleanup and decontamination.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the plant emergency organization is the Emergency Response Team (ERT). The ERT is made up of full-time emergency response employees, as well as employee volunteers.  The ERT provides the personnel resources for a rapid and effective emergency response.  ERT members train and drill on a monthly basis.  Training and drill sessions include instruction and hands-on practice in the use of fire extinguishers, advanced interior and exterior firefighting techniques, hazardous  material response, confined  space and high angle rescue, NS emergency medical response.
