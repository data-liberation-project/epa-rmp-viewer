THE FACILITY HAS ONE (1) ACTIVE 1-TON CHLORINE CYLINDER AND ONE (1) RESERVE CYLINDER LOCATED IN THE SAME BUILDING ON SITE.  THE BUILDING IS MADE OF CONCRETE BLOCKS WITH STEEL DOORS AND ROOFING AND WOULD BE CONSIDERED A PASSIVE MITIGATION CONTROL.  THERE ARE NO ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS LIMITING THE FILL LEVEL OF THE CHLORINE CYLINDERS.\n\nTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO IS THE FAILURE OF ON E CYLINDER CONTAINING 2,000 LBS OF CHLORINE, 10 MINUTE RELEASE WITHIN A BUILDING, AND RURAL TOPOGRAPHY.  THIS SCENARIO RESULTS IN A 2.2 MILE RADIUS TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT UNDER WORST CASE WEATHER CONDITIONS.  THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO IS A RESULT OF A TRASFER HOSE FAILURE THAT WOULD RELEASE THE CYLINDER CONTENTS OVER A 30 MINUTE PERIOD, WITHIN A BUILDING, AND WITH RURAL TOPOGRAPHY.  THIS RELEASE EVENT WOULD HAVE AN AFFECTED RADIUS OF 0.3 MILES FROM THE FACILITY.\n\nTHE FACILITY PREVENTION PROGRAM IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OSHA PSM RULE AND AN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN IN PLACE.  IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY, THE FACILITY HAS CHOSEN TO CALL THE LINCOLN COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (LCEMA) FOR RESPONSE.  ALL ACCIDENTAL RELEASES WILL BE HANDLED BY THE LCEMA AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES FOR FACILITY EMPLOYEES AND APPLICABLE CONTACT NAMES AND NUMBERS ARE INCLUDED IN THE EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN.\n\nTHE FACILITY HAS NOT HAD A REPORTABLE ACCIDENT WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nTHE FACILITY INTENDS ON IMPROVING SAFETY AT THE SITE BY ADHERING TO THE RMP REGULATIONS AND MAINTAINING MAINTENANCE ON THE CHLORINE SYSTEM AND PROPER TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES."
