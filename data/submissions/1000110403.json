      "SummaryText": "Molson Coors USA LLC operates a brewing and packaging facility in Golden, Colorado. This facility uses chlorine and ammonia.  Use of these chemicals is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR, Part 68). Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, this facility is considered to be a stationary source. \n\nThere are two processes within the Golden Brewery Business Unit that require a Risk Management Program: \n\n1.   Brewery ammonia refrigeration process \n\n2.   Water plant chlorine disinfection process \n\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan, which form the basis of the RM program for the Golden facilities.  EPA's five key regulatory requirements for a RM program are: \n\n1.   Management Plan \n\n2.   Hazard Assessment \n\n3.   Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n4.   Emergency Response \n\n5.   Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements \n\nThis RM plan is summarized below.  \n\nRequirement 1.  Management Plan \n\nThe facility has a program in place to manage the implementation of the RM program elements.  The program is under continuous review and improvement with the objective to reduce release risk.  The program engages operations personnel through the employee participation process. All changes are subject to review prior to approval and implementation following the Management of Change Process. Compliance with program elements is subject to auditing processes.  Corrective actions are implemented to address audit findings. \n\nRequirement 2.  Hazard Assessment \n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius per the EPA guidance. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of"

A wide variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded. \n\nThe RM rule requires the reporting of a 5-year accident history in accordance with 40CFR 68.42.  In the last 5 years, the facility had one of these events, which occurred on December 31, 2020. A mechanical seal on a pump failed, causing the release of liquid ammonia inside the building. The building successfully contained the majority of the spill. Two individuals received medial evaluation for potential inhalation but were not hospitalized. While the building mitigated the liquid release, detailed engineering estimates performed after the event estimated the quantity released as 767 pounds to the air. \n\n \n\nRequirement 3.  Prevention Program \n\nThe prevention programs for the covered processes were developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119). \n\nFor the covered processes (which are subject to the PSM standard), EPA requires a Program 3 prevention program with 12 specific elements as listed below and described in Section 3.0: \n\n1.   Employee Participation \n\n2.   Process Safety Information \n\n3.   Process Hazard Analysis \n\n4.   Operating Procedures \n\n5.   Contractors \n\n6.   Pre-Startup Safety Review \n\n7.

Emergency Response \n\nThe emergency response program is based on the Emergency Action Plan requirement to train all personnel to recognize releases and immediately inform Security by telephone at extension 73333.  Utilities sends trained personnel to the scene to assess the situation. For ammonia, the facility maintains hazmat responders who can take mitigating actions. For chlorine, the facility takes limit"

A joint command is then established which is led by the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) and supported by MC personnel.  The AHJ can call additional external emergency response resources to the scene including City of Golden Fire Department, Fairmont Fire Department, West Metro Fire Department, the Jefferson County Sheriff, Colorado State Patrol, Jefferson/Adams County HAZMAT Team, and other agencies, as needed. \n\nRequirement 5.  RMP Plan and Data Elements \n\nThe specific data elements required to be electronically reported to EPA are included in Section 5.0.  The data elements are supported by this RM plan which documents and provides additional details for each RM regulatory requirement.   \n\nPlanned Improvements \n\nThe facility is committed to continuous improvement to our safety program. The facility invests a great deal into prevention of hazardous material releases each year. The facility implements a Process Safety Management (PSM) / Risk Management Program (RMP) to prevent safety incidents. \n\nSpecifically, the facility is committed to incorporating and addressing recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits, in addition to other safety initiatives to conform with industry best practices. Most recently, the facility has completed installation of improved emergency exit hardware at our Water Treatment Plant, where chlorine is handled. This improvement increases the facility\u0092s ability to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of facility employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of chlorine. \n\nThe facility has also recently completed a project to improve a certain ammonia piping system (\"pump out\") in the packaging area. The piping system improvement decreases the flexible-hose length required to opera"
