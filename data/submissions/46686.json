The CalARP statute is Article 2 of Chapter 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code and those regulations found in Title 19 of the California Code or Regulations (CCR), Chapter 4.5 beginning with 2735.1 through 2785.1.  The local administering agency (AA) oversees the development of the RMP.  The scope of the RMP is based on discussions with the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA), the city of El Segundo Fire Department, to ensure that all issues are resolved and to incorporate state requirements.  The aqueous ammonia process is the only chemical that triggers the RMP/CalARP requirements as previously agreed to by the CUPA.  In the initial RMP submittal it was determined that this process was covered by Program 2 requirements.  El Segundo Generating Station, located in El Segundo, California, is an electric generating station consisting of two operating units, Units 3 and 4 each rated at 335 megawatts (MW).  These units are capable of combusting either fuel oil or natural gas.  SCR technology was installed on Unit 4 in 1994 and in June 2001 on Unit 3 to control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx).  The initial RMP was updated in September of 2001 to incorporate changes related to the addition of the Unit 3 SCR system.\nSCR is a post-combustion flue-gas NOx emission control technology that removes NOx from the flue "

      "SummaryText": "gas downstream from the combustion process.  A reducing agent is used to reduce NOx  primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst.  The most common reducing agent (reagent) used with SCRs is ammonia.  Injection of ammonia into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of NOx emissions upstream of the stack.  In order to minimize the handling of hazardous materials, the El Segundo Generating Station uses ammonia in the form of aqueous ammonia as the reagent for the SCR reactions.  The SCR system in use at the El Segundo Generating Station employs ammonia injection to reduce NOx emissions approximately 80 percent from uncontrolled levels.  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the CalARP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used is 29.4 weight percent ammonia in water, [Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7664-41-7].\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at El Segundo Generating Station is made up of a single underground storage tank, pumps, and piping that terminates at the ammonia vaporization skids where the ammonia is vaporized prior to being introduced into the flue-gas ahead of the SCR.  The underground storage tank is double walled with a capacity of 20,000 gallons.  It is equipped with pressure relief valves, leak detectors, temperature and pressure reference level indicators.  The aqueous ammonia storage tank is filled via a vendor's 6,000 gallon tanker truck with deliveries scheduled at regular intervals based on ammonia consumption.  The aqueous ammonia is pumped through aboveground and belowground 2-inch pipe to the ammonia vaporizer skids for boiler Units 3 and 4.  Other aqueous piping includes a 3/4-inch line to the chemical treatment system.  \nAll other regulated substances on site are in quantities below state and Federal thresholds.

An offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed and considered for the implementation of the accident prevention program and the emergency planning. All activities are conducted in accordance with a detailed, Hazardous Materials and Hazardous Waste Management Plan, standard operating procedures, active participation by management, line and contractor employees.\nThe accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n- Effective preventive maintenance program\n- Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n- Use of accurate and effective operating procedures\n- Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures conducted by those familiar with the operations and maintenance of the El Segundo Generating Station\n- Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\nOther specific steps to prevent accidental ammonia release include the following:\n- The annual training of operators in the safe handling of aqueous ammonia, with emphasis on the hazardous and toxic properties of the chemical\n- The monitoring of tank liquid level alarms, pressure level alarms, pressure/vacuum relief valves, and ammonia gas detectors around the storage area\n\n1.4 Regulated substance handling\nThe primary activity of the El Segundo Generating Station is the generation of electric power.  The only regulated substance used in an amount triggering the CalARP program is aqueous ammonia (29.4 percent by weight in water), which is used as a reagent for the SCR emission control technology retrofitted on U"
