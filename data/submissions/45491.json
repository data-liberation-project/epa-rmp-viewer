This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Calhoun and Charleston Fire Departments which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled    \nOur facility's primary activities encompass Pulp and Paper Manufacturing.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine dioxide and Chlorine Ton Cylinders.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Chlorine dioxide is used as a bleaching agent for pulp.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for drinking water.  \nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine dioxide at our facility is 37,758 lbs., while Chlorine is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 8,000 lbs.  Chlorine dioxide is stored in two tanks in a solution of 10 grams per liter.  Chlorine is stored in 1 ton cylinders.  \n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario    \nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  \n\nWorst Case Scenario - Chlorine Dioxide\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from the Chlorine Dioxide Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 18,775 lb"

All of the tanks liquid is assumed to be immediately released into the dike around the tank, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated overapproximately 88 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L. \n\nWorst Case Scenario - Chlorine\nThe worst cases release scenario involves a catastrophic release of Chlorine from the Filter Plant.  The scenario involves the release of 2,000 lbs. of Chlorine from a 1-ton chlorine cylinder.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of  1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (Chlorine dioxide)\n\nAn alternative release scenario for Chlorine dioxide involves a release from one of the tanks at the Chlorine Dioxide Plant process.  The scenario involves the release of 1,878 lbs. of Chlorine dioxide from the storage tank into the dike and activation of the foam suppression.  The foam suppression system is expected tyo reduce evaporation from the diked area by 90% or more.  At Class D atmospheric stability and 3.3 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance at 0.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0028 mg/L.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (Chlorine)\n\nAn alternative release scenario for chlorine involves the release from one of the 1-ton cylinders at our water treatment plant.  The scenario involves a leak occurring where the portable tank is connected to the chlorine system.  The system is equipped with a chlorine gas detector which would alert the operator who would then be able to shut off the gas flow.  It is assumed that the release lasted for 10 minutes at 1 pound of chlorine per minute.  In this scenario, at Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.1 miles is obtained corre"

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements  of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.       \n\nProcess Safety Information\nBowater Newsprint maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis    \nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of time/period.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Bowater Newsprint maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nBowater Newsprint has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are oper"
