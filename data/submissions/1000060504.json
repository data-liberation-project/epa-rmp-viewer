This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  Our approach is to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances as well as other substances.  If a release does occur, our trained personnel will take steps to control and contain it until local emergency organizations arrive.  Additional details are included in other sections of this plan.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Shute Creek Facility, located about 33 miles Northeast of Kemmerer, Wyoming, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, cryogenic) to produce methane, carbon dioxide, and helium from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  The facility could contain regulated refrigerant propane, and regulated toxics ammonium hydroxide (29%) and hydrogen sulfide in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation.  Transportation of regulated flammables and toxics is handled into the facility via pipeline and trucks and out of the facility via trucks and pipelines.  This facility is surrounded by unoccupied high plains rural area.\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nIn accordance with special security guidance provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), data addressing the facility's Offsite Consequence Analyses (Worst Case Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios) are not detailed in this section.  Refer to Data Element Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this plan.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summa"

This summary addresses each of the EPA RMP elements and describes the management systems in place to implement the accident prevention program for covered processes.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThis facility provides for and encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating/compiling technical information and drawings to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to information related to the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in an Employee Participation Plan that is maintained at the facility and addresses each program element.  In addition, this facility has other initiatives that address process and employee safety topics (e.g., hazard reporting/resolution process and numerous safety meetings [daily, monthly, pre-job], etc.).\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\n\n\nThis facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, safe operating limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The on-site Engineering group is responsible for coordinating the PSI updates.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information (including exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations) is provided in safety data sheets.

In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, the information provides a basis for inspection/maintenance activities and the evaluation of proposed process or facility changes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThis facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nIn the most recent PHA cycle, the facility utilized a Knowledge-Based HAZOP process, a recognized hazard evaluation technique for RMP and PSM-covered processes.  These analyses are conducted using a team of facility operating/maintenance personnel, facility engineers, and technical consultants (as necessary).  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as the accident prevention and mitigation measures.  \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management to coordinate further evaluation and resolution.

Procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.  These procedures provide a consistent basis for training new operators and are annually reviewed and validated.  The Competency Assurance Standard (CAS) provides guidance and electronic tools to ensure the procedures are maintained.

The CAS system guides development and maintenance of written operating and maintenance procedures to provide a comprehensive training program to employees involved in operating and maintaining process equipment.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations (e.g., process overview, applicable procedure reviews, etc.).  New operators are then paired with experienced operators (mentors) to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operators demonstrate (e.g., written tests, hands-on skills demonstration) they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, this facility has procedures in place to help ensure contractors perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in the workplace; understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; understand and follow safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to their working in the facility which includes a process overview; information about safety and health hazards; applicable emergency action plan provisions; and information on safe work practices.  Also, a job safety analysis is reviewed/updated or developed by the contractors (with facility personnel assistance as needed) prior to conducting maintenance/construction tasks.\n\n\n\nFacility personnel routinely monitor contractor job performance to help ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.

The basic aspects of this MI program include: training, written procedures, inspections/tests, correction of identified deficiencies, and quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel receive training on the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures and equipment manuals help ensure work is performed in a consistent and safe manner and provide a basis for training.  \n\n\n\nInspections/tests and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to help ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness, pressure relief device set points).
