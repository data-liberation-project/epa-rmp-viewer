If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the St. Clair Fire Department and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:   Plaze Inc., is a contract aerosol and liquid packaging company.  We use propane to pressurize cans. \n\nThe worsecase and alternative release scenarios:  Our worse-case scenario is failure of one 18,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.   The distance to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.30 miles.  The endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  \nOur alternative release scenario is a break in a 1.5 inch diameter pipe, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint is less than 0.1 miles which extends offsite, and public receptors are within distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the St. Clair Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and the fire department has inspected  this plant.\n\nPlanned changes"
