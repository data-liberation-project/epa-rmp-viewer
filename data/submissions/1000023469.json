LLC - Arapaho Gas Plant\n\nThis summary provides a brief description of the MarkWest Western Oklahoma Gas Co. L.L.C. (MarkWest) Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Arapaho Gas Plant in Custer County, Oklahoma.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMarkWest is committed to the safety of its employees and the public.  MarkWest utilized generally accepted and recognized engineering practices, codes and standards in the design and construction of the Arapaho Plant. Safe work practices have been established and written in a formal Safety & Environmental Policy Manual.  A site specific Emergency Plan has been prepared which is tailored to the facility and the resources available in the community.  Operating manuals and drawings are current for the plant.\nMarkWest has a training program in place for employees assigned to the facility to ensure they can operate the plant safely during normal operations as well as during an emergency situation.\n\n2.    Description of Arapaho Plant and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Arapaho Plant is located 9 miles North of Butler, Oklahoma in Custer County.  Its primary activity is the extraction of natural gas liquids (NGL) from a natural gas stream through the operation of a cryogenic expander unit.  Other processes at the site include compression, dehydration, and product CO2 removal to meet specifications for sales.  The plant has a 7,500 gallon tank that contains a mixture of propane and ethane, which is the regulated flammable substance at the plant.  The plant also extracts NGLs from the gas stream but there is no storage facility for NGL product on site. All NGL product is transported from the plant by pipeline as it is produced.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario \n\nThe largest tank that holds a regulated substance is a 7,500 gallon tank with a propane/ethane mix.  Since the percentage of propane and ethane may vary, for th"

      "SummaryText": "e risk analysis a model run of both all ethane and all propane was produced.  Propane has a slightly higher weight and the off-site consequence analysis was identical for both compounds so it is assumed the entire product is propane for risk analysis perspective. The nearest endpoint receptor is a church approximately two (2) miles away from the plant.  Using this analysis and the attached calculation sheet with the RMP*Comp model it is shown that worst-case endpoint is 0.3 miles; therefore, there is no scenario that could reach an offsite endpoint.  With this information and according to 40 CFR 68.28(b)(ii) there was no alternative scenario considered.  \n\nThe Arapaho Plant is a Program 1 facility.  \n\n\nCalculation of Maximum Quantities\nThe following factors were used to determine the amount of regulated material stored on the site:\n-    Maximum tank capacity of 7,500 gallons of ethane/propane mix\n-    % of mix unknown, assume all propane for worst case scenario.\n-    The tanks are assumed to be at the 100% capacity (normally operates at 50% capacity)\n-    Weight of water = 8.34 lbs/gal\n-    Specific gravity of hydrocarbons:\no    Ethane - 0.572\no    Propane - 0.585\nDetermination of Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Scenarios\nThe 7,500 gallon ethane/propane mix tank was considered the worst-case scenario.  No alternative scenario was selected as in the selection criteria listed in 40 CFR 68.28(b)(ii) states that  the owner/operator shall consider a scenario \"that will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists.\"  No scenario exists that would have offsite consequence.\n\nEthane Calculation\n\nMaximum Possible Ethane = 7500 gal x 100% x 0.572 sg x 8.34 lbs/gal = 35,779 lbs\n\nPropane Calculation\n\nMaximum Possible Propane = 7,500 gal x 100% x .585 sg x 8.34 lbs/gal = 36,660 lbs\n\nTotal Weight of Flammable Mixture\nSince the maximum total propane is more than the maximum total ethane, then it will be assumed that the entire mix is propane to be conservative.\n\n\nRMP*Comp Model Results\n\nRM"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThe Arapaho gas plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases since start-up of operations of the facility in 2000. Due to stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\n5.    Emergency Response Program\n\nMarkWest has an Emergency Response Plan that is site specific to the Arapaho Plant.  The plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to the public and environment in the event of a regulated substance release.  Also included in the Plan is a facility plot plan, chemical inventory, procedures for first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, control and containment of a release, and notification to local emergency response agencies.\n\nEmergency drills are conducted periodically within MarkWest's Western Oklahoma System to provide personnel with experience in responding to simulated emergencies.  Drill scenarios vary so that personnel obtain training on a broad range of possible emergency situations.  These drills are conducted periodically, but at least annually.\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety  \nMarkWest has an ongoing program to monitor the safety of the Arapaho Plant.  A safety hazard reporting program is in place that provides all employees with a mechanism to submit hazards identified.  Reports are reviewed to determine an effective method of resolution and a formal tracking system is in place to follow up to ensure the hazard is resolved in a timely manner.\n\nIn addition to the safety hazard reporting sys"

Deficiencies and recommendations resulting from these inspections are documented and tracked to ensure they are addressed in a timely manner.\nImprovements are also made as a result from programs mentioned above such as incident investigations, and mechanical integrity maintenance checks.\n\n7.      Conclusion\nMarkWest Western Oklahoma, L.L.C. has taken all necessary measures required by EPA and OSHA regulations to ensure the continued safe operations of the MarkWest Arapaho Gas Plant.  This risk management program illustrates MarkWest's commitment to employee, public, and environmental safety.  In the unforeseeable event that a release does occur, MarkWest's emergency action plan combined with the assistance of the Custer LEPC provide assurance that such an event will be successfully and safely mitigated.\n\n"
