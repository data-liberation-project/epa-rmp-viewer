Prior to occupation, it was stated by the previous occupant, that the facility had decreased the charge to below 10,000 pounds and deregistered the process. This submittal has been prepared to reflect the addition of approximately 8,035 pounds of ammonia to the existing system. Based on information that was available and provided by the site, this executive summary has been prepared.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGSC 777 Freeport Pkwy LLC is committed to the safety of its employees and neighbors and operates the Facility as a responsible member of the community. Personnel are encouraged to continually identify methods and procedures to reduce the use of and risks associated with hazardous chemicals. This process includes protecting the community, environment, and Facility personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for the Facility, which are available to all employees.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substance\n\nGSC 777 Freeport Pkwy LLC utilizes anhydrous ammonia within a refrigeration system at the Facility. The facility uses approximately 16,900 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nOff-site Release Scenarios\n\nGSC 777 Freeport Pkwy LLC has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled \"RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines,\" and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. This data were then used to estimate the potential impact caused by a release from each of the regulated substances.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nAs required by regulations, scenarios were considered where the entire capacity of the largest vessel for each regulated chemical at the facility was released in 10 minutes (the m"

Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. Passive mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP, elements of the prevention programs have been developed to manage process safety issues associated with the facility. Each of the program elements has been developed according to OSHA and EPA regulations in order to ensure safe operating practices and conditions at the GSC 777 Freeport Pkwy LLC facility. \n\n\n\nElements of Prevention Program 3 include the following:\n\n- Process Safety Information - information regarding the hazards of anhydrous ammonia, process description, and equipment properties\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis - a detailed review of the process, and recommendations to improve the safety of the systems at the Facility\n\n- Operating Procedures - procedures design"

The Management System includes planning, organizing, implementing, and controlling different aspects of the plan.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the Facility in the last five years (March 2016 - March 2011) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condensers (EC1 and EC2) to the High Pressure Receiver (V-4). The High Pressure Receiver provides priority liquid ammonia to the Compressors for oil cooling. The High Pressure Receiver receives a liquid / vapor mixture from the oil coolers on the compressors.

All of the compressors are equipped with oil coolers and receive priority liquid form the High Pressure Receiver. All of the compressors discharge compressed ammonia vapor (hot gas) to the Condensers (EC-1 and EC-2). A portion of the hot gas is routed to the Underfloor Heat Exchanger for heating glycol. Hot gas is also sent to the following evaporators for coil defrost: AU-1 thru AU-20, AU-23, and AU-25 thru AU-28.\n\nThe Underfloor Heat Exchanger (HX-1) is a shell and tube heat exchanger which is designed to be used in a separate, closed loop system for under floor heating. The Underfloor Heat Exchanger receives hot gas from the Compressors. As the high temperature ammonia vapor passes through the heat exchanger unit, it is partially condensed as the glycol absorbs heat from the ammonia. The resulting liquid/vapor mixture flows to the Medium Temperature Recirculator.\n\nAt the Condensers (EC-1 and EC-2) air (fans) and water (pumps) are used to condense the hot gas from the Compressors into high pressure liquid, which drains to the Thermosyphon Pilot Receiver to begin the refrigeration cycle again. The system is also equipped with an Automatic Purger that removes non-condensables, i.e. air, from the system.\n\nThe ASME vessels and compressor oil separators are equipped with pressure relief valves which are set to actuate at 250 psig.
