Anhydrous ammonia is used by farmer members of our cooperative as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for the production of crops.\n\nAccidental release prevention:\nOur best protection against accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is well-trained and conscientious people.  All workers who handle anhydrous ammonia at our facility are full-time, employees with a number of years of experience.  They receive annual training (either in-house or at regional safety meetings), as well as, on-the-job training.\n\nOur next line of defense against accidental release is good safety equipment and thorough inspection of that equipment.  Safety equipment includes liquid level indicators to help prevent overfilling on all tanks, excess flow valves which shut off if there is a leak in a hose or line, and pressure relief and hydrostatic relief valves which protect from excess pressure buildup.\n\nEmployees are required to wear gloves and goggles at all times when handling anhydrous ammonia. Workers also inspect all trailer nurse tanks for worn or damaged equipment needing repair when they come into the facility and make the necessary repairs before the tanks leave.\n\nWorst case accidental release scenario:\nEPA has requested we model the worst case accidental release scenario in order to determine how many people could potentially be impacted by a catastrophic accident at this facility. To do this we used the modeling program \u00bfRMP Comp' provided by EPA.  We have assumed that the largest vessel at this site had a massive rupture and spilled all of its contents within a ten minute period. This facility has one 30,000 gallon storage tank and three 11,000 gallon storage tanks. However, this site has the capability of receiving product either by truck or by rail. When a rail car is on the siding unloading into our facility, regula"

A location is designated for employees to meet in case of emergency so they can be accounted for.\n- Officer in charge. After the emergency response teams have been notified an officer in charge must be appointed. This will generally be the highest ranking management person present. \n- Media coverage. Coordinators will work with law enforcement to keep spectators at a safe distance. The general manager will be the person in charge of news media coverage.\n- Outside agencies. The general manager has the responsibility of dealing with outside agencies such as OSHA and EPA.\n- Next of kin notification in case of employee injury. This will usually be done by the general manager but he may appoint someone else to do so once we know the extent of injuries and where the person has been taken.\n- Non-employees present. Outside construction workers, inspectors, customers, or visitors will need to be accounted for in an emergency. Anyone who will be on the premises for an extended period of time should be advised of our emergency plan and shown the proper escape routes and head count areas. They also must sign a log indicating time arriving and time leaving the facility.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nWe plan on installing remote emergency shutoff valves on our storage tanks and fill stations in the future.\nWe continue to be dedicated to the safe operation of this facility both for our employees who work here and the public who live and work nearby."

      "SummaryText": "tions consider it a part of the facility. Since a rail car is larger than our largest storage tank, we modeled the accidental release of a rail car of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nA rail car could hold about 160,000 pounds or about 31,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia. If this was released within a 10 minute period, the model shows an endpoint of 4.4 miles. Within that distance about 300 people could be impacted.  This would include residences and a recreational area.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\nFor the alternative release model we used what we consider the most likely release to occur. We assumed the release of 100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a ten minute period. This could occur if a trailer tank was overfilled and a pressure relief valve was activated. The \u00bfRMP Comp' modeling program showed an endpoint of 1/10 of a mile. No people offsite would be impacted within that distance.\n\nAccidental release prevention:\nOur facility is inspected annually by the Kansas Department of Agriculture to insure all equipment is in safe working condition. Our employees regularly inspect the facility and must undergo periodic training on safe handling procedures to prevent accidental releases from occurring. The facility must also meet OSHA and Kansas EPCRA regulations.  In addition, we are required to comply with strict insurace underwriting guidelines and are surveyed annually by a loss control representative.  \n\nFive year accident history:\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility within the past five years.\n\nEmergency response program:\nWe work closely with our local emergency responders, including sponsoring training which utilized a mock accident at one of our locations. Since this is a small community, we personally know most of the fire and police personnel and keep them aware of our operations.\nSteps in case of emergency\n- Our county is on the 911 emergency telephone system and a list of other emergency phone numbers is kept at the facility.\n- Notification of the"
