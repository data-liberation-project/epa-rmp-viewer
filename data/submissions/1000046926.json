This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Laredo Petroleum's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nNatural gas compression of wellhead gas provides gas lift to remove liquids from the wellbore. Gas is gathered from the surrounding wells, sent to the Area 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station for the purpose of compressing the gas.  The high pressure gas is sent back to the wells for the purpose of removing liquids from the wellbore.  Area 8's inlet gas contains enough liquid that liquid extraction is necessary for a portion of the gas so as to use for fuel to power the station compressors and nearby drilling rigs.\n\n\n\nThe process of the compression and dehydration of natural gas and removal of condensate and natural gas liquids occurs in the following way.\n\n\n\nNatural gas from nearby wells is gathered into pipes that extend out into the field in a spider web configuration. The pipes are designed so diameters increase as they grow closer into proximity of the Area 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station and volumes are larger. The gas then enters the SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station.  Oil and water are separated out and sent to 300 bbl produced water and condensate fixed roof atmospheric storage tanks.   The oil is then trucked offsite following custody transfer.  The produced water is sent to a nearby injection well for disposal.  From the separator the gas is measure"

Downstream from the glycol dehydrator, a portion of the gas is split off. The main stream of gas leaving the glycol dehydrator enters the high pressure pipeline where it is re-distributed back to the wells for the purpose of gas lift. A side stream is routed away from the main stream to go through a gas conditioning (refrigerated J-T) unit.   Purpose is to remove the natural gas liquids so as to provide fuel gas suitable for powering the station and nearby drilling rigs.  The processed fuel gas goes to the compressor fuel system and the fuel gas pipeline.  The pressurized liquids are routed to a pressurized natural gas liquid storage tank for storage. The pressurized liquid is then trucked offsite following custody transfer.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68.  The facility contains two sources of regulated substances held over their respective threshold quantities; condensate (pentane) and natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the process at the facility. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nLaredo Petroleum encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating in safety training and E.R.\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nLaredo Petroleum keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  T"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nArea 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station has written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nAll employees involved in operating Area 8 SRH A9-11 Central Lift Station receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Laredo Petroleum has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nLaredo Petroleum will conduct a PSSR for this facility or modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.
