However, if a release should occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nII.    DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Sweeny Unit 44 NGL Fractionator 1 is a fractionation and treating facility to provide a nominal 100,000 BPD of NGL fractionation capacity. The facility consists of amine treating, dehydration, fractionation and product sulfur treating equipment to provide upgrading of Y-grade natural gas liquids to ethane, propane, n-butane, i-butane and C5+ gasoline products.\n\n\n\nThe Sweeny Unit 46.1 Export Propane Unit (EPU) receives HDS Propane containing 3.5-7 LV% ethane and fractionates it to lower its ethane content to less than 2 LV% and produces Deethanized Propane (DEP). The unit also produces ethane with a propane content of less than 3.5 LV%. The units nominal feed capacity is 100,000 BPD.\n\n\n\nThe Deethanized Propane (DEP) product stream from Unit 46.1 EPU is combined with the Frac Propane Product (FPP) stream from Unit 44 NGL Frac 1 and fed into the Unit 46.2 Desulfurization Unit in order to reduce the carbonyl sulfide (COS) content to less than 5 ppmw (as sulfur) and the total sulfur content to less than 30 ppmw and produce Export Grade Propane (EGP). The unit nominal feed capacity is 132,000 BPD.    \n\n\n\nThe Unit 44 Sweeny NGL Fractionator 1 process, Unit 46.1 Export Propane Unit proc"

HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the Risk Management Plan rule is the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment to examine and communicate potential offsite impacts of releases of regulated hazardous substances. Two types of releases are to be considered, a Worst Case Scenario and an Alternate Release Scenario. The WCS (representing a catastrophic event) is defined as a release with the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. The ARS represents a more credible, but still potentially significant, accidental release of a regulated hazardous material. It is also understood that active and passive mitigation systems can be considered in developing the ARS. However, in some cases mitigation measures and systems may not have been included to its fullest extent in order to create potential worst-case alternate release scenarios. In helping to establish the Alternate Release Scenarios that are more credible and likely, certain information such as previous incident history, PHA failure scenarios, siting and spacing studies, etc. were considered.\n\n\n\nNote: For Security purposes, the Offsite Consequence Analysis description and scenarios are not shown in the Executive Summary.\n\n\n\nIV.

Employee Participation\n\n\n\nFacility management supports and encourages employees to participate in all facets of risk management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the facility's Accident Prevention Program. In addition, a number of initiatives that address process safety and employee safety issues are utilized and involve forming problem-solving teams to promote both process safety and employee safety:\n\n\n\n?    Personnel representing operations, maintenance, support, and management work together on the Employee Excellence Team to represent facility employees involving the following areas:\n\n?    Employee Ownership and VPP\n\n?    Pollution Prevention\n\n?    Safety Standards and Procedures\n\n?    Process Safety/PSM\n\n\n\nB. Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Sweeny facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used for the safe and reliable operation of facility processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific teams/groups within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining current and up to date process safety information. Process safety information documents are readily available for review and use (e.g. during unit process hazard analysis, etc.). The facility Management of Change (MOC) process is utilized to maintain process safety information current and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nChemical-spe"

For specific process areas, the complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, and composition) in the unit specific Process Safety Information (PSI). The respective teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and instrumented protective systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, etc.).\n\n\n\nNumerous technical documents are also maintained that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nC. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nA formal PHA process is established to help ensure that potential process-related hazards are identified and controlled. PHAs are conducted to systematically examine covered processes to identify potential process-related hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The HAZard and OPerability (HAZOP) analysis technique is the primary method used to perform these PHA evaluations. Additional PHA tools and methodologies (e.g., Layers of Protection Analysis, What-If, etc.) are utilized based on need and appropriateness for the process under review. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and process engineering experience and expertise.\n\n\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by "

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained in the facility formal corrective action tracking database.\n\n\n\nTo confirm the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Sweeny facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, to include unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process have been developed. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Formal processes and procedures are developed and maintained through the Training Team to help ensure operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified annually as current and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nE. Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, a comprehensive training program is maintained consisting of various job/certification models for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.
