The accidental releasse prevention and emergency response policies at the MidAmerica Industrial Park   Water Plant.\n\nThe Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority (OOWA) which owns and operates the MidAmerica Industrial Park Water Plant recognizes the need for safety in order to stimulate efficiency, improve service, build emplyee morale, and promote better public relations.\n\nThe OOWA interest in the emplyee - to provide proper equipment and woking conditions, and to promote safety and the expectation that the individual emplyee will maintain safe work practices.\n\nThe OOWA is also comitted to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals by emphasizing all aspects of a safe program: i.e., updated operating procedures, a  good maintenance and testing program, and a proper training program which includes instruction in safe operating and maintenance procedures.\n\nFinally the OOWA is comitted to provide its employees the proper training and instruction in responding to emergencies.\n\n2. The MidAmerica Industrial Park and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe MidAmerica Industrial Park Water Plant provides potable water for industries in the MidAmerica Inustrial Park and surrounding communities that are located in Mayes County, Oklahoma.  In addition, potable water is also supplied to Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.  The source of the raw water is the Grand (Neosho) river and the treatment processes include:  prechlorination, flash mixing, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and post-chlorination.  The water plant is currently being upgraded and will have a rated capacity of 50 million gallons per day.  The plant upgrade is scheduled to be completed by September, 1999.\n\nThe regulated chemical under Section 112(r) of the Federal Clean Air Act is chlorine.  The maximum amount of chlorine that will be stored at the water plant is 12,045 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nIn the risk management plan a worst-case rel"

      "SummaryText": "ease scenario was analyzed for chlorine stored in the largest container at the Water Plant which is a one-ton container.  Under this scenario it is assumed that a catastrophic failure had occurred in the container either from corrosion, impact, or through a construction defect.  During this scenario, the contents (2000 pounds) were assumed to be released within a 10 minute period or at a rate of 200 pounds per minute.  In addition it is assumed that there is no effect of containment within a building and no active mitigration (such as an air scrubber) taking place, in other words a worst-case scenario.  Under these conditions (wind speed, 1.5 meters per second; and a class F stability,  a mathematical model has shown that distance to a toxic endpoint (3.0 ppm) would be 3.0 miles.  The residential population that would be affected by a worst-case releasse scenario is estimated to be 2,300.  The public receptors in a 3.0 mile radius of the Water Plant include residences, a public golf course, and a large part of the MidAmerica industrial Park.  There are no environmental receptors that are located within the 3.0 mile radius.\n\nIn addition to the worst-case scenario, an alternative release scenario was also considered.  In all of the scenarios that were considered in Section 68.28 (b)(2),  there were no release scenarios that would reach an end point off the property line of the Water Plant.  The building in which the chlorine is stored would be closed at all times except for the off loading of chlorine cylinders.  In addion if a leak is detected, the system has both an emergency shut-down system and a caustic air scrubbing system.  The caustic air scrubber is designed to remove at least 2000 pounds of chlorine.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program includes proper operation and maintenance of the equipment in the chlorination process,  which includes the sa"

The five-year accident history.\n\nDuring the last five years,  there has been one onsite release of chloine which led to an injury of an employee.  The onsite release was estimated to be less than one pound and in addition,  the amount of chlorine estimated to leave the Water Plant property was insignificant.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response plan has been written and discussed with employees.  Drills will be conducted on a quarterly basis.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe OOWA will continue to update and improve its operational procedures, maintenance plan,  training plan,  and emergency response program."
