Additionally, LSB is a member of the American Chemistry Council and upholds all elements of the Responsible Care Program.\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt LSB, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially those involving hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. LSB maintains an open dialogue with primary emergency responders. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including the following:\n\nA description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Planning (RMP) Regulation,\n\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases,\n\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\n\nAn accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP rule, since the plant was commissioned which indicates there were no incidents,\n\nAn overview of the Emergency Response Program,\n\nThe certifications that EPA requires us to provide, with regard to RMP, and\n\nThe detailed information (called data elements) about our Risk Management Program.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility's primary activity involves the production of nitric acid.  This product is used in the agricultural and specialty chemical manufacturing industries.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals in the threshold quantities that EPA has identified on the RMP Toxic Substances List"

LSB maintains a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  Also, LSB parallels the RMP rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nLSB, Baytown, Texas, maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP and Check Lists.  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LSB maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turn-around.

Refresher training is provided for operator certification.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLSB carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Trained maintenance personnel and our maintenance manager conduct the process maintenance activities.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n \nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at LSB to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process Technicians, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly trained, and are an integrated part of the change order process.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at LSB during the implementation of MOC's.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nLSB conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nLSB promptly investigates an"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nLSB truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.  \n\nContractor Training\nLSB uses contractors to conduct maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes.  A contractor work permit is issued prior to beginning work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.0 FIVE - YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEl Dorado Nitrogen has had no RMP listed chemical releases since plant commissioned in April, 1999.\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nLSB maintains an Emergency Response Plan, which is based on the EPA's Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP), consolidating all of the various Federal and State regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
