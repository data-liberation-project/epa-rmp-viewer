The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety programs include, but are not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The DCC~CDS PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of DCC~CDS to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals have been achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations. \n\nThe Company also recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. The Company has adopted a non-responding facility policy and has established an Emergency Action Plan within its California Hazardous Material Business Plan. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Monterey County Health Department) and the Salinas City Fire Department.  The facility is supported by a partner company, Western Precooling Systems (WPS), which has offices and staff about a mile from the facility.    WPS employs ammonia technicians that are 1910.120(q) Hazardous Material Technician certified.  These technicians would be notified of an emergency at the facility.  The policy is to maintain adequate and appropriate emergency r"

In February of 1999, Dandy Cooling Co., LLC became the owner and tenant. Other commercial neighbors are located on the same site.  The facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables; and subsequent short-term refrigerated storage.  The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest period picking up in the month of April and finishing in November.    Scheduled maintenance is performed in the remaining winter months.    \n\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3).  Refrigeration equipment consists of Pressure Vessels, HydroVac? Vacuum Tubes, Refrigeration Trailers (Compressor Units), Pressure Cooling Equipment, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.  The vacuum tubes are used to pre-cool agricultural product; the refrigerated storage portion of the facility is used for short-term product storage.  Evaporators in the storage section of the facility maintain temperature until product is sold and shipped.  The refrigeration system is configured in a closed-loop system with isolation and overpressure relief valves installed in key areas.\n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and process, and to prevent accidental releases.  DCC~CDS strives to make the PSM Program an integral part of daily Plant operation.  Other safety programs are also integrated with the PSM Program, to the extent practicable and appropriate.\n\nWPS is the company that maintains the"

WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to teardown and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, DCC~CDS and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nSince occupying the facility in 1999, DCC~CDS has made continuous improvements to the facility and ammonia refrigeration equipment.  Improvements include, but are not limited to:  \n?Special self-closing valves were installed as a permissive for oil drain flow\n?Seismic improvements\n?Ammonia/water diffusion system\n?Automatic dialing machine that calls out to Technicians if the refrigeration system approaches out-of tolerance parameters\n?Ammonia sensors and alarms\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Dandy Cooling~Cross Dock Services:\n\n?DCC~CDS has enclosed the facility with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential ?wrong-do-ers?.\n?Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandals etc.  Tr"

DCC~CDS has worked closely with the CUPA in the planning and execution of refrigeration system improvements, and community ammonia awareness and safety days presented at the local community college.\n?Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n\n1.4  Summary of the Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.   There is no qualifying data to report.\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nDCC~CDS does not require its employees to participate in conducting emergency response activities under the HAZWOPER standard (non-responding facility). In the event of an ammonia emergency, the response is to evacuate and to notify the local response agencies.  Employees are trained on hazard communications procedures. \n\nAmmonia release emergency response would be done by the Salinas City Fire Department.  DCC~CDS has coordinated emergency response with the Fire Department including the installation of a Knox Box.  WPS would also be notified in case of a release.  WPS is located about a mile from the facility and employs technicians trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.  The Technician?s role would be to support the Fire Department if an ammonia emergency occurs.  Ammonia emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  WPS maintains written ammonia emergency response procedures.\n\n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n?Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n?Cal/ARP Seismic Assessment;\n?Compliance Audits;\n?Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n?Triennial IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections; and\n?"
