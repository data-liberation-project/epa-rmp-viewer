All employees with operating responsibilities have been trained to the Technician level of Hazmat responder,and to initiate and coordinate the Cayuga Station ERP. Chemical release remediation is coordinated with the Danville Illinois Hazard Material Response Team (HAZMAT) MABUS 40. The station uses the Evergreen system, through implementation by Vermillion County 911, to warn the community as well as travelers in the area of a potential threat associated with a chemical release. The warning through Evergreen goes out as a reverse 911 call to anyone in proximity of Vermillion county. Each year, the station performs a facility-wide ammonia release drill involving the Danville Illinois HAZMAT team and the Local Emergency Management System (EMS), and our in-house Hazmat Team and First Responders."

Maintenance procedures have been developed to exceed basic safety requirements and with the intent of anticipating any and all issues impacting the integrity of the chemical process. Employees and contractors are trained and verified as competent to safely handle, operate, analyze and maintain the chemical process. Employees are trained in emergency action and response procedures coordinating mitigation efforts with outside emergency response teams. The Station has procedures for managing change of the process and incident review. Company policies include oversight including regular internal reviews of practices, programs and equipment in order to verify achievement of company safety polices. In addition, the station conducted a compliance audit by a third-party auditor to verify compliance with industry standards in May of 2018.\r\n\r\nFacility and regulated substances handled: \r\n\r\nCayuga Generating Station is a coal-fired, electric power generating facility located in Vermillion County near Cayuga, Indiana and Danville, Illinois. The power plant combusts pulverized coal in large boilers in order to produce steam which is used in turbines connected to generators to produce electric power. The combustion of fuel creates regulated air pollutants, including nitrogen oxide (NOx) in the flue gas airstream moving from the boilers through the pollution control devices to the chimney where it is released to the atmosphere. The air emission limits are established through federal and state permits. In order to reduce NOx emission, the Station uses anhydrous ammonia in a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process. This process involves injecting ammonia into the boiler flue gas, which then passes through SCR catalyst"

      "SummaryText": "modules. The catalyst in these modules supports a chemical reaction within the ammonia/flue gas mixture in which NOx in the flue gas is reduced and the ammonia and NOx are converted into innocuous nitrogen gas (N2, a major component in ambient air) and water. Liquid phase ammonia to be used in the SCR system is stored under pressure in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks. The Cayuga Generating Station Risk Management Plan addresses the storage and handling of ammonia for this SCR process.\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nCayuga Generating Station has established an Accidental Release Prevention Program for the ammonia system that meets or exceeds the requirements of both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management(PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) standard (40 CFR 68). To ensure safe operation, the ammonia storage and handling system was designed to meet and exceed existing engineering standards and codes. Safety features of the engineering design include emergency, manual, and automatic shutdown systems, flow control valves, local and remote ammonia detection systems, dike enclosure capable of holding the capacity of one vessel plus free-board, and a deluge system designed to knock down and contain ammonia vapor. To prevent overfilling, the Station limits filling of each ammonia storage vessel to 85% of its capacity. The station has a continuously manned control room that monitors the conditions of the ammonia process using ammonia leak detectors, level gauges and sensors. Additionally, the control room has multiple security cameras through which they can visually verify the conditions of the ammonia storage area. Weather monitoring equipment at the Ammonia Tank Farm monitors wind speed and direction in real time.\r\n\r\nThe five-year accident history:\r\nThis is a relatively new anhydrous ammonia process"
