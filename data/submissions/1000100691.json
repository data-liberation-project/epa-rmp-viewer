Facility Policy.\r\n\r\n        The owners, management and employees of WinField United are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Lubbock County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.     Facility Information.\r\n\r\n       The Lubbock facility's primary covered process activity is the storage of fertilizers.  This activity includes processing of anhydrous ammonia by a third-party company called Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and processed into 10-34-0 non-hazardous liquid fertilizer.  Processing is periodic and usually occurs in the Spring and Fall.  Ammonia mixing with phosphoric acid occurs in a T-reactor owned and operated by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC.  Water is used as both a reaction feed material and product stabilizer.  The emergency procedures for Lubbock are coordinated with the Lubbock County LEPC.\r\n\r\n       WinField United - Lubbock, TX  has taken the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The only process that this RMP includes is the storage of anhydrous ammonia. The T-reactor process is done entirely by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC; and their process is also covered by OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.\r\n\r\n3.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and the Texas state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.
