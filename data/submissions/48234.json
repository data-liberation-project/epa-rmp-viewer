      "SummaryText": "Republic Plastics owns and operates a polystyrene foam products manufacturing facility located in San Manuel, Pinal County, Arizona.  The facility, designed to manufacture polystyrene products, involves the use and storage of isobutane and styrene pellets, the pressurization of isobutane gas with pumps located in a high pressure building, extrusion, roll storage, thermoforming and stamping of product, and fluff reclamation.  The equipment associated with the production of foam products consists of two 2-stage extruders, six thermoformers, two pellet feed silos, two fluff surge hoppers, and associated storage and packaging areas.\n\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Republic Plastics facility in San Manuel because the facility handles and stores isobutane, a RMP-regulated flammable gas, in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1. ?112(r)(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  Republic Plastics is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its butane facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  Republic Plastics, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Republic Plastics facility handles and stores isobutane in excess of the threshold specified in ?112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of ?112(r), Republic Plastics management has been aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of a flammable gas.  Programs h"

These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP definition for a ?process?, the facility is defined as the isobutane tank located outside, and associated piping and pumps leading up to the high pressure room and distribution of the isobutane to the extruders.  \n\nRepublic Plastics has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  Republic Plastics has operating, maintenance, and training procedures in place. In addition, Republic Plastics has coordinated with the local fire department.\n\nRepublic Plastics management is committed to the following:\n\n-Preventing accidents;\n-Training their employees in correct procedures in the event of an accident; and\n-Being a good corporate citizen of Pinal County.\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the isobutane process.  Most important, Republic Plastics stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe operation for its employees, its visitors, and its community.\n\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Republic Plastics is in compliance with the OSHA PSM and EPCRA requirements.  Additionally, Republic Plastics has conducted a process hazard analysis (PHA) on the isobutane process and is currently implementing recommendations made to further improve the safe operation of this process.  As a result of the PHA study (conducted using the What-If methodology), in order to avoid an accidental release of isobutane, Republic Plastics is implementing recommendations made during the PHA study.  These recommendations include, but are not limited to, protecting the tank from impact by installing bollards, improved leak monitoring, improving written procedures and training pro"
