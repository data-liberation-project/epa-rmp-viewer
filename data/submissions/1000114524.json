These characteristics provide us with an early warning of the materials presence and force us to retreat from ammonia atmospheres.  High concentrations could have more serious health effects.  These could include convulsive coughing, difficult and painful breathing, eye damage and in extreme cases, death.  Liquid ammonia or ammonia solution contact of the eyes or skin can produce serious chemical burns requiring prompt medical attention.  \nEmployees and contractors who work around ammonia should take the extra precautions of reviewing Safety Data Sheets (SDS's), wearing appropriate safety equipment and participating in special training programs as prescribed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other agencies.\nSafety Improvement Process:\nSafety improvement is a corporate wide philosophy.  Tanner Industries, Inc. continuously searches for ways to improve safety performance.  Each region (North, South and Midwest) has a safety committee comprised of site employees, drivers, sales personnel, and management.  These committees meet on a periodic basis to review safety concerns at our sites as well as at our customer facilities.

The material is transported to our facility by rail car and then transferred from the rail car to our transport cargo tanks for distribution to end-users and secondary-distributors of the material.\nThe potential maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored at this facility on any particular day is approximately 540,000 pounds.  It would be extremely rare for this potential quantity to be on site on any particular day.  Each ammonia tank is limited by federal regulation to approximately 85% of the maximum volume of the vessel.  \nBenefits and Uses of Ammonia:\nAmmonia is a basic chemical that has many common manufacturing and practical uses. Throughout the world, the largest users of ammonia are agricultural industries. Ammonia itself is applied directly by farmers as a fertilizer. Some agricultural businesses combine ammonia with other chemicals and nutrients to form more complex fertilizers. Other common products that are made with ammonia include textiles, pharmaceuticals, cleaning solutions, dyes, inks, and food packaging products. Ammonia is also used by some companies in various processes. Ammonia is increasingly being explored as a potential transportation fuel, especially in the shipping industry for its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime sector. Ammonia is recognized as an ozone safe refrigerant. This means that, unlike other refrigerants, any ammonia releases into the atmosphere will not harm the earth's ozone layer. Besides refrigeration, ammonia is used in some common processes like drinking water purification, air and water pollution control, waste treatment, and the heat treating or hardening of metal parts.\nPotential Health Effects of Ammonia:\nEven in small concentrations, ammonia is irritating to the eyes, throat and breathing passages.
