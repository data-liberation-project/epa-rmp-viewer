The facility complies with the Program 3 requirements of EPA's RMP rule through the implementation of the OSHA PSM Program. The PSM prevention program consists of the following elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf Employee Participation: This program involves the employees, in participation in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program ensures employees have complete access to the program.\r\n\u00bf Process Safety Information (PSI): Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the process. The written information includes SDS's and a description of the design of the anhydrous ammonia containing process.\r\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) methodology have been conducted to look at the process and identify potential hazards.\r\n\u00bf Operating Procedures: Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the anhydrous ammonia process.\r\n\u00bf Employee Training: A training program has been developed which ensures employees are trained on aspects of the process and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the anhydrous ammonia process.\r\n\u00bf Contractor Safety: Contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the anhydrous ammonia process. The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure they follow safe-work practices.\r\n\u00bf Pre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is completed for new anhydrous ammonia project"
