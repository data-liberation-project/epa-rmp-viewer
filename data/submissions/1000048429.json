At the time of the event, wind speeds were 12 mph NE at 55 degrees \r\nFahrenheit. The duration of the release was 8 hours and 15 minutes, beginning at 8:14 am. \r\nOffsite responders were notified of this incident, and responded accordingly. There were no \r\ndeaths or injuries resulting from this release. It was determined that the cause of this was \r\nrelease was human error.

Employee participation in these efforts is accomplished on several levels both formally and informally.  Seven specific procedures and programs \r\nare: \r\n\r\n  * Employee Participation - S&HG (Safety and Health Guideline) #38\r\n  * Krotz Springs Refinery Employee Safety Team (KREST)\r\n  * Safety Field Visits\r\n  * Employee Safety Suggestion Program\r\n  * Process Hazard Analyses (PHA)\r\n  * Job Safety Analyses (JSA) - S&HG #44 \r\n  * Krotz Springs Star Team S&HG #17\r\n\r\nThe Employee Participation S&HG #38 describes how employees are involved in the \r\ndevelopment, implementation and maintenance of each element of the accident \r\nprevention program.

By reviewing hazards associated with anticipatable changes in the process, PHA's are designed to assist in identifying operability problems, safety issues and environmental concerns, and the associated causes, consequences, safeguards and risks.  In addition to performing PHA's that are triggered by changes, PHA's are also performed to revalidate unit PHA's at least every five years. \r\n\r\nThe primary style of PHA used within the Krotz Springs Refinery for both initial and \r\nrevalidation PHAs is the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study technique.  This type\r\nof PHA is accepted by industry as a very thorough and systematic hazard analysis \r\ntechnique. The HAZOP is conducted by a team of Krotz Springs Refinery employees and is lead by an outside consultant.  At a minimum, the Krotz Springs Refinery team always consists of members representing engineering, maintenance and operations. Other employees and contract personnel with specialized expertise may be called in to participate on an as needed basis.  The HAZOP team identifies and evaluates potential hazards and any environmental, safety, and operational concerns which may have a deleterious effect either on site or off"
