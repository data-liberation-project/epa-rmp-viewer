In the case of the Ajax Gas Processing Plant, this would involve our 63,000 gallon flammable natural gas liquids tank (338,100 pounds).  Such a scenario is highly unlikely; however, using the EPAs RMP Comp calculations, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.4 miles (approximately 2,112 feet).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA\u2019s threshold for measurable impacts. \n\nThe alternative release scenario is not required for Program 1 sites.  However, Palo Duro Pipelines has voluntarily presented this case and it involves a shell breach of the propane storage tank.  The release rate from a 4 inch puncture would result in 4,378 pounds per minute.  Using RMP Comp calculations the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 psi would be approximately 0.2 miles (approximately 1,056 feet).  \n\nPalo Duro Pipelines has discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with its employees and with local emergency response officials in Wheeler County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.  \n\nPrevention Program\n\nBelow is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Ajax Gas Processing Plant.
