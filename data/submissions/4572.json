We will accomplish this by using the most current design, training, and inspecting processes available.  \n\nEmergency Response Policy (ERP).   The Town will respond to any emergency in a manner best suited to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment.  Trained on-site responders will access the emergency, and decide on a coarse of action.  For emergencies within their training level they will respond.  For any emergency not included in their training, off-site emergency response agencies will be called.     \n\nThe Stationary Source.  The stationary source is the chlorination/dechlorination system at this municipal waste water treatment plant.  Chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5) and sulfer dioxide (CAS No. 7446-09-5) are the regulated substances handled at this facility.   The chlorine system has a maximum inventory of 16,000 pounds.  The sulfer dioxide system has a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds.  These quantities qualify the system as a Program 3 process.\n\nThe Worst-case Scenario.  The worst-case scenario is the rupture of the largest chemical tank.  The volume of the storage tank would allow a maximum of 2,000 pounds of liquid chemical to be stored.  In the worst case scenario this tank would rupture and spill its entire contents onto the ground in ten minutes.  Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.3 miles.    \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario is the discharge of chemical from a broken valve on a ton cylinder.  Based on a > inch opening, such a release could yield a release of 840 pounds of chlorine during a ten-minute release.  Using the EPA look-up tables for this release, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program.  The accidental"

      "SummaryText": " release prevention program includes a combination of design, training, and inspecting.  The chemical delivery systems were designed according to current codes and specifications, and adhere to good operating practice.  The operators and contractors who work in and around the equipment have been trained in both safety and proper operating procedures.  We have a detailed monitoring and inspection program that maintains the mechanical integrity of the equipment. \n\nFive Year Accident History.   There were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\n \nEmergency Response Program (ERP).  The wastewater treatment plant has a written ERP that includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release.  On-site responders will respond to small accidental releases.  Any large or uncontrolled release will require assistance from off-site responding agencies.  The ERP plan states the specific procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release.  The ERP also includes information on emergency health care for exposure to chlorine and sulfer dioxide.  The ERP was last reviewed on May 5, 1999.  ERP training for all employees was last conducted on May 5, 1999.  The ERP is coordinated with the Manchester Fire Department HAZMAT unit.  The contact is the Battalion Chief, at telephone (860) 643-7373.  The facility is also subject to OSHA 1910.120, OSHA Process Safety Management Rules.    \n\nPlanned Changes to improve Safety.
