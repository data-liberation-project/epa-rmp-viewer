This facility has been operated by The Andersons, Inc. since June of 1999. The Operations Supervisor is Scott VonDielingen, and General Manager is Joe Reed.  Site management names and emergency contact information are posted on a sign at the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe facility occupies approximately 20 acres and is situated at the north end of Agrico Lane, south of M-50.  The facility is bordered to the south by an Indiana Department of Transportation (IDOT) maintenance facility, to the east by an agricultural field, to the north by railroad tracks and to the west by a lumber yard.\r\n\r\nThis facility manufactures a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP-regulated material involved in this fertilizer manufacturing process is anhydrous ammonia.  One 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tank.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is not poisonous, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material, but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas and has a strong chemical affinity for water.  Therefore, an abundant supply of water is"

      "SummaryText": "our best defense against a small or large-scale ammonia release.\r\n\r\nSummary of Major Hazards\r\nThe principal causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves. The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (generally a tanker truck or railcar) to the bulk storage tanks or a transfer from the loading station to the nurse wagons.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses on tank trucks are date-stamped are replaced by the transporter in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\r\n\r\nTransfers from the storage tanks to the processing system or loading stations occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow. \r\n\r\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These events are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.\r\n\r\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tanks were built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code.  The bulk anhydrous ammonia storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders.  \r\n\r\nExplanation of How Hazard Releases are Prevented\r\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices, or technologies that function without human, mechanical or other energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place at the Seymour facility are:\r\n\u00bf  Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\r\n\u00bf  Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point to the storage tanks.

      "SummaryText": "off without disconnecting from the tank, the steel structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place at the Seymour facility are:\r\n\u00bf  Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on the storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\r\n\u00bf  Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tanks.\r\n\u00bf  Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and close when the pressure inside the tank drops below this pressure.\r\n\u00bf  An emergency shutoff which is a pneumatically activated valve and control buttons are located along the unloading station and at the east side of the control room shuts the plumbing off.\r\n\u00bf  An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and an adjacent water well at each unloading point.\r\n\u00bf  Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and"

All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia.  All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files.  Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\r\n\r\nThis facility uses a certified contractor for all certified welding and construction performed on the tank.  The Seymour plant undergoes a complete ammonia inspection by a third party at least every five years.  \r\n\r\nSee Steps Taken to Address Hazards for more information on prevention measures and identification.\r\n\r\nManagement System\r\n(see Steps Taken to Address Hazards)\r\n\r\nEquipment maintenance\r\nAll equipment maintenance is formally documented. See the Prevention Program section for further explanation.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nAll employees receive annual training on anhydrous ammonia, emergency action plan and spill procedures, and hazard communication.  Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\nAll contractors receive a contractor safety review prior to performing work at the facility.  During this review, they are informed of any potential hazards at the facility, emergency procedures, site-specific safety rules and the ability to request an MSDS for any product at any time.\r\n\r\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards\r\nThe Andersons Seymour Wholesale Fertilizer facility has many systems in place for hazard assessment and mitigation.  \r\n\r\nThe Safety Department performs annual hazard management audits at the facility.

Updates on action item status must be made regularly.\r\n\r\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been made at the Seymour facility, as part of their Process Safety Management Program.  The analysis will be updated every five years, or as changes in the process are made. PHA's were performed using the what-if or HAZOP techniques and analyzed all aspects involved in the production of 10-34-0 fertilizer.  The evaluation team included representatives from the corporate Safety Department, group Management and Operations employees.\r\n\r\nEach analyzed situation was discussed, and possible causes were listed.  Unless otherwise noted, situations were evaluated under the assumption that safety controls were in effect.  Potential consequences were listed and given a rating of 1 - 4 for severity and likelihood; with 1 being the worst case and 4 being none or very low.
