As a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and Clean Air Act Amendments 112; Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC completed a risk management plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site above RMP reporting thresholds. Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC include isopentane and pentane  (each exceed 10,000 pound threshold).\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nPacific Ethanol Madera, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol production process.  It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and flammables, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC to notify the Madera Fire Department and the Madera County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Substances Handled\r\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as wet distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 24 percent pentane and approximately 21 percent isopentane, both RMP-regulated substances.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 180,000 pounds (total pentane approximately 42,000 pounds; total isopentane approximately 37,000 pounds).  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as they relate"
