Forms to document and report releases, for release notification, and for threatening phone calls are included in our plan.\n\n\n2.   Facility description and regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility is on property leased from the Port of Whitman by the McGregor Company.  The facility is located on the north bank of the Snake River about 0.80 km (= mile) east of where Highway 127 crosses the Snake River and is in the Port of Whitman.  \n\nThe area in general has fertilizer distribution facilities, grain storage, barge loading facilities, agriculture and recreation facility located about 1 mile down river and upwind.  Barges deliver refrigerated ammonia from Prodica's Rivergate, Oregon and Kennewick, Washington storage terminals to Central Ferry.  These barges carry refrigerated anhydrous ammonia.  The ammonia is off-loaded over a 4 to 15 day period.  If use of ammonia is slow due to weather requirements, the barge may require additional time to discharge.  Barges will be located at the dock during both spring and fall seasons.  Hours of operation are from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. during the spring and fall season.  It is estimated that each season will be 6-10 weeks in duration.\n\nThis facility is designed to receive anhydrous ammonia by river barges.  A marine arm is used to transfer product.

This communication is accomplished by use of telephones and hand held mobile radios.  During ammonia transfer, all operators are equipped with a radio with a spare available in the office for emergency use.  A minimum of two persons will be on duty while ammonia is being transferred: a barge operator and a shore operator.  When ammonia is being transferred to Wilbur-Ellis a minimum of three operators will be on duty.  There will be an operator at each location.  When ammonia is not being transferred a minimum of one operator will be on duty at all times, while the barge is moored.\n\nBarge pumps deliver the -33.330C (-280F) refrigerated ammonia to a booster pump located shore side.  The booster pump delivers the ammonia through a shell and tube heat exchanger which heats the ammonia to 1.670C (350F).  From the heater, ammonia is delivered to the storage tanks, three (3) truck loading stations, a railcar-loading station and to Wilbur-Ellis.  Ammonia delivered to Wilbur-Ellis Company is a mixture of cold and warm ammonia so that the resultant temperature is about -20.560C (-50F).\n\nThe facility provides an office, a truck weigh scale and storage for diesel to refuel the barges as necessary.  Propane is used as fuel for the two (2) hot water heaters needed to warm the refrigerated anhydrous ammonia from -33.330C (-280F) to 1.670C (350F).\n\nThe operation areas are well lighted and safety equipment is provided throughout the facility.\n\nThe facility does"

Therefore, the risk of a release into the Snake River is significantly reduced.  In the event of a spill or discharge into the river, the ammonia would be extremely difficult to recover.  Anhydrous ammonia is highly soluble in water.  Due to this solubility, standard mechanical means of containment would be ineffective, and therefore impractical. \n\nAny large ammonia releases near the bullets will be contained in the depressed area to the west of the storage area.\n\nThe regulated substances at this facility are anhydrous ammonia (refrigerated and pressure) and propane.\n\nThe amount of anhydrous ammonia and propane stored at this facility exceed the threshold quantities established by Federal EPA.  Refrigerated ammonia is stored on the barge and pressurized ammonia in two (2) pressure tanks.  The propane is stored in five (5) pressure storage tanks.\n\n\n3.
