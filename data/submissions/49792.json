              "Description": "PRODUCTION PROCESS\n\nLAYERS OF PROTECTION\n\nPPG has developed numerous layers of protection to reduce the likelihood of accidents and releases.  These layers of protection focus on:  \n- designing for safety, \n- achieving consistent excellent operations and \n- maintaining the facilities.  \n\nEMPLOYEES\nPPG employees are the most important component of these layers.  Employees design, operate and maintain our chemical manufacturing and storage processes.  Employees strive to make continuous improvements to ensure that systems and equipment are working properly.  Skilled maintenance technicians are used to repair the equipment properly and to diagnose potential problems before a breakdown occurs.\n\nCODES AND CONTROLS\nThe prevention program utilized by PPG is implemented by using national codes and standards to design the processes we operate.  PPG also uses state-of-the-art computer controls to give optimum operating capabilities and prevention techniques designed for safety.  Emergency shutdown systems are designed for each process to automatically shut down equipment should an upset occur.  Every process has been reviewed to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and compliance is re-certified on a continual basis.\n\nPROCEDURES AND TRAINING\nPPG maintains excellent operations as another key layer of protection against a release or spill.  These operations include up-to-date operating procedures, continuous operator training and safety reviews on operation changes.  \n\nSAFE WORK PERMITS \nAdditionally, PPG supports effective maintenance as a key layer of protection.  This is achieved by using skilled maintenance personnel to perform all maintenance activities.  As part of the safety preplanning activities for plant maintenance, PPG enforces safe work procedures such as safe work permits, hot work permits, excavation permits, confined space permits, lockout-tagout procedures and roof work permits\n\nPREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE\nAnother proactive maintenance program used by PPG is the preventative maintenance program.  PPG associates manage this program using a computer software program called MAXIMO.  This software program produces maintenance work orders at a predetermined frequency for all process equipment.  Skilled maintenance technicians complete the work order by inspecting and replacing critical equipment as required, therefore preventing a spill or release.  \n\nMONITORING AND DETECTION EQUIPMENT\nPPG has several chlorine, phosgene and carbon monoxide monitors throughout the Optical Materials area.  These monitors provide early warning to operations of a release or spill so that it can be mitigated immediately.  Finally, PPG operators, engineers, supervisors and managers inspect equipment, piping and instruments as part of their operational routine to add another layer of protection to PPG's accident prevention and chemical safety program.\n\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\nPPG people are trained and equipped to respond to emergencies should they occur.  Drills are conducted to test response capabilities, which include use of community emergency responders and the SAFER real-time modeling system.  The drills and annual emergency response procedure reviews are designed to ensure PPG and the communities are prepared to deal with emergencies.",

              "Description": "STORAGE PROCESS\n\nSUMMARY\nThe Storage Process only includes the chlorine and allyl alcohol railcars that are kept on the storage track before being moved to the Optical Products Manufacturing process.  This process was added at the request of the OEPA during their 2002 visit.  Most prevention programs that apply to the manufacturing process also apply to the storage process with some differences outlined below.\n\nPHA\nA node to address the railcar storage has been included in the Chloroformate Distribution PHA.  This node was added in 2011 and will continue to be revalidated as part of the full PHA.  Process safety information for the railcars including railcar design and safe handling is included in the electronic document management system.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThere are no specific operating procedures that address the railcar since PPG personnel do not interact with them while they are in storage.  There are procedures for connecting, disconnecting, and preparing for shipment.  The plant's Emergency Control Manual contains procedures for managing emergencies and releases of chlorine and allyl alcohol which includes these railcars.  The plant's Site Security Manual addresses access to the railcar storage area.\n\nTraining\nTraining that pertains to the railcar storage includes annual Hazmat Training, DOT training, Chlorine C-Kit Training, and drills that have included leaking railcars.  The local railroad switching line has also been provided with information on the chemicals contained in the railcars.\n\nMaintenance\nThe PPG Barberton plant does not service railcars.  The chlorine railcars owned by PPG are maintained by the corporate logistics group.  The railcars are inspected according to DOT regulations.  Allyl alcohol railcars are owned by an outside supplier.  PPG expects these railcars to be maintained in accordance with all DOT regulations as well.\n\n",
