Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Delicato Family Wines Monterey has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to sixty-six (66) jacketed wine tanks.\n\n\n\nEach jacketed wine tanks is equipped with solenoid valves which control the flow of liquid ammonia from the recirculator to the jacketed wine tank. \n\nThe control valve groups are located in next the tanks to which they serve. The refrigeration machinery is contained outside in a designated machinery area. A partial list of system components installed in the machinery area includes:\n\n(1) Screw compressor\n\n(1) Reciprocating compressor\n\n(2) Oil separators\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Liquid Recirculator with two (2) integral ammonia pumps and one (1) oil pot\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into the recirculator. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each jacketed wine tank, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into the tank jacket. Low temperature liquid circulates through the tank jacket. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The "

      "SummaryText": "high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver. \n\n\n\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Delicato Family Wines Monterey consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Delicato Family Wines Monterey is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\nRAGAGEP Statement\n\n\n\nIt is unclear which codes and standards were followed in the original design and construction of the refrigeration system.

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nDelicato Family Wines Monterey has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Delicato Family Wines Monterey facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 16,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient"

Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDelicato Family Wines Monterey has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nDelicato Family Wines Monterey's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\nCal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR ?5189(n)\n\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR ?1910.119(n)\n\nCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 ?2765.1-2765.2\n\nUSEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR ?68.95\n\nCalifornia Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emergency Response Plans and Procedures] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4 ?2731\n\nCalifornia \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 ?5192(q)\n\nFederal \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR ?1910.120(q)\n\n\n\nSelect Delicato Monterey employees receive HAZWOPER, First Responder Operations (FRO) training for\n\nthe purpose of responding defensively to an emergency involving ha"

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Delicato Family Wines Monterey has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Delicato Family Wines Monterey now thinks of the RMP-PS"
