As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Delicato Family Wines Monterey has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Delicato Family Wines Monterey, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Delicato Family Wines Monterey, also known as Delicato Monterey Winery (DMW), has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to sixty-six (66) jacketed wine tanks.\r\n\r\nEach jacketed wine tanks is equipped with solenoid valves which control the flow of liquid ammonia from the recirculator to the jacketed wine tank. \r\nThe control valve groups are located in next the tanks to which they serve. The refrigeration machinery is contained outside in a designated machinery area. A partial list of system components installed in the machinery area includes:\r\n(1) Screw compressor\r\n(1) Reciprocating compressor\r\n(2) Oil separators\r\n(1) High pressure receiver\r\n(1) Liquid Recirculator with two (2) integral ammonia pumps and one (1) oil pot\r\n(1) Evaporative condenser\r\n\r\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into the recirculator. From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each jacketed wine tank, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into the tank jacket. Low temperature liquid circulates through the tank jacket. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The"

As such, the refrigeration system at Delicato Family Wines Monterey is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\nRAGAGEP Statement\r\n\r\nIt is unclear which codes and standards were followed in the original design and construction of the refrigeration system.

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\nDelicato Family Wines Monterey has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Delicato Family Wines Monterey facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 16,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient"

Nevertheless, Delicato Family Wines Monterey \r\ncontinually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Delicato Family Wines Monterey has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Delicato Family Wines Monterey now thinks of the RMP-PS"
