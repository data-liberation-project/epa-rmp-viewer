BAKELITE implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Conway Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Conway Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  BAKELITE provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC and the Conway Volunteer Fire Department.  \n\nTo effectively implement these policies, BAKELITE established a management system headed by the Safety and Health Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\nRegulated Substances:\nThe Conway Plant handles two regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule.  These two materials are Formaldehyde and Aqua Ammonia.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\nThe Conway Plant performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  BAKELITE does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Conway Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite c"

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors' train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.

The resin facility consists of three chemical processes:  a resin manufacturing process that was originally constructed in 1959, a formaldehyde manufacturing process constructed in 1980 and a Spray-dry process constructed in 1995.  Overall, the facility employs 64 full-time employees.\n\nBAKELITE is committed to operating the Conway, North Carolina plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, BAKELITE has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Conway Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Conway Plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Conway Plant.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Conway Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n- A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n- A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n- An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInformation further describing t"

In fact, the Conway Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nBAKELITE limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Conway Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, BAKELITE considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nBAKELITE prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Conway Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nBAKELITE limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  BAKELITE trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, BAKELITE works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the Conway Plant consists of several elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.

The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by BAKELITE.  These requirements are:\n\n-One worst case release scenario in Program 3\n-One alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  The OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince 1993, the Conway Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde manufacturing and storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program.
