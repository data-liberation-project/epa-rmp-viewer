The policy combines advanced technology, standardized operating procedures, personnel training requirements, and a top-down management commitment to safe chlorine handling practices.\nThe Bellvue WTP is located northwest of Fort Collins, Colorado near the mouth of the Cache la Poudre River Canyon.  The plant provides high-quality drinking water to the City of Greeley, Colorado.  An inventory of six one ton chlorine containers is regularly maintained on-site in a dedicated chemical building.  The plant operates 24 hours per day, 365 days a year.  Resident operators address after-hours alarms and monitor overall facility security.\n     The Bellvue WTP Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following elements; Advanced process and safety equipment; A chlorine gas detector alarm that triggers at concentrations greater than one part per million.  This alarm will automatically start the chlorine gas scrubber.  This scrubber is capable of neutrilizing the entire contents of a one ton container.  (The alarm consists of audible horns located throughout the plant and strobe lights on the exterior of the chemical building.  This alarm is also connected to a computerized auto-dialing system that alerts on call personnel.)\n     Standardized operating procedures; Training of operators and maintenance personnel in the chlorine process; Preventive maintenance program for chlorine process equipment; Annual hazard review of chlorine process equipment and procedures; Auditing and inspection program; Investigation program (which will investigate future incidents that could reasonably result in a chlorine release); and Personnel protective equipment, including self-contained breathing apparatus.\n     No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the Bellvue WTP in the past five yea"

The program has been reviewed by  the Larimer County Office of Emergency Management and coordinated with the Poudre Fire Authority.  These procedures will be reviewed on an annnual basis.\n     In the summer of  2002 the Bellvue WTP commisioned a new chemical building.  This building has state-of-the-art safety equipment, including a chlorine scrubber that is designed to safely confine and neutralize the contents of a full one ton container."
