The processed products require refrigeration for processing and storage. Anhydrous ammonia is the primary refrigerant used. There are three ammonia refrigeration systems completely separate from each other. Engine Room #1 is located in the south-central area of the building. This is the original refrigeration system. Engine Room #2 was brought online in 1997 and is located in the northeast corner of the facility building. Engine Room #3 was recently added in 2011 and is located in the northeast corner of the facility.\r\n\r\n4. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios: RMP*Comp was used to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios for the processes. One worst-case for the processes and three alternative case for each process have been considered.\r\n\r\n5. Five Year Accident History: There have been no reportable incidents or accidents during the past five years."
