SUMCO maintains an employee communication system involving training, safety meetings, and a suggestion system.\n \n12 Contractors\nContractors are required to implement OSHA-compliant safety programs. Contractors are advised of hazards specific to their work by the SUMCO project manager. Contractors receive a Contractor Safety Handbook as part of their initial training prior to commencing work.  Contractors are expected to report hazards, unsafe acts, and unsafe conditions immediately.\n \n13 Five-year Accident History\nThere have been no on-site accidental releases over the last five years that resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage.  In addition, there have been no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage over the past five years. \n \n14 Emergency Response Plan\nSUMCO maintains an emergency response plan and an on-site Emergency Response Team (ERT). The emergency response plan includes procedures for responding to small releases of hazardous chemicals. The plan also includes responding to hazardous waste emergencies. ERT members receive refresher training and meet regularly. ERT members, like all employees, are encouraged to make suggestions for improvement and to identify and report hazards.\n \n15 Planned Changes\nAt the current time, no significant changes are planned for the RMP-covered processes.  Such changes are considered as new information becomes available, production processes change or incidents reveal hazardous situations."

Employees involved with process equipment receive the necessary training to ensure the integrity of process vessels, piping, and other containment. Employees are expected to report hazards, conditions, or acts that may compromise the mechanical integrity of processes involving hazardous materials.\n \n7 Management of Change\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Affected employees receive the necessary training to continue to work safely and effectively when processes, materials, equipment, and procedures involving hazardous materials are changed. SDS' are maintained for all hazardous materials used at the facility. Equipment, task, and location-specific training is provided for all employees. Employees are expected to report hazards immediately.\n \n8 Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nBefore a new process or equipment is energized or started up, a PSSR is conducted and reviewed by the EHS Department and others to ensure it is safe to begin operations.  Employee comments associated with the process are welcomed during the review. The results of the PSSR are documented and published.\n \n9 Compliance Audits\nSUMCO conducts internal compliance audits of the RMP program every three years.  Some employees involved in the RMP program participate in these audits.  Specifications, procedures, and training programs may be revised as a result of audit findings. Employees are informed of changes that may impact their work.\n \n10 Incident Investigation\nIncidents involving the RMP-covered processes are investigated and root causes and corrective actions are identified when possible.  SUMCO takes accidents and near-misses seriously. Incident investigations begin as soon as practical after an incident involving a covered process.\n \n11 Employee Participation\nEmployees are e"

The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all standards in effect at the date of construction, 1994. The facility is subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The AHCL and TCS on-site delivery processes are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. The RMP release prevention program is based on the OSHA PSM program. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the facility.\n \n2  Process Safety Information\nSUMCO maintains safety information for all processes. Employees participate in regular safety meetings. The extent and degree of participation vary depending on the level of involvement required of the employee. Employee suggestions and information relating to safety are solicited at these meetings. Employees are consulted for information used in developing operating procedures and specifications. Employees are advised of hazards through routine training and by their supervisors.\n \n3 Process Hazard Analysis\nA process hazard analysis of the AHCL and TCS systems was last conducted by Trinity Consultants on 5/31/2022 using Hazop, What-If, and Facility Siting and Human Factors methodologies.\n \n4 Operating Procedures\nEach significant activity involving a covered process is described in a written procedure or specification. Employees involved in covered processes are consulted regarding the development and revision of operating procedures. Employees are advised of changes in operating procedures through routine training and by their supervisors.\n \n5 Training\nSUMCO provides general and job-specific training to employees.

(SUMCO) is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive, documented inspection, maintenance, and training programs. Written procedures are in place for preventing accidental releases.\n \nSUMCO also has a thorough emergency response plan and a trained emergency response team. Our emergency response procedures have been distributed to medical facilities and responding agencies. The emergency response team undergoes special training and conducts regular drills.\n \nSource and Regulated Substances\nThe facility's primary activity is silicon wafer preparation. There are two regulated substances stored at the facility: anhydrous hydrogen chloride (AHCl) and trichlorosilane (TCS).  The facility has a maximum capacity of 63,000 pounds of AHCl stored and 3,000 pounds in use at any one time.  AHCl is stored in 3000 lb containers on tube trailers with a maximum capacity of 21,000 lbs per trailer.   The facility also has from 10,000 to 15,000 pounds of TCS stored with 1,100 - 6,000 lbs. in use at any one time.  The TCS is stored in 1180 lb containers indoors in a room equipped with a fire suppression system and acid scrubber for room exhaust.    Both chemicals are used in their gaseous form for wafer preparation.\n \nWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, SUMCO used ALOHA software. Modeling parameters were as recommended by EPA in their guidance document for offsite consequence analysis. We evaluated three release scenarios; the artificial worst-case scenario mandated by EPA, and two realistic alternative release scenarios (one each for anhydrous HCL and one each for TCS). Two of these scenarios have off-site consequences.  The scenario modeled for TCS ha"
