This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Polyethylene Foam Extrusion.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl].  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for a foaming agent for polyethylene foam.\n\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenariio.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Tank T-1.  In this scenario 87300 lb. of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.36 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Tank T-1.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cl"

Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.18 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCascades-Plastics maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/13/2001.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Cascades-Plastics maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCascades-Plastics has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employe"

      "SummaryText": "es who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCascades-Plastics carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Cascades-Plastics to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 06/08/2001.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Cascades-Plastics.  The most recent review was performed on 06/08/2001.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCascades-Plastics conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 06/08/01.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCascades-Plastics truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Cascades-Plastics has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nCascades-Plastics has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nCascades-Plastics carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public"

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nWarren County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  \tEmployee participation, equipment manufacturer recommended modifications, employee suggestions, and process hazard analysis are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility.  These changes are continuously implemented."
