At the beginning of each fertilizer season - proper handling procedures are reviewed by all involved personnel.  New gloves and safety goggles are issued.  Two people are present at all times when filling nurse tanks.  Excess flow valves are the chief form of prevention.  Annual safety meetings are held.  Our location is not within town limits and is surrounded by farmland.  Our employee turnover is not high and mutual caring for each other's safety is the norm.\nPolicy Statement: This company believes that it's employees and customers are the most important asset and that their safety and heath are some of its' greatest responsibilities.  Therefore, this Emergency Disaster Plan has been established in compliance with the OSHA Standard, Title 29CFR 1910.38, The Local Fire Dept. and Local Emergency Management.  The training of employees is done by our Safety Coordinator."
