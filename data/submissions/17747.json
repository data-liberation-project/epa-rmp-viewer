At the beginning of each fertilizer season - proper handling procedures are reviewed by all involved personnel.  New gloves and safety goggles are issued.  Two people are present at all times when filling nurse tanks.  Excess flow valves are the chief form of prevention.  Annual safety meetings are held.  Our location is not within town limits and is surrounded by farmland.
