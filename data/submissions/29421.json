It operates to produce a variety of chemical intermediate feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene, and butadiene.  The plant has several regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and butenes.  In addition, the plant uses chlorine and 29% aqueous ammonia, which are regulated substances under RMP.  The entire plant is considered one covered process for purposes of this plan.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \n\nThe hazard assessments were done using the EPA supplied look up tables and equations.   These tables and equations cover all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate worst case (AWCS) scenarios.\n\nThe WCS associated with toxic substances at BOP is a potential release of chlorine from a shipping cylinder that has a potential off-site impact. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences should one occur, EPA allowed no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures to be taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  Chlorine cylinders are stored in two locations approximately 1/4 mile apart.  Since the scenario circles are offset by 1/4 mile and could potentially affect slightly different population groups, two potential worst case scenarios are included in the plan.  The only difference between the two scenarios is the location and number"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant (BOP) has a long-standing commitment to Worker and Public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by its continuing participation in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as well as through the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  In 1993, BOP was awarded the coveted STAR recognition by OSHA for excellence in occupational safety and health.  Continued membership as a STAR site requires continuous improvement in each of 31 rigorous elements, with periodic re-certifications by OSHA.  In 1996, BOP was re-certified as a STAR site and again in 2000.  Another re-certification effort is planned for 2Q04.  Key elements of the VPP program include Hazard Assessment, Employee Participation, Management Commitment and Involvement, Process Safety Management, Incident Analysis and recommendation follow-up to completion.  Our objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  They went on to say, We furth"

This WCS has a potential off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative worst case scenario for chlorine involves a piping failure on a shipping cylinder.  This scenario does factor in the safety measures that we have in place; including chlorine monitors, frequent inspections and detailed operating and maintenance procedures that would minimize the likelihood and magnitude of any potential release.  As a result, this scenario could only impact an industrial right of way.\n\nThe AWCS for 29% aqueous ammonia is based on a loading rack incident.  Tank trucks are staged in a diked area and unloaded into a storage tank for use as an emission reduction agent for combustion sources on site.  The AWCS involves the failure of the 3-inch diameter loading line.  The AWCS assumes the entire diked area would be covered.  The end point calculation was based on evaporation from the entire diked surface area.  Some mitigating factors were considered such as the fact that this is an attended operation and it is expected that in the event of a loading line malfunction, the technician would respond quickly to shutdown loading and to apply water to the surface of the spill.  A sump in the diked area would allow the spilled material to be drained to the wastewater system.  All of these factors would mitigate the offsite impacts of a release.  Even using conservative assumptions, the calculated end point would not reach the boundaries of the facility and have no offsite impact.\n\n   \nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances is a potential vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a sphere containing a flammable mixture.  This WCS scenario replaces the previous WCS, which had a greater potential offsite impact.  BOP proactively worked to remove the previous  tank from operation so that the amount of flammable material held on site would be reduced.  This has resulted in a reduction of potential off-site impact by approximately 30%.  Th"

The WCS assumes that the full tank inventory is released, completely vaporized, and ignited, resulting in a VCE.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should one occur, EPA allowed no credit for mitigation to be taken into account in evaluating this WCS. This WCS has a potential off-site impact.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances involves a leak from a failed piping flange gasket with subsequent explosion. This scenario does factor in some of the safety measures that we have in place; including hydrocarbon monitors, frequent inspections and detailed operating and maintenance procedures that would minimize the likelihood and magnitude of any potential release.   Were this piping failure to occur, alarms in the control center would alert the console operator to the problem immediately.  There are hydrocarbon monitors in the area near the tank and pumps and level alarms to alert the console operator that the tank level was falling unexpectedly.  In addition, the contents of this tank are used by an adjacent ExxonMobil facility as a feedstock for their operations.  They would also notify BOP immediately if their operations were upset by a sudden end to their feed supply.  Based on these mitigating factors, it is expected that a piping failure would be discovered and eliminated within 10 minutes.  This would therefore result in no offsite consequences.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has identified Safe Operating Windows (SOW); i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated (called a Process Hazard Analysis, or PHA, team).  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results, as well as tracks changes through the management of change system (discussed below).

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the chemical plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) \n\nThe purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

These practices, along with related procedures and training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change \n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, process operating conditions, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation \n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant man"

The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits  \n\nTo help ensure that the OSHA PSM program is functioning properly, the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the program are being implemented.  ExxonMobil personnel from other sites who are considered experts in the safety and environmental fields conduct compliance audits at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to chemical plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nIn addition, an annual assessment of our management systems is conducted by BOP personnel to ensure they are functioning as intended.  Work plans are developed and tracked for systems where the assessment team has identified improvement opportunities.\n\nThis system will be modified as necessary to incorporate the elements necessary to ensure compliance with the Risk Management Plan Prevention Program prior to the next audit cycle.  The data submitted in the plan is the data from the most recent audit driven by OSHA PSM.  \n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \n\nThe processes at the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant has safety features on many units to help, (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n2. Operator surveillance \n\nRelease Containment/Control\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate releases\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n3. Alarms that give early indication of approaching operating limits and provide opportunity for operator intervention\n4. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n5. Curbing,  dikes, or water sumps to contain liquid releases\n6. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., un-interruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n\nRelease Mitigation\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n2. Deluge system for specific equipment\n3. Trained emergency response personnel\n4. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n5. Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the life of the plant.  There were two accidents in the past 5 years that qualify as RMP reportable.  \n\nThe first event, in July 2000, was caused by a site-wide power failure that caused a major plant upset.  This upset caused a failure of the tubes inside one of the cracking furnaces that resulted in a fire and damage to the furnace.  N"

The filter system was inadvertently opened under pressure, creating a flash fire that resulted in the death of an employee.  No offsite impacts occurred as a result of this incident.  This incident is still under investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive annual training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant also maintains a volunteer fire brigade comprised of plant employees for the purpose of prevention, controlling/containing and suppressing industrial fires or chemicals releases.
