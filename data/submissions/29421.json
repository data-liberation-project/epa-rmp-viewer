This commitment is demonstrated by its continuing participation in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as well as through the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  In 1993, BOP was awarded the coveted \"STAR\" recognition by OSHA for excellence in occupational safety and health.  Continued membership as a STAR site requires continuous improvement in each of 31 rigorous elements, with periodic re-certifications by OSHA.  In 1996, BOP was re-certified as a STAR site and again in 2000.  Another re-certification effort is planned for 2Q04.  Key elements of the VPP program include Hazard Assessment, Employee Participation, Management Commitment and Involvement, Process Safety Management, Incident Analysis and recommendation follow-up to completion.  Our objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We furth"

It operates to produce a variety of chemical intermediate feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene, and butadiene.  The plant has several regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and butenes.  In addition, the plant uses chlorine and 29% aqueous ammonia, which are regulated substances under RMP.  The entire plant is considered one covered process for purposes of this plan.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \n\nThe hazard assessments were done using the EPA supplied \"look up tables\" and equations.   These tables and equations cover all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate worst case (AWCS) scenarios.\n\nThe WCS associated with toxic substances at BOP is a potential release of chlorine from a shipping cylinder that has a potential off-site impact. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences should one occur, EPA allowed no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures to be taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  Chlorine cylinders are stored in two locations approximately 1/4 mile apart.  Since the scenario circles are offset by 1/4 mile and could potentially affect slightly different population groups, two potential worst case scenarios are included in the plan.  The only difference between the two scenarios is the location and number "

This scenario does factor in the safety measures that we have in place; including chlorine monitors, frequent inspections and detailed operating and maintenance procedures that would minimize the likelihood and magnitude of any potential release.  As a result, this scenario could only impact an industrial right of way.\n\nThe AWCS for 29% aqueous ammonia is based on a loading rack incident.  Tank trucks are staged in a diked area and unloaded into a storage tank for use as an emission reduction agent for combustion sources on site.  The AWCS involves the failure of the 3-inch diameter loading line.  The AWCS assumes the entire diked area would be covered.  The end point calculation was based on evaporation from the entire diked surface area.  Some mitigating factors were considered such as the fact that this is an attended operation and it is expected that in the event of a loading line malfunction, the technician would respond quickly to shutdown loading and to apply water to the surface of the spill.  A sump in the diked area would allow the spilled material to be drained to the wastewater system.  All of these factors would mitigate the offsite impacts of a release.  Even using conservative assumptions, the calculated end point would not reach the boundaries of the facility and have no offsite impact.\n\n   \nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances is a potential vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a sphere containing a flammable mixture.  This WCS scenario replaces the previous WCS, which had a greater potential offsite impact.  BOP proactively worked to remove the previous  tank from operation so that the amount of flammable material held on site would be reduced.  This has resulted in a reduction of potential off-site impact by approximately 30%.  Th"

The WCS assumes that the full tank inventory is released, completely vaporized, and ignited, resulting in a VCE.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should one occur, EPA allowed no credit for mitigation to be taken into account in evaluating this WCS. This WCS has a potential off-site impact.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances involves a leak from a failed piping flange gasket with subsequent explosion. This scenario does factor in some of the safety measures that we have in place; including hydrocarbon monitors, frequent inspections and detailed operating and maintenance procedures that would minimize the likelihood and magnitude of any potential release.   Were this piping failure to occur, alarms in the control center would alert the console operator to the problem immediately.  There are hydrocarbon monitors in the area near the tank and pumps and level alarms to alert the console operator that the tank level was falling unexpectedly.  In addition, the contents of this tank are used by an adjacent ExxonMobil facility as a feedstock for their operations.  They would also notify BOP immediately if their operations were upset by a sudden end to their feed supply.  Based on these mitigating factors, it is expected that a piping failure would be discovered and eliminated within 10 minutes.  This would therefore result in no offsite consequences.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant.

Further, as already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this Risk Management Plan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  To minimize rework, we selected May 1, 1999, as the date to begin collecting this information.  Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, a key thrust of the OSHA VPP program.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, a number of initiatives are under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personnel safety.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated (called a Process Hazard Analysis, or PHA, team).  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.

Following are several that are representative of the types of changes made:\n\n- Decommissioned ZTK-02, BOP's previous flammable WCS, resulting in a decrease of approximately 11 million pounds of flammable inventory and ~30% reduction in potential offsite impact.\n- Routed the vents from the chlorine safety valves into the cooling tower to minimize release to atmosphere in the event of overpressure.\n- Installed stainless steel jacket on spheres storing flammable liquids to serve as insulation from fire.\n- Installed facilities to allow for de-watering of sphere to minimize risk of peroxide formation and explosion potential.\n- Installed high level alarms to help prevent overfilling of knockout drum / pot and subseq"

As such, we participated in the East Harris County Manufacturer's Association community rollout of the release scenario information contained in this plan.  The information, provided in both English and Spanish, included general descriptions of the RMP regulation, scenario circles, and Shelter-in-Place information, as well as facility specific Worst Case and Alternative Case Scenarios, mitigation techniques and 5-year accident histories.\n\nRMP briefings were held for the trustees of the local school district and community college, LEPC, city council and business/service organizations and over 50 local professional, neighborhood, civic, and church organizations.  The changes that are being made in this plan are being communicated to the LEPC.\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant is also a member of the Plant Managers' Network which sponsors the Baytown Area Citizens Advisory Panel.  This panel is comprised of a cross section of individuals from the Baytown and Mont Belvieu communities and meets monthly with representatives of the Plant Managers' Network.  Topics of discussion include safety, emergency response, plant operations and RMP communications. \n\nMembers of the local community interested in receiving additional information regarding the ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant's Risk Management Plan or Emergency Response Plan should contact the ExxonMobil Baytown Area Public Affairs Manager."
