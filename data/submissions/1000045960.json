Wastewater is processed and treated with gaseous Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide, each of which is feed into the system from one ton containers.\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored as a liquid under pressure in the containers, and is supplied to the treatment system as a gas under vacuum.  Four one ton containers located outside under shade cover are connected to the Chlorine feed system.  Chlorine is fed from two containers at a time.  Feed is automatically switched to the second set of containers when the first set is empty.  Up to two additional containers are stored in the covered container storage area.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide is also stored under pressure as a liquefied gas in one ton containers and is supplied to the treatment system as a gas under vacuum.\n\n\n\nTwo Sulfur Dioxide containers, located outdoors in and enclosed sheet metal storage box, are connected to the feed system.  Gas is fed to the treatment system from one container at a time.  Feed is automatically switched to the remaining container when the first is empty.  Up to two additional full sulfur dioxide containers are stored in covered container storage area.\n\n\n\nChlorine and Sulfur Dioxide are delivered by truck in one ton containers from a regional supplier.  The plant operators use the facility's hoists to remove the containers from the delivery truck and place them on storage racks in each chemical storage area.\n\n\n\nAs a measure to protect against the occurrence of accidental chemical releases, periodic reviews are conducted to identify potential hazards associated with the equipment and procedures for the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide system.  Any identified deficiencies, such as potential equipment malfunctions or human errors, must be documented and maintained.  Sets of standard operating procedures (SOP) are in place for proper storage, use, and handling of Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide"
