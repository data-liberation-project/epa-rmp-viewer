In addition, DSHE-FESD is a member of the local community response network with mutual aid agreements in place to assist or be assisted by other fire departments, including the Harford County Hazardous Material Emergency Response Unit.  Emergency response personnel participate in addressing major regulations (such as the RMP) with other directorates/divisions that require emergency service planning.  Policy for the DSHE-FESD is defined by Army Regulation (AR) 420-90 which adopts the National Fire Protection Association codes for operation.\n\nPlanned changes:\n\nOver the past several years, a number of accidental release prevention steps have been taken to improve the safety and reliability of the chlorine systems.  The chlorine distribution systems were converted to vacuum systems with controls that will stop the flow of chlorine in the event of a pipe break or similar equipment failure.  Additionally, the amount of on-site chlorine was reduced substantially.  A variety of physical security measures are in place at all facilities, to include patrols by armed security forces to prevent unauthorized access.  APG is committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the RMP, and no significant changes to the system are currently planned. The ammonia refrigeration system at the climatic firing facility is a new installation constructed and installed to the latest engineering design and safety standards. A"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThis updated RMP covers the storage and use of chlorine at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) water treatment plant (WTP) and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia as an  refrigerant at the Climatic Firing Facility (CFF); and the temporary storage and transfer of phosgene for research and development (R&D) testing..\n\nFacility Background:\n\nThe APG located approximately 30 miles north of Baltimore, Maryland and 50 miles south of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It occupies more than 72,500 acres in Harford County, Maryland.  44,000 of those acres are either wetlands, or under water, including portions of the Bush and Gunpowder River and the Chesapeake Bay.  The APG comprises two areas, the Aberdeen Proving Ground Aberdeen Area (APG-AA) and the Aberdeen Proving Ground Edgewood Area (APG-EA), which are 15 miles apart by land.  The APG is home to more than fifty tenants and numerous satellite activities.  Among the major tenants are the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC); U.S. Army Ordnance Center and School (OC&S); U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC); U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command (RDECOM) which includes the U.S. Army Research Laboratory; U.S. Army Environmental Center (AEC); U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM); and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (MRICD).\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe APG is committed to being a safe neighbor and employer.  Prevention of accidents, employee safety and emergency response are all operations which have command support and visibility.  The APG follows applicable regulations, requirements and policies designed to provide a safe work environment.  \n\nRegulated substances\n\nChlorine and anhydrous ammonia are currently the only chemicals for which APG is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program.  Chlorine is used and stored at APG's WTP and WWTP, and is presen"

APG's PSM Plan addresses safety in the workplace by identifying related work processes and assuring all safety measures required are followed.   The ICP describes additional procedures and regulations followed by various APG offices in preparation for response to a hazardous materials incident.  The ICP is included in this document by reference.
