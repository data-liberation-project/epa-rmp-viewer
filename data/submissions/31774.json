The anhydrous ammonia is used as raw material to produce nitric acid. The nitric acid is in turn used to produce granular ammonium nitrate. The Homestead Plant also dispenses anhydrous ammonia to tank cars and tank trucks for fertilizer application via ammonia transfer pumps.\n\n\nRATIONALE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND \nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nThe 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of substances into the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. As a result of the 1990 Amendments, EPA issued the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) that requires affected facilities to develop and implement a risk management program. The affected facilities include any facilities that handle, manufacture, store, or use above the specified threshold quantities of toxic substances in a process, including ammonia. The threshold quantity for ammonia to trigger the development and implementation of a risk management program is 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe risk management program is designed to prevent accidental releases of substances that could cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. Since Agrium is handling more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia, it has developed and implemented a risk management program. Agrium's risk management program includes an offsite consequence analysis of a potential accidental release, a five year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\n\nFIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HSTORY\n\nThe five-year accident history involves an"

The five-year accident history covers:\n-The release of ammonia from Agrium's facility.\n-A release that causes at least one of the following:\nDeaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or\nknown offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage,\nor environmental damage.\n                                  \n\nDuring the last five years, Agrium has had four reportable anhydrous ammonia releases. None of the releases caused death, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or off-site deaths, known injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. All of the releases were reported to the local emergency planning committee, Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, and EPA.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAgrium has a Release Prevention Program (RPP) in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at the facility .The RPP includes:\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nAgrium has developed and is keeping current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining to the hazards of the process, the technology of the process, and equipment of the process. All employees are trained in the area where they will perform work and all contractors are given training before entry into the plant is allowed. The PSI will enable the employees and contractors of Agrium to identify and understand the hazards posed by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nAgrium is committed to performing PHA to identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with Agrium's processes. The PHA is used to analyze potential mishaps, identify the mishaps that could occur, analyze the likelihood that mishaps will occur, evaluate the consequence of these mishaps, and analyze the likelihood that safety systems, mitigatio"

The OPs address:\n-all operating modes (startup, shutdown, etc.)\n-operating limits, consequences of deviations, safeguards\n-health and safety \n-safety systems and functions\nThe OPs are updated and certified annually to be current and accurate.\n\nTraining\nAgrium is committed to provide its employee's comprehensive training to assure that the work force can perform their duties safely, efficiently, and effectively. Employees assigned to a process area are trained in all steps of operating phases including startup, shutdown, normal operations, emergency operations, operating limits, and safety systems and functions. Employees are provided refresher training at least every three years, and more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI)\nAgrium has developed a written program of maintaining the MI of process equipment at the Agrium facility. The MI program includes inspection and testing of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAgrium has communicated to all of its employees that it is every employee's responsibility to report incidents and near misses. After an incident is reported, an incident investigation is conducted. Findings and recommendations are promptly addressed and resolutions documented. The leader of the incident investigation team is knowledgeable of the plant and trained at the Process Safety Institute in incident investigation. \n\nCompliance Audit\nA compliance audit of the Agrium facility will be conducted at least every three (3) years to evaluate compliance of Agrium's process with t"

Agrium's MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place.\n-authorization requirement for the change.\n-technical basis for the proposed change.\n-impact of the change on health and safety.\n\nAfter changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the affected employees prior to startup of the modified process. In addition, the PSI and OP will be updated to reflect the changes made.\n\nPre-Startup Review (PSR)\nWhen change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, Agrium will conduct a PSR. The PSR Team Leader will develop a checklist and assemble a team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSR. All PSR members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained in the area of change.\n\nContractors\nAgrium has developed and implemented safe work practices to control the entrance, presence and exit of contract employees in covered process areas. It is Agrium's policy to select safe contractors, provide appropriate safety related information to contractors, develop safe work practices related to contractors and periodically evaluate contractors.\n\nAgrium will inform contractors of the known potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards related to the contractors work and the process.

A permit is required when hot work is to be conducted on or near Agrium's process. This permit ensures that fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to hot work operations.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAgrium has an Emergency Response Program (ERP) in place to respond to releases of hazardous material at this facility. All Agrium employees, who meet the physical requirements, are part of the emergency response team and have received 40 hours training at the Hazardous Materials Technician level and continue to receive 24-hour update training classes annually. They are trained in emergency response procedures, first aid and CPR. They will be responsible for responding to all releases and performing first aid duties at the immediate scene of a release.\n\nAgrium is working closely with the LEPC and Rural Fire Department in responding to emergencies. The Rural Fire Department tours the Agrium facility at least once a year to determine what hazardous materials are present, the location of the materials, and the best responding procedures. Agrium also keeps the LEPC and Rural Fire Department informed of any new hazardous materials that are introduced into the workplace.
