This process includes chlorine gas injectors for wastewater, storage of two 1-ton cylinders of chlorine for wastewater treatment, and storage of chlorine cylinders for water treatment.  The prevention program for the Chlorine system consists of a written Risk Management Plan that addresses each of the elements required by OSHA's PSM and EPA's RMP programs.  The plan includes procedures for employee participation, training, process safety information, process hazard analysis, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, operating procedures, hot work permits, contractor safety, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.  There are no trade secrets associated with the chlorination process.",

The plant is permitted for a monthly average flow of 2.0 million gallons per day.  The facility uses oxidation ditch activated sludge process to treat the incoming wastewater flow.  The treated, clear effluent water is disinfected using chlorine prior to discharge.\n\nThe plant handles one regulated substance in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency's threshold limit for accidental release prevention.  The facility receives and stores chlorine in one ton cylinders.  The maximum number of cylinders on site is two.  Chlorine gas is greenish yellow in color and liquid chlorine has a clear amber color.  Chlorine gas is approximately 2 = times heavier than air and liquid chlorine is approximately 1 = times heavier than water.  Chlorine in non-explosive and it's odor is easily detectable at very low concentrations.\n\nTo help in the prevention of accidental releases of chlorine, the Garden City Water Pollution Control Plant's safety program includes maintaining the equipment to insure proper operation by qualified personnel who receive on the job training in chlorine handling safety.\n\nIn the past five years, the Garden City Water Pollution Control Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine.\n\nThe Garden City Water Pollution Control Plant emergency response program consists of personnel trained to respond quickly and safely to emergencies.  The plant personnel are instructed to notify the Garden City Fire Department of any emergencies."
