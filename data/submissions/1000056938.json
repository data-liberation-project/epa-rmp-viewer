      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Paul, ID Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are applicable to two of the three covered processes operated at this Facility.  OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111 are also applicable and are included in the Combined Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program (PSM/RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of aqua ammonia from the Paul, ID Facility located at 401 East Railroad Avenue, Paul, ID 83347.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Paul, ID Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Paul, ID Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as a First Time Submission.  This Paul, ID Facility is in the process of modifying its existing operations.  As part of these modifications, The Paul, ID Facility will be storing aqua ammonia above the regulatory threshold quantities and will be using this covered substance to blend other Fertilizer products.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 and 3 PSM/RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Report and the Facility PSM/RMPr Program Document.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Paul, ID Facility is a retail and fertilizer blending agricultural chemical facility that operates two (2) covered processes including: Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia); and Covered Process 2: Fertilizer Blending (Aqua Ammonia).

The commercial tanker truck operators (Vendor/Contractor) delivering the aqua ammonia will perform the transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena will store the aqua ammonia in aboveground stationary storage tanks.  From the storage tanks, the Facility will transfer aqua ammonia to the Fertilizer Blender.  At the Fertilizer Blending process, the aqua ammonia will be blended with water, phosphoric acid and other micronutrients to make other Fertilizer Products.  All transfer and blending operations will be performed in accordance with the covered process-specific operating procedure as provided in the PSM/RMPr Program Document.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nTwo worst case offsite consequence analyses (OCA) representing the regulated substance and the two (2) covered processes were completed for this Facility.  The worst case scenario for aqua ammonia assumes that all the contents in a 30,000 gallon stationary storage tank is released into the containment instantaneously.  The aqua ammonia was modeled as liquid spill and evaporation from the secondary containment system.  \n\n\n\nTwo alternative scenarios representing the regulated substance and the two (2) covered processes were completed for this Facility.  The alternative case scenario for aqua ammonia assumes to take the form of a failure of a 4\" transfer hose during the load in (i.e. from commercial tanker truck) or load out (i.e. to the Fertilizer Blending) operation.  For this scenario, the release is assumed to occur in the Fertilizer Blending process containment area and is controlled by manually closing a control valve. The aqua ammonia was modeled as liquid spill and evaporation from the Fertilizer Blending secondary containment system. \n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Terminal Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.

The Terminal Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Permit, Contractors and Emergency Response.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Paul, ID Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Paul, ID  Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Paul, ID Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Paul, ID Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Minidoka County LEPC and the Paul City Fire Department.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Paul, ID Facility.\n\n"
