This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Celanese Meredosia facility manufactures various adhesives and polymer resin.  The site began operations in 1955 and currently employs about 50 people. The facility is comprised of several batch process systems that manufacture solvent based adhesives. Our products are used in various industries. The following chemicals are included in our risk management plan:\r\n\r\nVinyl Acetate\r\nEthylene\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program & the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accident release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA guidelines. The following section briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nComprehensive studies are conducted to ensure that hazards associated with site processes are identified and controlled effectively.  The methodologies used to complete these studies are often HAZOP and Fault tree analysis, as appropriate for the situation.  A team performs the process hazard analysis (PHA) and includes expertise in engineering and operations.  All PHA's are updated and revalidated by a competent team (as described above) and all action items/recommendations are tracked for resolution in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWritten operating procedures are maintained for the pu"

These procedures address various modes of operation, including normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  A system exists so that all the required operating procedures stay current and accurate.  The procedures are readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nA comprehensive operations training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent and familiar with the operating procedures associated with the processes.  A system is in place so that all required training is conducted in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nA written policy exists to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and provided training to deal with the modification. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Reviews\r\n\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modificalions of established processes are conducted.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audit\r\n\r\nAudits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM and RMP rules are being complied with.  These audits occur at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nWe investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulaled substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a mininum of 5"

Company employees routinely participate in process hazard analyses, operating procedures updates, department inspections, incident investigations, safe work permit procedure updates, emergency drills, etc.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nOn occasion, contractors are hired to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selection of a contractor, an evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor company is completed.  Contractors are trained on the known potential hazards related to the contractors' work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\t\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nVinyl Acetate Storage Tank\r\n\r\nThe vinyl acetate storage tank has been constructed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  Mechanical integrity inspections of the tanks is conducted.  The tank has secondary containment and hydrant-mounted firewater monitors to minimize tha impact in case of a release. \r\n\r\nEthylene Storage Tank\r\n\r\nThe ethylene storage system was built in 1997 as per applicable engineering standard.  Access to the tank is restricted.  It was pressure-tested prior to placing in service and mechanical integrity inspections are conducted.  All electrical accessories, such as pumps, instruments, and wiring, are explosion-proof and constructed per applicable electrical codes.  It has a state-of-the-art redundant pressure relief system and is monitored 24 hours per day by a remotely monitored video camera.  Product unloading is generally conducted during daylight housr.

Emergency Response Plan\r\n\r\nWe have a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning for potential chemical accidents, we communicate and work closely with local emergency planning committee and other community responders, such as fire department, ambulance crews, etc. These responders and our employees perform emergency drills together periodically. The emergency plan is updated promptly to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nCelanese is continually working to improve safety.  Examples of planned changes include adding an audible alarm outside of the VAE building, adding a safeguard to alert operators when the VAE ventilation system fails, and improving the reliability of the VAE reactor emergency release interlock"
