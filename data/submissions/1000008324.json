The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid product from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquid are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for offsite sales.\n\nThe Benedum Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Benedum Gas Plant is located near Rankin, Texas and operates a variety of processes to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas\n2. Condensate\n3. Residue gas\n\nOFFISTE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at Bendum Gas Plant is a vapor cloud explosion involving 856,000 pounds (150,000 gallons) of a flammable mixture contained in a Pressurized Condensate Tank. Using the EPA OCA Guidance Equations, the entire inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion that reaches the 1 psi overpressure at 0.76 miles. Since the facility is located in an unpopulated area, the WCS will not affect offsite endpoints or public receptors. A consideration of the 0.76 mile radius has been"
