              "Description": "The Conway Water Treatment Plant is a municipal facility owned by the City of Conway, and operated by Conway Corporation.  This facility falls under the NAICS Code 22131.  Our safety information was last reviewed and updated April 14, 1999 (safety meetings are also conducted monthly).  We are subject to the handling codes of the National Fire Protection Association for compressed gas cylinder storage, American National Standards Institute, and American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  These standardsalong with applicable (though not requried) OSHA Standardshave been implemented through written manuals.  Even though this is a municipal facility, and is not governed by OSHA, Tucker Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant has decided to use Process Safety Management as the prevention program.  To Prevent/limit releases, this facility operates the chlorine system on an automatic vacuum feed system, manual shutoff valves, and pressure regulators.  The vacuum feed regulators are cylinder mounted, therrefore the system will shut off the chlorine feed from the cylinders if threre is a line leak anywhere from the chorine tank valve on to the injectors.  Employees at the wastewater treatment plant conduct maintenance checks on all systems involved with the chlorine on a daily basis.  These checks involve reading pressure guages, inspecting cylinders, feed lines, etc.  Employees practice safe handling practices, and follow manufacturer's recommendations on cylinder change-out.  All employees are trained in the maintnenance and operating procedures at this facility when they are hired, and throughout their employement.  The operating and training procedures were last reviewed June 1, 1999.  The employees at Conway Water Treatment Plant are trained by on-th-job training.  The last review of maintenance procedures was June 1, 1999.  There have been no incidents or accidents in the past five years.  The last hazard review was conducted in February of 1999 by use of a fault tree analysis.  The prevention program for this facility is required to be a Level 2, however, a Level 3 PSM Prevention program has been added for a more effective release prevention program.",

      "SummaryText": "In this water treatment plant facility (Conway Water Treatment Plant) we handle chlorine which are considered hazardous by EPA, OSHA, etc.  The same properties that makes chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical, also makes it necessary to onbserve certain precautions in handling chlorine.  Overall, the prevention of unnecessary human exposures, reducing the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and reducing the threat to nearby members of the communtiy is the main goal of incorporating this Risk Management Plan into our daily operations.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle and use chlorine combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, with the safe handling procedures that we utilize, along with the training of our personnel.\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to treat the water supply by utilizing chemicals such as chlorine.  Chlorine is received by individual one ton cylinders and stored until needed.  Chlroien is fed into the water system by automatic vacuum operated feeders.  The vacuum system will help prevent the continual operation of the chlorine feed if there is an increase or decrease in pressure or flow on th feed lines.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, aithorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.  The maximum amount of chlorine at this Conway Water Treatment Plant is 12,000 pounds.\n\nOur employees conduct proper cylinder change-out procedures daily.  They also review operating procedures and maintenance tasks daily or as needed.  The prevention program for this facility is a Level 2.  Lock-out/Tag-out Procedures are used to help prevent an accidental release of chlorine.  When maintenance is conducted on the chlorination system, the Plant Supervisor (Keith Rains), the Chief of Plant Operations (Mike KcKaskle), and the Water Manager (David Br"

All operators at this facility are knowledgeable in the proper start-up and shut-down procedures for the water treatment operations.  All guages, valves, fitings, etc. are checked daily, if not every hour.\n\nOur emergency response (action) program was developed with the assistance of Environmental Data Services, Inc., the Conway Fire Department, and the Faulkner County LEPC.  If a chlorine release occurs at the Highway 319 location, the chlorine alarm will sound which will notifypersonnel at the facility of a release.  Plant Supervisor (Keith Rains) will get personnel organized for an emergency action and possible evacuation.  On-duty personnel have SCBA equipment that they will use to enter the confined space (due to toxic atmosphere) and determine extent of release.  They can perform an emergency action by attempting to shut-off the chlorine cylinder by using the manual valve.  If the release cannot be controlled by the manual valve shut-down, then evacuation procedures will then be followwed.  A head count will be made of employees and David Bradley (Water manager) will be contacted, then the 911 call will be ade to notify the Conway Fire Department, Faulkner County LEPC, and Conway Police Department of the release.  Conway Fire Department will organize the Emergency Response activities, and will start evacuation of the affected population.  The release could be slowed by not starting the manual vent system in the chlorine room until notification to 911 system is made, and evacuation activities can begin.  This will not prevent chlorine from releasing, but will allow for some time to respond.\n\nThe worst case scenario for this facility is a one ton cylinder failure, which would be a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas into the atmosphere.  Active mitigation has been considered for this scenario "

      "SummaryText": "consisting of manual shut-offs, and automatic vacuum feed chlorine system.  Passive mitigation has also been considered for this release scenario, which would be a release into an enclosed space with litte contact outside air.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released as vapor.  the distance to endpoint of 0.087 mg/l for the worst case scenario is 3.5 miles.  The area surrounding the facility is considered to be urban due to the thick trees and vegetation, as well as the hilly terrain.  The worst case scenario would impact approximately 9700 persons.\n\nAn alternate release scenario was determined for the Highway 319 location.  The chlorine cylinders operate on an automatic vacuum feed system, so the amount of chlorine released at the Highway 319 location would be minimal (approximately 10 pounds).  This release of chlorine would result in a distance to endpoint of approximately 0.08 miles.  This relatively short distance would impact approximately 5 persons n(all populations were based on Landview Software).\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine from this facility in the past five years.  The automatic vacuum feed system helps prevent/limit releases of chlorine that could escape during operational periods.  Operators of the chlorination system are requried to check instrument, cylinders, feed systems, etc. on a daily basis to aid in the prevention of accidental releases.  Even though this is a Level 2 Prevention Program, Conway Corporation has chosen to utilize Level 3 Process Safety Management Prevention Program to furthur emphasize their efforts in preventing accidental releases.\n\nThis water treatment facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with all applicable state/federal regulations."
