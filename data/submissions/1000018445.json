      "SummaryText": "The Airgas Great Lakes Midland MI facility is located at 2325 Salzburg Road, Midland, Michigan.  Management and employees at the Midland facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of acetylene.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\nThe primary facility operation is the manufacture, storage and distribution of acetylene gas.  Acetylene is manufactured by the addition of calcium carbide into water in a reactor vessel.  A chemical reaction takes place and acetylene gas is produced.  The acetylene gas is compressed and filled into cylinder or distributed via pipeline.  The acetylene cylinders contain a filler and acetone.  The acetone dissolves the acetylene in the cylinder.  Each cylinder is checked by weight to verify they have the correct amount of product.  Cylinders are then stored for distribution.\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenario reports can be viewed at the facility and were prepared using the EPA look up tables  and RMP*Comp.  Mitigation systems are in place throughout the process.  These systems reduce the likelihood of a release and are also designed to reduce the magnitude of release should it occur.  The mitigation methods include check valves, pressure relief devices, flash-back arrestors, vents, grounding equipment, purge systems and written maintenance and operating procedures.\nThere have been no reportable accidents during the past five years involving the covered process.\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention plan designed to prevent the release of acetylene.  The program utilizes technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.\nEmployees are frequently consulted concerning various aspects of the program and process.  They area asked to provide input regarding safety and oper"

This information is utilized to develop a process hazard analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decision for improving safety and reducing the consequences of an acetylene release.  The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions and external factors that may impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process.  The PHA is reviewed and updated every 5 years.\nDetailed operating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The operating procedures are reviewed periodically and revised as necessary.  Employees participate in this process.\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contract employees.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices emergency procedures, evacuation and emergency response, safety rules, hazardous work authorization and other pertinent safety information.  Training is provided to employees through classroom and on the job training.  Demonstrations, observations and written tests are utilized to verify employee understanding.\nA contractor safety and evaluation process is in place to ensure contract employees hired to perform work can accomplish assigned tasks without comprising safety and integrity of the covered process.  The contractor program includes a review of contractor safety performance.\nPre-start up safety reviews are used with new or modified processes.\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program is used to ensure safe process operations.  Equipment used to store, process or handle acetylene has been designed, installed and maintained to minimize potential for release.  The maintenance program includes the required i"

The hazards identified are communicated to all affected employees and appropriate control measures are taken to prevent an accidental release.  The program includes lock out, tag out procedures, hot work, elevated work, line breaking and requires appropriate authorizations.\nManagement of change procedures has been developed to review proposed changes to the covered process.  MOC procedure includes changes to equipment, process or procedures that are not considered replacement in kind.\nProcess incidents that result in or could have resulted in a release are investigated and documented.  The purpose of the incident investigation process is to ensure appropriate and adequate corrective actions are implemented to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents.  \nThe facility has an emergency preparedness/response plan.  The plan outlines actions to be taken in the event of an emergency at the facility.  \nThe facility receives a compliance audit in accordance with EPA Risk Management Standard Part 68 at least once every 3 years.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the risk management system.  An audit tool is used to conduct the audit, document deficiencies and track status of identified deficiencies.  A procedure is in place to ensure appropriate follow-up.  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess overall facility compliance.\n"
