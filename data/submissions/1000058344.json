The environmental, health and safety program at LMEC includes this CalARP RMP and the aqueous ammonia system manual.\r\n\r\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment. Los Medanos Energy Center has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\n1.3 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Information\r\n\r\nThe Los Medanos Energy Center is located approximately 0.5 miles northeast of Pittsburg, California in Contra Costa County.  LMEC is situated on a 12-acre site at East 3rd Street, east of the intersection of East 3rd and Harbor. The facility sits on the northwest corner of property owned by USS-POSCO Industries. The plant is a merchant facility marketing electrical power on the open power exchange market and ancillary service support to the California Independent Systems Operator (CAL-ISO) grid. Lines owned by Pacific Gas and Electric transport electricity generated by this facility.  LMEC will provide steam and electricity to USS-POSCO and backup steam to Dow Chemical. \r\n\r\nThe facility currently stores aqueous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in two 10,000 gallon steel bulk storage tanks.

A high level switch with alarming function in the control room is provided for leak detection of the annular space of each storage tank.\r\n\r\nUnderground Containment Tank.\r\nThe ammonia unloading area has been designed so that any spillage of aqueous ammonia during an ammonia truck offload would be directed to a sump where it will be valved and piped to an underground containment tank.   Except during delivery of ammonia, the valve to the containment tank will be kept closed.  Rainwater collected on the unloading station will be pumped out as needed. The underground containment tank is equipped with a sump into which a submersible pump can be lowered to pump out the contents when required for disposal.\r\n\r\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash.\r\nTwo emergency showers and eyewash stations are located at the truck unloading station; within a few steps of the truck fill and vapor return connections. The emergency showers and eyewash stations employ activation switches that alarm in the control room when in use.\r\n\r\nStop Valve.\r\nTwo emergency stop valves are provided on the main liquid line on the tank suction. The valve position indication is wired directly to the DCS system. In the event of a fire or ammonia spill, the operator is to manually initiate a valve closure.\r\n\r\n1.5.3 Prevention Program Elements\r\n\r\nThe Los Medanos Energy Center accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\r\n- Detailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles\r\n\r\n- Comprehensive safety process information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors\r\n\r\n- Comprehensive preventive maintenance program\r\n\r\n- A hazard review of equipment and procedures with operation and maintenance staff participation\r\n\r\n- Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\r\n\r\n- Use of a"

Ammonia is pumped from a storage tank, diluted with exhaust gases, and injected into the two HRSG Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions. The Auxiliary Boiler utilizes air blowers for dilution and injection of the ammonia into the boilerA\u00bfs injection grid. Figure 1-1 shows a diagram of the aqueous ammonia process.\r\n\r\nAs indicated in the table below, the Los Medanos Energy Center stores and handles a maximum of approximately 129,000 lbs (17,000 gallons) of aqueous ammonia at a concentration of 24.5 percent. This exceeds the EPA RMP and CalARP thresholds of 20,000 pounds for concentrations greater than 20 percent based on the pounds of ammonia in solution (e.g., 31,612 pounds) using the following equation:\r\n17,000 gallons x 7.59 pounds/gallon x 24.5 percent solution\r\n= 31,612 pounds of aqueous ammonia\r\n\r\nTherefore this process is subject to CalARP and federal RMP regulations. Aqueous ammonia is used for selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the exhaust of Heat Recovery Steam Generators and Auxiliary Boiler at the Los Medanos Energy Center. Because it is not part of the NAICS codes listed by USEPA in 68.10(d), it is not subject to CalOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (due to its concentration being less than 44 percent) and there are public receptors in the toxic endpoint zone for the worst-case release scenario for aqueous ammonia, the aqueous ammonia process falls into CalARP Program 2.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is also stored onsite, however the maximum quantity is well below the CalARP/RMP thresholds and is, therefore not subject to CalARP/RMP requirements.\r\n\r\n1.4 Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThis discussion is no longer required in the Executive Summary."

The program elements such as hazard reviews, compliance audits, and incident investigation result in the development of additional safeguards. Some of the physical safeguards that are part of the original design and are already in place include the following:\r\n\r\nPressure Relief Valves.\r\nEach aqueous ammonia storage tank is furnished with a pressure/vacuum relief valve assembly. The valve is set to protect the tank from overpressurization and to limit vacuum in the tank to 2 ounces per square inch vacuum. A pressure reducing station with appropriate pressure regulator, pressure gauge, valves, piping, and fittings are provided. An external pressure relief valve returned back to the storage tank is supplied.\r\n\r\nTank Level Indication.\r\nHigh and low tank level switches are provided on the storage tanks. The high level switches are interlocked with the unloading pump. The low level switches are interlocked with the supply pumps. The level switches are wired to the local panel as well as the control room. The interlocks included do not allow the unloading pump to operate with a high tank level in either tank. \r\n\r\nSecondary Containment.\r\nThe ammonia storage tanks are located in containment area that is 37 feet 6 inches long by 37 feet 4 inches wide by 2 feet 10 inches high.

A hazard review is a systematic effort to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  The hazard review focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human factors, and external events, including seismic events that might affect the process.  \r\nSeveral methodologies can be used to perform a Hazard Review or a Process Hazard Analysis as described in Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures, Second Edition with Worked Examples, Center for Chemical Process Safety of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 1992. For less complex systems, the What-if Analysis/Checklist method is commonly used. The What-If Analysis is a brainstorming approach in which the Hazard Review team identifies potential accidental release scenarios and recommendations for risk reduction.   The Checklist method uses industry checklists or checklists developed by staff familiar with the process. \r\nWith the concurrence of the Contra Costa County Health Services Department, the What-If Analysis/Checklist method was selected for evaluating potential accidental releases at Los Medanos Energy Center.

      "SummaryText": "anager and Operations Manager will control quality assurance for spare parts and replacement equipment. The maintenance personnel will order only replacement parts specified by the original manufacturer or that meet the specifications contained on the process drawings and in the equipment files. All maintenance personnel are responsible for verifying replacement part numbers, ratings, and materials of construction against manufacturer procedures and equipment specifications. The replacement part, manufacturer, and/or specifications cannot be substituted without approval by the Maintenance Manager who is required to evaluate whether any suggested change of an equipment part or manufacturer still satisfies the original equipment specifications and does not constitute a change under the management of change procedure. Any suggested substitution that constitutes a change will first be subject to the management of change procedure described in Section 8.1 of the Prevention Program. Spare parts are stored in original containers until ready for use.\r\n\r\nFor new capital construction projects, the facility must ensure that equipment, as it is fabricated, is acceptable for the process application in which it will be used. This includes a review of the acceptable operating ranges (e.g., pressure, temperature, etc.) materials of construction, and any applicable codes or standards. The facility will perform inspections of new equipment to verify proper installation and consistency with all design specifications.\r\n\r\nMaintenance Training\r\n\r\nInitial and refresher training is provided to all employees before they are allowed to service ammonia system processes. In addition to the initial classroom training as part of the RMP, maintenance personnel receive on-the-job training, and specific training to maintain covered equipment by the equipment vendor.\r\n\r\n1.5.9 Internal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every three years to verify compliance with the progra"

The investigation team, as a group, will investigate the incident by:\r\nA\u00b7 Interviewing staff involved in the incident\r\nA\u00b7 Interviewing other staff who have knowledge about the process that may be helpful in the investigation\r\nA\u00b7 Checking records such as alarm printouts\r\nA\u00b7 Discussing the incident as a group\r\nA\u00b7 Physically examining the process\r\nCalpine has complied a series of questions to help the investigation team identify some of the less obvious ways of preventing incidents. These questions may include:\r\nWHAT equipment failed?\r\nA\u00b7 How can the failure be prevented or made less likely to occur?\r\nA\u00b7 How can the approaching failure be detected?\r\nA\u00b7 How can the failure be detected once it occurs?\r\nA\u00b7 How can the consequences of the failure be mitigated?\r\nWHICH behavior failed? (Consider behavior of those who could operate, manage, supervise, train, check, and design better.)\r\nA\u00b7 What did we fail to do?\r\nA\u00b7 How can the failure be prevented or made less likely to occur? (Consider training, instructions, checking, etc.)\r\nWHICH material leaked, reacted, or exploded?\r\nA\u00b7 What is the purpose of the material?\r\nA\u00b7 What material could be used instead?\r\nAs part of the incident review, human error that may have contributed to the incident will also be reviewed. Such error may be classified as follows:\r\nA\u00b7 Failure to perform a required function\r\nA\u00b7 Performed required function out of sequence\r\nA\u00b7 Performed an unnecessary function\r\nA\u00b7 Failure to recognize a hazardous condition requiring correction\r\nA\u00b7 Inadequate or inappropriate response to a contingency\r\nA\u00b7 The wrong decision made to solve the problem\r\nA\u00b7 Poor timing\r\nA determination will be made as to whether the error can be corrected by instituting general or specific safeguards for the process, or whether it is necessary to institute additional training for employees.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation Report.\r\nThe Incident Investigation Team findings"

CICS serves as a central database for maintaining and communicating all near miss and injury related events throughout Calpine. The collection system consists of modules for providing details, defining contributing factors, and determining root causes. A seperate module called CAPA (Corrective Actions/Preventative Actions) is used to develop assignments and target dates for recommendations that are identified by the Incident Investigation Team. These recommendations are also disseminated throughout the Calpine Fleet in the form of a summarized Lessons Learned Bulletin.\r\nThe recommendations in CAPA will then be assigned by the Operations Manager to the appropriate staff (operations, maintenance, or engineering personnel) for prompt follow-up. Recommendations often require additional evaluation to determine if they are technically and/or economically feasible; therefore, the Operations Manager shall also list the target evaluation date, resolution and resolution date for each recommendation. It is the responsibility of the Operations Manager to ensure all recomendations are properly resolved and documented in the incident investigation report. Whenever a recommendation is not implemented, a written explanation of its exclusion shall be documented. The incident investigation shall be considered complete once all recommendations are resolved and documented.\r\nAny proposed changes to the covered process must be eviewed in accordance with the Management of Change procedures. Following these procedures will aid in identifying changes that will affect other sections of the plant.\r\n\r\nRecordkeeping\r\nAll written documentation, photographs, and/or drawings related to an incident investigation shall be retained by the EHS Manager for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\n1.5.11 Process Modifications \r\n\r\nLos Medanos Energy Center ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new regulated process at the plant, or"
