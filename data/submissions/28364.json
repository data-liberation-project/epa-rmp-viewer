The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Bulk Plant in LaBelle are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the LaBelle Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as crop nutrients.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 56,078 pounds in each of our two 12,000 gallon storage tanks and 46,732 pounds in our 10,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. The facility has forty-nine 1,000 gallon nurse tanks and 5 tank applicators, therefore the facility total maximum storage would be 383,237 pounds.\n    \n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 56,078 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.6 miles.\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3 transfer hose during receiving operations. This release is assumed to last approximately 2 minutes before automatic or manual shut-off stops the flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n4. The Accidenta"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.
