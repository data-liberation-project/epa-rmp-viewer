      "SummaryText": "Chemical & Metal Industries, Inc. (C&MI) is a manufacturer of antimony pentachloride catalyst.  Antimony pentachloride is a fluorination catalyst used primarily in the manufacture of refrigerants (CFC replacement fluorocarbons), fluoropolymers, and pharmaceuticals.  C&MI uses chlorine and chloroform in this manufacturing process.  In addition, C&MI utilizes reactor residues containing antimony chloride fluoride - a byproduct from the fluorocarbon manufacturing industry.  The utilization of this byproduct substantially reduces the amount of primary raw materials, including chlorine, necessary for manufacture.\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\nThe handling of antimony pentachloride and of the chlorine, chloroform, and other raw materials used in its manufacture requires certain safety precautions.  C&MI's manufacturing process is a closed system.  C&MI has developed an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan in accordance with applicable regulations.  This plan has been reviewed by several governmental agencies and consulting firms.  The plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department, county HazMat team, and potentially affected neighbors in the event of an unauthorized release of hazardous chemicals.  C&MI is dedicated to continual process and engineering improvements to reduce the amount of hazardous materials utilized and stored, to upgrade the manufacturing process and facility, and to improve process alarms and controls.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\nThe regulated substances handled at Chemical & Metal Industries, Inc. are chlorine and chloroform.  Chlorine is received and handled in one-ton cylinders.  The total inventory of chlorine stored at this plant is 12,000 lbs.  C&MI also receives and handles chloroform.  The maximum inventory of chloroform is 4,000 gallons (~50,000 lbs.); average inventory of chloroform is estimated to be 2,800 gallons (~35,000 lbs.).  The chloroform,"

The worst case release scenarios and the alternative release scenarios.\nWorst case scenario - Chlorine.\nThe worst case chlorine scenario is the failure of a one-ton cylinder releasing 2,000 lbs. of chlorine.  It is assumed that the entire contents of the cylinder are released in 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm) was determined to be 2.2 miles.  This distance does not reflect the active mitigation C&MI has taken to ensure no off-site consequences in the event of a chlorine release.  Namely, the existence of a chlorine room with separate scrubber system on back-up/emergency power sized to neutralize the entire contents of a ton-cylinder and automatic shut-off controls. \n\nAlternative release scenario - Chlorine.\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine assumes the failure of a one-half inch liquid chlorine transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L was determined to be less than 0.1 miles.  This scenario does consider active mitigation of the scrubber system with a 99.97% efficiency of chlorine neutralization.\n\nWorst case scenario - Chloroform.\nThe worst case scenario for chloroform assumes the failure of a process vessel containing 800 gallons of chloroform.  This vessel is located in an indoor, diked area.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.49 mg/L was determined to be 0.1 miles.\n\nAlternative release scenario - Chloroform.\nThe alternative release scenario for chloroform assumes the failure of a bottom valve on the aforementioned process vessel.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.49 mg/L was determined to be less than 0.1 miles.\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "titute as applied to C&MI's unique process.\n\n5. Five-year accident history.\nMarch 18, 1999: C&MI had an accidental release of approximately 110 gallons (1,855 lbs.) of spent antimony catalyst.  This spent catalyst did not contain either free chlorine or chloroform.  However, antimony pentachloride will react with moisture in air to form hydrogen chloride gas.  An estimated 226 lbs. of hydrogen chloride was released.  No one off-site or on-site was injured.  Surrounding businesses were evacuated and adjacent streets and highway closed.  The incident was initiated by a defective valve on a one-ton tank containing spent antimony catalyst.  The valve had been installed by a customer, and the tank was undergoing its initial check in.  The operator sampling the tank was unable to reclose the tank valve.  To prevent a recurrence, C&MI has redesigned its sampling equipment and procedure.  The new closed sampling system was demonstrated to OSHA and the Denver Fire Department.  Steps have been taken to ensure customers send only C&MI approved valves on tanks of spent antimony catalyst and that C&MI operators do not attempt procedures with non-approved tank valves.\n\nMarch 19, 1997: Due to an operational error, antimony pentachloride was misdirected to a caustic scrubber system causing a release of an estimated 347 lbs. hydrogen chloride.  Approximately 10 people were evacuated from the business immediately north of C&MI's operations.  They were taken to a hospital for observation and released.  No on-site or off-site injuries occurred.  Additional alarms, process monitoring, and operating procedures were instituted.  A ventilation fan on the north side of C&MI's production operations was removed to reduce off-site impacts.  Additional emergency notification procedures were instituted.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program.\nC&MI's Emergency Response and Contingency Plan (ERCP) was developed to comply with OSHA, EPA, and NFPA standards and guidelines.  It has been submitted to and revi"

C&MI conducts on-site training and drills specific to process chemicals and equipment.  Annual training is conducted at Red Rocks Community College.  C&MI has Personal Protective Equipment, portable gas monitoring equipment, patching utilities, and neutralizing agents to handle a chemical release.  All mitigation efforts will be coordinated with local authorities.  \n\nFacility safeguards are in place to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of a chemical emergency.  These safeguards include: (1) C&MI has a chemical operator training program that includes weekly safety meetings and written and demonstration certification testing.  (2) Chemicals are handled in a closed system vented to a neutralization scrubber.  (3) Process equipment has been designed, tested, and engineered specifically for process conditions.  (4) C&MI's primary manufacturing chemicals do not burn or ignite and there is no potential for a runaway reaction.  (5) C&MI's facility is equipped with a gas monitoring system which activates automatic shutdown and emergency interlocks and notifies plant personnel and on-call managers.  (6) The perimeter of the process building is diked to contain a liquid spill anywhere within the building.  (7) Chemical loading areas (railcar and truck docks) have liquid containment systems.  (8) Chlorine is stored and dispensed within a dedicated, negative pressure room vented to an emergency neutralization scrubber having a reported removal efficiency of 99."

This relocation allowed a complete redesign and upgrade of the manufacturing and storage facility.  The relocation considers facility siting to reduce the potential for off-site impacts.  The relocation site is adjacent to C&MI's supplier of chlorine and other raw materials, thus reducing hazardous materials transportation distances.\n\nC&MI has a continuing program to evaluate and improve the safety of its processes, procedures, and equipment.
