In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Company, Eergency Response Personnel and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510 \"Establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal grain elevators\" however, we are also engaged in providing \"agriculturall inputs\" that include the receiving, storage and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing and reloading is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage\".  Althouth Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle crop protectants and petroleum products which are included in our planning, training and maintenancde programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will be included in this report.\n\nThe facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery.  Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site, therefore item number 1.11 is Zero.  Our facilites have adequate lighting and are inspected at various times of the day and night throughout the year.  Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct applicatio"

The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off-loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank.\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe \"worst-case scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank.  The maximum quantity released based on EPA's RMP-Comp Program (Version 1.06) as well as possible public and environmental receptors within the area have been provided to the County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) to assist them in their planning.\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThere has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site.  We believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual and self-closing excess flow valves so our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) has been determined per instructions by EPA guidance.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM:\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) K-61.1 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" ; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to:  Excess flow valves, emergency shutoff valves, barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles and Lockouts to prevent tampering when the site is unattended.  We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have prov"
