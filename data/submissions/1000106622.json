A Compliance Audit was complete November 2020. In addition Costco uses PSM Team meeting and 3rd party contractor ammonia refrigeration system inspection to ensure a safe system. Recommendation generated from these activities are tracked on the Costco Google Drive to ensure follow-through and completion."

The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines accident as the following:\n\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n1) On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n2) Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\n\nA review of the facility's accident history revealed there have been no RMP reportable accidents as defined above in the last five years (August 2018 - August 2023).\n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility. Emergency response activities are coordinated with the West Palm Beach Fire Rescue.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments. If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, calls will be made to the following organizations:  the National Response Center and the Florida Emergency Spill Reporting (State Warning Point).\n\nThe plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP"

Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for several areas (Cross Dock, Meat Cooler, and the Engine Room. The majority of the system equipment is located in the ammonia Engine Room.  The condensers are mounted on the Engine Room roof, the water diffusion tank is located underground outside the west building entrance, and the evaporators are placed in the cold storage areas with 1 unit in the ammonia engine room for temperature control. \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration service firm to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and the cold storage areas.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases. \n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves to an underground water diffusion tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.
