The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nS&S Foods maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The Plan is reviewed and updated as needed to ensure it remains an accurate reflection of the facility's policies regarding evacuation and protocol to deal with emergency scenarios.\n\nS&S Foods coordinates emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of S&S Foods to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The S&S Foods Chief Engineer / Engineer will be available for guidance and assistance.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe S & S Foods facility began operation of the facility in 1998.  The building was constructed in 1984 with several additions/modifications taking place since then.  The ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code (1994 updated to 1997), Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code.  The refrigeration system at the facility was installed with and has operated using R-22, a freon-based refrigerant.  It"

      "SummaryText": "was designed with the intent of switching refrigerants to ammonia so that very few equipment/piping modifications were necessary.  The initial ammonia charge was received by the facility at the time that the Phase 3 expansion was finalized which included the addition of a process spiral freezer (IQF), several evaporators for new cold rooms, one compressor, and two vessels.  The refrigeration system was shut down, purged of R-22, and restarted using ammonia in November 2000.\n\nThe facility processes meat products that are distributed to fast food establishments.  The facility is located at 1120 W. Foothill Blvd. in Azusa, California, just north of the Interstate 210 freeway, between Irwindale Avenue and Vernon Avenue.  The immediate area is primarily commercial with some light industrial and residential areas.  The ammonia system was upgraded to meet the requirements of the current applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes, as well as the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations that pertain to the use of ammonia.\n\nThe refrigeration system uses approximately 20,000 pounds of ammonia to maintain low temperatures for cold storage and for blast freezing food products.  The cold storage areas include: Finished Goods, Raw Goods, Blend/Grind, Dock, Freezer, IQF (Individual Quick Freeze), and the Fajita Process.  There are also multiple spiral production freezers.\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the Thermosyphon Receiver (TSV-1) to the High Pressure Receiver (HPR-1), which is the main liquid storage vessel in the system.  The HPR transfers high pressure liquid through the Intercooler (IC-1) in order to subcool it prior to routing to each of three Low Pressure Receivers (LPR-1, LPR-2, LPR-3).  Each Low Pressure Receiver operates an independent system with a specific process freezer(s).  The HPR also supplies high pressure liquid to the Controlled Pressure Receiver (CPR-1), wh"

      "SummaryText": "ich maintains a constant pressure through the use of pressure regulating valves.  CPR-1 is the main liquid supply vessel for the evaporators.  As the liquid ammonia enters the various evaporator/freezer coils, it expands, reducing the temperature.\n\nAs heat from the room (or product in the Spiral Freezers) is transferred to the low temperature liquid ammonia in the coils, the ammonia is (partially) vaporized.  The suction from the evaporators is pulled to the Suction Accumulator vessel (AC-1).  The suction from each of the spiral freezers is returned to the corresponding Low Pressure Receiver.  Six compressors (HC-1, HC-2, HC-3, LC-1, LC-2, and BC-1) pull the gaseous ammonia from the suction vessels and work in combination to compress the low pressure ammonia to high pressure gas (hot gas).  The hot gas is discharged through a common header to the Condensers (EC-1, EC-2), where fans and sprayed water are used to condense the ammonia in the coils back into a liquid.  As the ammonia changes phase into liquid, the heat from the system is discharged to the atmosphere.  The liquid is then drained into TSV-1, which is used to provide liquid ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  High pressure liquid in TSV-1 that is not needed for compressor oil cooling drains back into the HPR-1 to start the refrigeration cycle again.\n\nHot gas (high stage compressor discharge) is also used for defrost in the evaporators and for pressurizing liquid transfer tanks associated with the recirculator vessels.  The system also has an emergency dump tank (into which a common relief header vents), which is kept full of water.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensables (i.e. air) collected in the system.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relieve high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through a common header in case of a high pressure event.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe"

      "SummaryText": "S&S Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the S&S Foods facility utilizes the continuing services of a professional refrigeration operations and maintenance company to assist with required inspections and tests and to conduct any necessary repairs to the ammonia refrigeration equipment.\n\nThe S&S Foods facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  The ammonia sensor in the machine room is interlocked to: 1) provide alarms for facility operators (via a telemetry system), 2) shut down the system, and 3) activate emergency ventilation that scrubs ammonia through a water reservoir.  There is also an emergency button located outside the machine room that when manually activated, will shut down the machine room equipment.\n\nIn addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located (inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank where any ammonia vapors are neutralized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or rel"

No injuries have occurred at the facility (or off-site) due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration process. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nS&S Foods has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire Department and the City of Azusa Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the LA County Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center would be called.\n\nThe S&S Foods facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The General Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he is not available.  S&S Foods maintains a safety committee whose members include the designated emergency coordinators for the facility plus corporate representation.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe facility has worked to address safety issues as they arise in a continued effort to ensure a safe work environment.
