The exhaust gases leaving the turbines are sent through a two-part catalyst system to reduce the emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide by over 90 percent.  Reduction of NOx is accomplished by injecting ammonia vapor into the exhaust gas upstream of a selective catalytic reactor (SCR).  The SCR converts the NOx particles in the exhaust stream to a harmless mixture of nitrogen and water.  The ammonia vapor is generated by controlled release to the exhaust stream of anhydrous ammonia which is liquefied under pressure during storage.\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process because it is covered under OSHA Process Safety Management rules.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in one pressurized tank with a capacity of 12,000 gallons.  Liquid Loading procedures only allow 87% filling capacity; therefore the maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at our facility is 10,440\u00c2\u00a0gallons (~54,022 lb.).\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at our anhydrous ammonia source.\n\n1.3.1 Process Safety Information\n      Naniwa Energy, LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\n1.3.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n      Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

The facility is also subject to the requirements of OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management program under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The requirements of the PSM program are essentially equivalent to RMP and, therefore, the safety program developed for the facility incorporates the requirements of both programs.\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Naniwa Energy, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Storey County LEPC has been provided with a copy of Naniwa\u00c2\u00bfs Risk Management Plan.\n1.2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Tri-Center Power Plant produces electrical energy from fossil fuels. The operations are located in McCarran, Nevada. We employ approximately 3 people at the site and operate approximately 18\u00c2\u00a0hours a day 6 days a week during the peak season of June through August.  Non peak months the plant is normally manned Monday \u00c2\u00bf Friday 0700-1700 and continuously monitored through a remote monitoring service.
