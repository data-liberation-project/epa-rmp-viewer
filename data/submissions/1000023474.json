Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tag out, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Cafe Valley, Inc. facility is located at 7000 West Buckeye Road. The facility is approximately 1.6 miles south of the I-10 in west Phoenix on Buckeye.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mix of industrial warehouses, offices, retail and residential.\n \nThe Cafe Valley facility was constructed in 2010 with Sept 30, 2010 as the initial startup date. The primary business of this location is production of frozen bakery products.  The initial start-up charge was 9,200 lbs of ammonia.\n\nThe facility will use 13,822 pounds of ammonia in a single closed-loop ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThe refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration to accommodate the storage and production of various agricultural products.  \n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAdministrative Measures:  The facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\n\nA?    IIAR Bulletin 107, \"Suggested Safety and Operating Procedures When Making Ammonia Refrigeration Tie ins \"\nA?    IIAR Bulletin 109, \"Min"

IIAR, \"A Guide to Good Practices for the Operation of an Ammonia Refrigeration System\"\n\nPrevention programs are in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  \n\nEngineering Measures: It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization. The pressure relief valves vent to a water diffusion tank designed to hold one gallon of water per pound of ammonia which could be release from the largest relief valve in one hour.  An emergency pressure control system provided redundant shutdown of compressors on high pressure and equalize system pressures if activated.\n\nThe mechanical equipment area is equipped with an ammonia detection system designed to alarm at 25 ppm. \n\nEach freezer or cooler room is equipped with one or more ammonia detectors. These detectors will activate a visual and audible alarm inside and outside the room entrance at 25 ppm. In addition, at 25 ppm, the refrigeration controls will shut down the liquid feed solenoid valves to stop the flow of refrigerant into all air units in the affected room.   The detectors are monitored by an off-site security company which will notify appropriate facility management and emergency responders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERG"

      "SummaryText": "ENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Cafe Valley facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia and, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. \n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the operator plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSince this is a new facility (startup October 2010), there is no accident history to report.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Hazards Review was conducted September 3, 2010 and provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Cafe Valley facility. In addition to recommendations from the Hazard Review, the facility safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes \n"
