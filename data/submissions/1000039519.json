It is our intent not only to comply with the mandatory parts of these safety regulations, but also with the spirit of them.  We have designed this PSM/RMP program to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the PSM/RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.  We are committed to its' purpose.  We ask all employees and contractors to perform to the spirit and requirements of this program by learning how your job is an integral part the PSM/RMP program, by performing your work to the PSM/RMP Program requirements, and by making suggestions to improve the Program.\r\n\r\nThe Williams Station Power Plant is located on the Cooper River in lower Berkeley County in the Bushy Park Industrial area near Charleston.  The power plant generates 680 megawatts of electricity by burning pulverized coal in a single unit.  The plant can use No. 2 fuel oil as a backup fuel to the coal.  In addition the plant can produce 50 megawatts of electricity from two No. 2 fuel oil combustion turbines.\r\n\r\nThe Williams Station Power Plant has a SCR de-Nox system to lower its Nox emissions.  The SCR process utilizes anhydrous ammonia to react with the Nox compounds producing nitrogen and water.  The requirement for the addition of anhydrous ammonia necessitates the storage of large quantities of the ammonia.  The RMP program is initiated when a facility stores 10,000 lb. or more of anhydrous ammonia, which the Williams Station Power Plant will be doing.  The Williams Station Power Plant is rated a Program 3 facility.\r\n\r\nThe Williams Station Power Plant complies with the regulations of OSHA 1910.119 (PSM Regulations) and 40 CFR 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions Regulations - RMP).
