Anhydrous ammonia is an effective\n\nrefrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas\n\nat ambient temperatures, but is handled as a gas liquified under pressure. The refrigeration system consists\n\nof a high-pressure receiver, evaporative condensers, compressors, process air handlers, glycol chillers, low\n\npressure receiver, pumps, piping, and valves.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Berkeley Farms, LLC is committed to\n\npromoting safety for the plant, its employees, and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard(PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)1910.119, and EPA's\n\nRisk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of Ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they\n\ndo occur and to outline appropriate steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario: EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia\n\nRefrigeration\"(November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk\n\nManagement Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release\n\nscenario. The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur. The purpose of the worst case release\n\nanalysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and\n\nis not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and chemical-specific Prevention Steps: As a part of its PSM Program\n\nBerkeley Farms, Inc.

The plan includes adequate first aid, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public. In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911 which will notify the Hayward Fire Department. In addition, the Hayward Fire Department has included Berkeley Farms, LLC in its local emergency response planning.\n\nFive-Year Accident History: Berkeley Farms, LLC has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases\n\nover the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release\n\nduring this period.\n\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several Developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the\n\nvarious elements of our accidental release prevention program. Revised Standard Operating Procedures,\n\nupdated Emergency Response Plan, and a renewed emphasis on training are some of the major steps taken\n\nto improve safety. Changes in our program have been implemented by Berkeley Farms, LLC.\n\nIn addition, the facility will seek to operate and maintain our refrigeration system in accordance wit IIAR\n\nGuidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management\n\nProgram."
