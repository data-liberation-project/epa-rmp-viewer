Such \npressures could not be generated internally.

      "SummaryText": "1.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n1.1\tSOURCE\nThe Muller-Pinehurst Dairy is subject to the United Stated Environmental \nProtection Agency's (USEPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) for \nAccidental Chemical Release regulation (40 Code of Federal Regulations \n[CFR] 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the \nthreshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) \n(Chemical Abstract System Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia is a \ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream, \nmilk, and related products.  It is a closed system that contains \napproximately 13,800 pounds (i.e., 2,600 gallons) of ammonia in various \nphysical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the \nhigh pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 pounds per \nsquare inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 2,840 pounds of \nliquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 1,300 pounds.  Most \nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, \nmake-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \npiping, and equipment.\n\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Muller-Pinehurst Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage \nsystem.  The high pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (135 to \n190 psig) liquid ammonia to several units including:  the 3-barrel ice cream \nfreezer, lower cooler units, Mueller vat, ante room units, glycol chiller, \nsmall hardening room unit #2,"

The receiver also feeds ammonia to the intercooler, which in \nturn feeds additional units including: storage area unit, large hardening \nroom unit, small hardening room unit #1, new and old ice builders, and \nhalf-gallon air units 1 through 3. \n\nThe Mueller vat, hardening rooms, storage area, and ante room units \nreturn liquid/vapor ammonia to one of three suction traps.  The suction \ntraps are designed to supply liquid free suction to the booster \ncompressors.  Booster compressors supply ammonia vapor at 25 psig to \nthe intercooler.  Ammonia vapor from the intercooler is fed to one of five \nhigh stage compressors (four reciprocating compressors and one screw \ncompressor).  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \ngas), at 135 to 190 psig, is vented to two condensing towers.  The \ncondensed liquid is returned to the high-pressure receiver.\n\nA recirculator receives a liquid/vapor ammonia stream from the \nhollywood cooler units, lower cooler units, and McDonald's dock air unit.  \nLiquid ammonia is recirculated to these units via a pumper drum.  High-\npressure suction is directed to the booster compressor discharge header.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \nsafety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room \nventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the \ncompressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, \nand the intercooler from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety \ninterlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts \nfor the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the system \nvessels.  The high-pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n2.0\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.

The PHA will be updated and \nrevalidated every five years.\n \n? Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared in 1997 and 1998 to \nprovide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia \nrefrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal \noperation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency \nshutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature \nand pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe \noperating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they \noperate.\n \n? Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every \n3 years.  The training content is based upon the process safety \ninformation and operating procedures"

The training program ensures \nthat the operators understand the nature and causes of problems \narising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with \nrespect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration \nprocess.\n \n? Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, \npre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or \nexpansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent \nrecheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with \nthe engineering design and safety requirements.  \n \n? Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of \nammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.  The objective of the \ninvestigation is to correct deficiencies in such a way as to prevent \nrecurrence.\n \n? Contractors that are hired to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration \nsystem are pre-qualified based upon their knowledge of ammonia \nrefrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and \ntheir demonstrated ability to work safely.  \n \n? Prior to the performance of any hot work (i.e., spark or flame \nproducing operations such as welding, cutting, brazing, and grinding), \nmanagement must approve the work by executing a written hot work \nauthorization permit to verify that appropriate precautions to prevent \nfire have been implemented.\n \n? Periodic walk-throughs occur to find unusual or increasing vibration, \nincipient leaks, or other indications of potential upsets or failures that \ncould lead to a release.\n \n? Replacement of all pressure relief valves in 1999 and every 5 years \nthereafter.\n \n? Numerous safety systems including pressure relief valves and \nammonia vessel level controls and safety interlocks are used in the \nrefrigeration system.\n \n? Periodic inspections are performed for major powered equipment, \nincluding compressors, large fans, bearings, couplings, shaft seals, and \nmountings, etc., for vibration or incipient mechanical f"
