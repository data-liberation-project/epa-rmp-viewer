We are very conscious of the potential hazards that exist at our facility as well as the importance of proper maintenance of infrastructure and equipment.  Site security is a constant concern that we address.  We attend the yearly instruction on safe handling of Anhydrous Ammonia that is provided by the Illinois Department of Agriculture.  The Morrison Fire Department visits our facility annually to review action plans and handling procedures.  We have a written Emergency Action Plan in the event of a leak and require personal protective equipment for individuals who respond to such an incident.  We supply personal protective equipment to our customers using Anhydrous Ammonia.  We have our own regular inspections of our Anhydrous handling equipment as well as written maintenance records to monitor required equipment updates.  We are registered with Whiteside County LEPC and Illinois Department of Agriculture for reportable quantities of Anhydrous Ammonia.  We also have a written Site Security Plan to further monitor and prevent unauthorized handling of our facilities and equipment."
