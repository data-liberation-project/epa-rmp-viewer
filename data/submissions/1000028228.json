As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC  completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the applicable RMP reporting threshold.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC  is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the flammable mixture natural gasoline (RMP-regulated components:  butane, isopentane, and pentane), which may be used as the ethanol denaturant, as well as aqueous ammonia.  Both the denaturant and the ammonia are stored in secondary containment to minimize the potential for off-site migration of spilled material and to allow for prompt response in the event of a material release. It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC  to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including accidental release of denaturant or aqueous ammonia, it is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC  to notify the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Aurora Fire department and evacuate all employees at Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires the use of a denaturant to render the distilled alcohol unfit for human consumption; denaturant is added to the distilled alcohol at a concentration of approximately 2 percent by volume.

Although the current Material Safety Data Sheet for the natural gasoline used at Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC lists the material as a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) Class 3 flammable, Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC is choosing to list it was an RMP-regulated flammable based upon a review of other MSDS for natural gasoline and past experience with this chemical.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 614,000 pounds (105,200 gallons).  The denaturant is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC's tank farm area which includes secondary containment.  \n\n\n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC also stores aqueous ammonia (31% maximum concentration) on-site in an above ground tank located within secondary containment.  Aqueous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum ammonia stored will be 170,000 pounds (70,700 gallons of aqueous ammonia at a maximum concentration of 31%).  \n\n\n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC has evaluated worst and alternative case scenarios as it relates to each of these reportable substances.  Emergency response programs for these scenarios have been prepared and implemented.  Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and conducts drills.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of denaturant and aqueous ammonia. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is very similar to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, "

Rather than prepare a complete Emergency Response Plan, Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC has chosen to maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance to ensure employee safety in the event of an emergency.  In general, the EAP provides procedures for employees to report a fire or other emergency; procedures for emergency evacuation; procedures to for employees who remain to operate critical plant operations prior to evacuation; contact information for employees responsible for communicating plan information; details regarding the employee alarm system; an employee training program for evacuation; and procedures for routine review and updates to the plan.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Pacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC has coordinated with the Hamilton County LEPC and is a part of the written community Emergency Response Plan.
