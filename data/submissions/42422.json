The facility has a training program, which includes both internal and external emergency responders.\n\nThe emergency release procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the North Lawrence Fire Department, the LEPC and OPTECH Environmental Services in the event of an emergency.\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substance\n\nThe North Lawrence New York Manufacturing Facility produces blended yogurt and cottage cheese.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 31151.  The facility is also capable of packaging yogurt and cottage cheese products.  Several areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve food products.\n\nAmmonia is the only North Lawrence New York Manufacturing Facility regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.  The quantity of ammonia presently stored on site is 18,000 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range concentration with a high ignition temperature.  Ammonia is not toxic, but can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concentrations can cause burns.  The potential risks of people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of the skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n3.0    General Accidental Release Pre"

The OSHA PSM program for prevention meets the EPA requirements for a RMP Program 3 Prevention Program and therefore makes the facility compliant with 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe PSM program contains 13 elements, which must be executed:\nEmployee Participation ? The purpose of this element is to ensure all employees have a voice in the PSM program and the operations of ammonia related equipment.\nProcess Safety Information ? The purpose of this element is to allow all process hazards to be identified and understood by all employees.\nProcess Hazard Analysis ? The purpose of this element is to identify, evaluate and control process hazards using a systematic approach.\nOperating Procedures ? The purpose of this element is to develop, implement and maintain clear instructions for the safe operation of the ammonia system.\nTraining ? The purpose of this element is dependent on role, personnel who may come in contact with ammonia, operate, maintain  or clean ammonia related equipment understand applicable health hazards and be able to perform the work safely.\nContractors - The purpose of this element is to ensure all contractors either directly working on or just in the facility understand the hazards of ammonia.\nPre Start Up Safety Review ? The purpose of this element is to ensure the safety and design issues are considered before hazardous materials are introduced to the process or system.\nMechanical Integrity ? The purpose of this element is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment and minimize the potential for catastrophic release.\nHot Work Permit ? The purpose of the element is to ensure fire prevention practices are used for any operation involving open flames, heat or sparks.\nManagement of Change ? The purpose of this element is to ensure that process changes a"

The purpose of this element is to minimize the impact of incidents by investigating the root cause of any incident or near miss.\nEmergency Action Plan ? The purpose of this element is to ensure the facility has adequate means of addressing incidents as they occur.\nCompliance Audit ? The purpose of this element is to verify that PSM procedures and practices are adequate and being followed and identify areas for improvement.\n\n4.0    Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases at this facility in the last five years.\n\n5.0    Emergency Response Program\n\nThe North Lawrence New York Manufacturing Facility has combination emergency response plan which addresses the accidental discharge of hazardous substances and hazardous waste to the environment, measure to be taken to prevent an accident, countermeasures to be taken in the case of an accident and procedures for containing and limiting the duration of the emergency measures to be employed for further protection of employees responding to an emergency, as well as other plant personnel.\n\nThe plan incorporates the SPCC plan, by reference, which includes the locations, types and amounts of hazardous substances stored on site, notification procedures, and countermeasures to be taken in the event of a spill.  The plan also incorporates established procedures to notify appropriate agencies and company personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\nOur comprehensive emergency response plan is designed to protect our employees, environment and the community and requires that: all nonessential personnel immediately exit the facility affect by the release and notification of local officials if their assistance is necessary.\n\n6.0    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges to the North Lawrence New York"
