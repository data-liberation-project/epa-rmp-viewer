If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for applicationfor crop production nutrients.\nThe maximun quantity stored would be 97000 pounds in our two-12000gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport holding 180000 pounds.\nThe worst-case release scenaeio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 45000  pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 80 percent capacity as limited by the owners instructions and design standards. The distance to the endpoint is .64 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a hose. The distance to the endpoint is    miles.\nThe facility has implemented the provisions and is in compliance with the Oklahoma Dept. of Agrilculture.\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage.\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38\nThe facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title lll \nThe facility has a written responce program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\nPlanned changes to improve safety.
