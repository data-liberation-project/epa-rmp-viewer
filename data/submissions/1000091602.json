This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the blending, repackaging, bulk and warehouse storage of chemicals, and their distribution via Univar's fleet of delivery trucks. We have four regulated toxic substances present above threshold quantities at our facility. These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Cyclohexylamine  [Cyclohexanamine], Formaldehyde (solution), and Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid [Hydrofluoric acid]. These substances are delivered to our facility by common carrier truck in sealed, UN rated containers and stored in our warehouse for distribution to end-use customers.  \n\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) software was used for modeling purposes.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 Toxic Regulated Substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Warehousing Operations. In this scenario, 2,477 pounds of Aqua Ammonia is released. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is "

The surface area of the released quantity has been restricted from spreading to the maximum capacity of the source by a passive mitigation system (berm). At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.1 mile is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Aqua Ammonia involves a release from Warehousing Operations. The scenario involves the release of 413 pounds from a drum failure. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as berms and enclosures and active mitigation controls such as a sprinkler system and an Emergency Response Team and equipment, while present at the facility, were not taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of Aqua Ammonia is 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe facility maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What If?\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA was performed on November 16, 2020.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, our facility maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nWe have a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; forklifts and forklift attachments, electric pallet jacks, drum dollies, fire systems, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nUnivar conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner. The most recent 3-Year Compliance Audit was conducted November 18, 2020.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWe promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nUnivar truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from PHA in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. The company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractors work and the processes"

Five-year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years. Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases involving RMP chemicals during this period.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nOur facility carries a written Emergency Response/Contingency Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The Plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department is the primary local emergency response agency with whom our Emergency Response/Contingency Plan has been coordinated and verified."
