(GAS) Pleasant Grove Facility (Facility) located at 4036 Pleasant Grove Road, Pleasant  Grove, California 95668 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed Emergency Response/Contingency Plan (ER/CP) has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n??    The Facility is a retail agricultural facility whose primary activity is the storage and sale of fertilizers in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to agricultural operations in Northern California.\n\n??    Aqua ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. Aqua ammonia is received by truck and stored in two 25,000-gallon, above-ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 380,000 pounds.    \n\n3.    THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario were evaluated for the regulated process.  The results of the evaluation are provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\n4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Facility has implemented the following prevention program elements.\n\nSafety Information:  GAS ensures that information concerning covered processes and regulated substances are up-to-date and available for review by employees.  The most recent review of safety information pertaining to the covered process took place in April 2015.\n\nHazard Review:  A hazard review of the aqua ammonia process is conducted every five years or as needed by changes in the proc"
