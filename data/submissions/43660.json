The cogeneration facility provides steam to the Navy and electricity to the electric utility company, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).  The major system components are a gas turbine generator, a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), a steam turbine generator, and associated equipment and control systems.  The facility began commercial operations in 1989.\n\nAE LLC uses anhydrous ammonia (NH3) to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from the gas turbine exhaust at the cogeneration facility.  NORIS also uses anhydrous NH3 in a refrigeration system for cooling the gas turbine inlet air.  Ammonia vapor from the accumulator tank is compressed and cooled to form liquid NH3.  The liquid NH3 is sent through the cooling coils where it cools the gas turbine inlet air before returning to the accumulator tank.  The chiller system was installed at NORIS in 1992.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a horizontally mounted tank.  The maximum capacity of the tank is 4,500 gallons. The tank contents are limited to a maximum of 4,000 gallons (24,320 lbs.).  There is also a closed chiller system with 2,330 gallons (14,666 lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia.  Annual consumption of ammonia is approximately 51,332 gallons. \n\n1.3    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAs a facility constructed and operated to provide steam to the Navy and electricity to SDG&E, AE LLC?s cogeneration facility is vital to national security and must be operated safely and efficiently. \n\nThe facility maintains, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health A"

Other than the addition of these valves (and related process/SOP updates)  and replacement of equipment, the facility has not undergone any significant changes in its process, SOPs, maintenance system, training program, or equipment.\n\n\n\nRecommendations made as part of the review for the 1999 federal RMP and CalARP, and the subsequent triennial audit conducted in 2002 were implemented, unless otherwise indicated. Recommendations from the 2004 RMP update will be implemented by January 1, 2005, unless otherwise indicated.  These are: \n\n\n\n1) Change facility P&ID to reflect replacement of the old chiller condenser (1,560 ton) with a Baltimore Air Coil 1,810 ton system. \n\n\n\n2)  Update the Site map to reflect removal of Cabrillo Power?s gas turbines, and associated equipment and structures, as well as addition of adjacent 227,000-gallon fuel storage tank to the facility?s operations.\n\n\n\n3) Make a list of operating procedures with review/revision date and reviewer?s name, and place inside SOP (a.k.a. SDOI) manual\n\n\n\n4) Update HMBP, PSM, EAP, and SPCC to reflect changes in the facility, including replacement of halon system with CO2, and addition of fuel storage tank, and keep records of revisions with the name and signature of reviewer, date, and text of changes in each plan.\n\n\n\n5) Complete Management of Change procedures to document addition of solenoid isolation valves in ammonia tank.\n\n\n\n6) Develop Contractor Certification Statement and documentation that contractors follow design codes, and that their safety programs meet regulatory requirements and conform to AE LLC?s policies and procedures and PSM requirements.\n\n\n\n7) Evaluate the ammonia transfer operations to ensure prevention of excess flow, and update procedures and relevant portion of P&IDs for ammonia transfer operations, as needed.\n\n\n\n8) Evaluate options and determine approach for the conduct of an updated PHA on the chiller system, and"
