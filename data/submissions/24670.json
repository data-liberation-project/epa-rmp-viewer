As many as 200 cylinders of various sizes up to435 pound capacity may be present onsite.  The maximum intended inventory is 150,000 pounds.  Propylene is used as a fuel and welding catalyst.\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the referenced process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor:  Within the past five years, no accidental release has caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule.  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of a fire, explosion, or the release of a regulated substancefrom the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP.  The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n------------------------------\nSignature\n\n-----------------------------\nTitle\n\n-----------------------------\nDate signed"
