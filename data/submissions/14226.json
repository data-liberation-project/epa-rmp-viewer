      "SummaryText": "The facility is known as Oak Farms Dairy, located at 1101 Faulkner Lane in Waco, Texas.  The facility processes fluid milk and possesses an extensive refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is the sole regulated substance with regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The system contains approximately 10,000 pounds.\n\nReleases are prevented by engineering and administrative controls, employee training and annual procedural reviews.  Preventive system maintenance includes regular inspection,repair and replacement of components as necessary.  Automated and manual emergency shutdown procedures minimize the likelihood of a sustained release.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios indicate that toxic endpoints may extend as far as 1/2 mile from the facility.  Written emergency response procedures and an on-site response team further mitigate potential release impact.\n\nNo reportable releases have been experienced at this facility."
