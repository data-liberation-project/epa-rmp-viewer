Preventive system maintenance ensures mechanical integrity through regular inspection, repair and replacement of system components.  Annual training programs maintain employee awareness of process hazards.  A fully equipped emergency response team rehearses emergency scenarios semi-annually.  Automated system controls initiate shutdown when safe limits are exceeded and are augmented by manual isolation and shutdown procedures.",

The facility processes fluid milk and possesses an extensive refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is the sole regulated substance with regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The system contains approximately 10,000 pounds.\n\nReleases are prevented by engineering and administrative controls, employee training and annual procedural reviews.  Preventive system maintenance includes regular inspection,repair and replacement of components as necessary.  Automated and manual emergency shutdown procedures minimize the likelihood of a sustained release.\n\nWorst case and alternate release scenarios indicate that toxic endpoints may extend as far as 1/2 mile from the facility.  Written emergency response procedures and an on-site response team further mitigate potential release impact.\n\nNo reportable releases have been experienced at this facility."
