      "SummaryText": "The Niagara County Water District (NCWD) owns and operates the Williams Road Treatment Plant located in Niagara Falls, NY.  The plant includes a chlorine feed system as part of the treatment process.  The process qualifies as a Program 2 Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThe worst case scenario was modeled as an uncontrolled leak from a 2,000 lbs. tank.  It was estimated that the affected area from this leak would be confined within a radius of 1.5 miles.  The public receptors within this area are schools, residences, recreational area, and a commercial business area.  The alternative release scenario was modeled as a ruptured pipe connected to an automatic shutoff valve.  The alternative release would be contained onsite and would not effect the public.  The facility has not had any reportable accidents since the process was installed which is greater than the RMP requirement of reporting accidents within the past 5 years.\n\nThe NCWD has completed the following sections as required for the Program 2:  Proces Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, and Compliance Audit.  These sections are included in the facility's RMP.\n\nThe facility has a current emergency response plan in the event of a chlorine leak which includes the necessary steps to take to notify emergency response teams.\n\nThe NCWD maintains its RMP and all related information and documents on file at the facility."
