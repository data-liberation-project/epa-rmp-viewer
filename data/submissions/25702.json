The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations as required in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.  The goal of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.  The RMP regulations apply to facilities that handle, manufacture, use, or store toxic and flammable substances above specified threshold quantities. In addition to the RMP regulations, both the State of Washington and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, as defined in Washington Administrative Code (WAC), Chapter 296?67, and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.  As the PSM regulations contain similar requirements to the RMP requirements, Kelso\u00bfs RMP/PSM was developed with consideration to both.\n\nFoster Farms prepared the RMP/PSM to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve the anhydrous ammonia handling system and practices at the facility.  Foster Farms incorporated many state-of-the-art safety features into the ammonia refrigeration system at the facility as part of the original system"

Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM.  In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team for mitigation of the release.  Foster Farms will rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary. \n\nThe Foster Farms facility is located at 1700 South 13th Avenue in Kelso, Washington.  The surrounding area consists of industrial and commercial businesses.  The facility is in an industrial park that is generally bordered by Interstate 5 on the northeast and the Kelso Airport on the southwest.  The Cowlitz River, residential, and commercial development are located northwest of the industrial park.\n\nThe facility was constructed in 1998 for Foster Farms.  Operations at the facility consist of the slaughter, processing, storage, and packaging of poultry products.  The facility is surrounded by chain-link fencing and has a secured entrance that is staffed by security personnel 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in a refrigeration system at the facility.  The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 21,525 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The system provides cooling for production areas, product, water chilling, and ice making.  A central computer system monitors and controls the refrigeration system.  The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.

Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Foster Farms facility due to the quantity of ammonia used.  Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \u00bf\u00bfthe greatest amount held in a single vessel\u00bfreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.\u00bf  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for our facility was completed by Condor Earth Technologies Inc., using the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, November 1998 (EPA Model Program).  Consequence modeling was conducted to determine the release distances from the site.\n\nThe largest ammonia vessel at Foster Farms, the high-pressure receiver, has a capacity greater than the quantity of ammonia contained in the system.  The normal charge for the ammonia refrigeration system is approximately 21,525 pounds.  Therefore, the worst-case release scenario for the facility is a release of 21,525 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.  Catastrophic failure of the high-pressure receiver is required for this scenario to occur.  Release distances were calculated using Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, and toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l or 200 parts per million (ppm).  Results for the worst-case release were based on a toxic gas release that has been liquefied under pressure, and is located in an open space.  This resulted in a toxic endpoint distance of 1.76 miles.  This distance is slightly more than previously reported due to the use of updated information regarding the amount of ammonia contained in"

      "SummaryText": "the system and using a different modeling program.\n\nThe alternative scenario selected was of an ammonia release occurring due to failure of a pimp seal leak or gasket failure with a \u00bc\u00bf effective diameter office leading to an airborne release.  The scenario results in a release rate of 100 lbs/minute.  The duration of the release is assumed to be 10 minutes, and the total quantity released 1,000 pounds.  This time frame would be consistent with a typical accidental release, allowing time for the leak to be detected and isolated.  Using the weather conditions described in the EPA Model Program (wind speed of 3 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class D) and interpolating the tabulated values from Exhibit 4-5 of the same EPA Model Program, the predicted distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.10 mile.  This distance is slightly less than previously reported due to the use of a different modeling program.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Foster Farms has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia refrigeration system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with closed-loop ammonia systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Foster Farms ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control system that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  The major pressure vessels in the system are connected to a diffusion panel.  Ammonia from the vessels can be mixed with water (neutralized) to prevent over-pressurization of the vessels.  Further, all pressure vessels in the system are equipped with pressure relief valves.\n\nOther safety features at the facility include: \n\u00b7emergency shutdown systems\n\u00b7component specific safety shutdowns\n\u00b7an ammonia leak detection system is i"
