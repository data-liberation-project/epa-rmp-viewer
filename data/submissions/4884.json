      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe management and staff of the Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plant (PARWQCP) are committed to operating the Plant with the highest regard for the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment.  To ensure the safety of the public, Plant personnel, and the environment, PARWQCP has designed and implemented a management system that integrates the elements of Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, T8 CCR '5189, EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, 40 CFR part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, T19 CCR Div. 2, Ch. 4.5.  The policies and procedures integrated under PARWQCP's management system specifically address prevention of the release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, and emergency response to an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.\n\nDescription of Processes, and Regulated Substances Handled at PARWQCP\n\nThe Palo Alto Regional Water Quality Control Plant, located on San Francisco Bay in northeastern Palo Alto, receives and treats wastewater from Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, East Palo Alto, and Stanford University.  The Plant processes 25-30 million gallons of domestic and industrial wastewater per day.  The Plant provides primary and secondary treatment, final filtration, and disinfection.\n\nPrimary treatment removes scum and sludge from the wastewater influent.  The primary settling tanks allow particulate matter to settle out or float to the surface and be removed from the flow.\n\nSecondary treatment begins with BOD removal in aerobic, fixed-film reactors.  Aerobic aeration basins, with a retention time of 5 hours, are used to convert ammonia to nitrogen and nitrates.  From the aeration basins, the water moves into the secondary clarifiers, where settled activated sludge is removed.\n\nFinal filtration removes most of the oil, grease, and suspended solids from the secondary effluent.  The filtered"

      "SummaryText": "water then flows through several chlorine disinfection steps and final dechlorination before being discharged into San Francisco Bay or diverted to the Reclamation Facility.\n\nThe water discharged into the San Francisco Bay is frequently tested to confirm that the water is not harmful to wildlife.  In order to protect San Francisco Bay from the harmful effect of toxic substances such as heavy metals, PARWQCP requires residents, businesses, and institutions to reduce the amounts of these substances they release into the sewer.  The first metal targeted for reduction was silver, which is toxic to wildlife and has accumulated in clams in San Francisco Bay.  The Plant's discharge of metals into the Bay was reduced by 60 percent during the 1980's, as a result of the Industrial Waste Control Program and enhanced treatment at the PARWQCP.\n\nThere are two processes at PARWQCP which are subject to the RMP rule (as well as the CalARP program and the PSM standard):  the Chlorination process, and the Dechlorination process.\n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance handled in the Chlorination process.  Chlorine is used in the Chlorination process as a disinfectant.  Disinfection entails the destruction of pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses.  Chlorine acts as an oxidizer on pathogens, organic compounds, and reduced nitrogen compounds.  Typically, wastewater disinfection requires 40 to 60 grams of chlorine per cubic meter (about 264 gallons) of wastewater.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the Plant by tank truck.  The tank truck capacity is 18 tons.  The chlorine truck is connected to the chlorine unloading manifold with braided-steel, flexible hoses.\n\nThe Plant's chlorine bulk tank has a capacity of 25 tons.  The tank is constructed of steel.  The valves are identical to the valves on a chlorine railcar.  The liquid and gas lines are equipped with excess flow valves that limit the flow rate out of the chlorine bulk tank to a maximum of 7000 pounds per hour.  If chlorine i"

Two additional eductors within the chlorine building can be activated manually.  The eductors are capable of removing 21,000 pounds of chlorine per day.\n\nTon containers of chlorine are kept on standby, for use in the event of bulk chlorine unavailability.  The maximum amount of chlorine handled on-site (in bulk storage and ton containers) at any time is 74,000 pounds.\n\nChlorine vapor is metered through chlorinators on vacuum demand.  Each chlorinator consists of a vacuum regulator, a flow meter, a control valve, and a differential pressure regulator.  Downstream of the vacuum regulator, chlorine gas is handled at a pressure that is less than atmospheric.  A leak downstream of the vacuum regulator would result in air intrusion, rather than a chlorine release.  On loss of vacuum, or on loss of chlorine supply pressure, the vacuum regulator closes.\n\nVacuum is generated by eductors (also referred to as \"ejectors\").  In the eductors, chlorine is mixed with water.  The resulting solution is mixed with process water for treatment.  The vapor pressure of the chlorine solution is low enough that the solution does not pose a significant risk upon release.\n\nChlorine is a greenish-yellow gas at ambient temperature.  It has an intensely irritating odor, and is moderately toxic by inhalation.  Chlorine vapor is denser than air.  Chlorine is not flammable, although it will support combustion as an oxidizer.  Chlorine is only slightly soluble in water.  When chlorine reacts with water, a weak solution of hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids is formed.  These acids are corrosive to most common metals.  Chlorine reacts with many organic compounds to form chlorinated derivatives.  Hydrogen chloride is often formed as a by-product of these reactions.\n\nSulfur"

Sulfur dioxide is sparingly soluble in water, and will react with water to form a corrosive acid solution.  Sulfur dioxide vapor is denser than air.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario, and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe Plant's worst-case release scenario consists of a total release of the maximum inventory of the sulfur dioxide bulk tank.  The maximum inventory is 50,000 pounds.  While the maximum quantity of chlorine is also 50,000 pounds, the maximum distance to the endpoint for chlorine is shorter than the maximum distance to the endpoint for sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide bulk tank is located within a building.  In accordance with \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants,\" the release rate to the surroundings was calculated as 1700 lbs/min, with a duration of 10 minutes.  Note that this conservatively ignores the effectiveness of the emergency eductors in the storage room.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for sulfur dioxide is 0.0078 mg/L, which corresponds to 3 ppmv.  The worst-case release scenario was modeled with DEGADIS version 2.1.  The following inputs were applied:  wind speed, 1.5 m/s; stability class, F; surface roughness, 3 cm (appropriate for \"rural\"); release duration, 10 minutes; release rate, 12.88kg/s (corresponding to 1700 lbs/min).  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint was calculated as 4.8 miles.\n\nUsing Landview III, the population within 4.8 miles of the release point was estimated as 140,000.

There is an officially designated wildlife preserve within 4.8 miles of the release point.\n\nThe Plant's alternative release scenarios consist of a chlorine release and a sulfur dioxide release.  In both cases, the release scenario entails a leak in the vapor unloading piping outside of the Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide Building, which is conservatively assumed to persist for 10 minutes prior to isolation (which can safely and rapidly be accomplished remotely).  The alternative releases scenarios are assumed to occur during chlorine and sulfur dioxide truck unloading, through a hole with an effective diameter of 1/16 inch (as in \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\").  The chlorine gas pressure during unloading is typically 70 psig, and the sulfur dioxide gas pressure during unloading is typically 25 psig.  Under these conditions, 18 pounds of chlorine would be released (1.8 lbs/min), and 7.7 pounds of sulfur dioxide would be released (0.77 lbs/min).\n\nThe alternative release scenarios were both modeled with DEGADIS version 2.1.  The endpoints for both substances correspond to 3 ppmv.  Local meteorological data indicate that, coincidentally, 1.5 m/s, stability F is the most common wind speed/stability class combination (as was used for the worst-case release scenario).  Using these inputs, the distance to 3 ppmv chlorine was calculated to be 2400 feet, and the distance to 3 ppmv sulfur dioxide was calculated to be 1700 feet.\n\nThe population within the distances to the endpoints described above is known to be 2.
