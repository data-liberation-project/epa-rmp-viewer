Chlorine for the chlorination of the City's drinking water supply is stored at this location.  On average, 4,000 pounds of chlorine are stored in one ton cylinders.  In case of a chlorine leak, the City of Alexandria has an emergency response policy which requires City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 center.  Local fire and police departments are notified.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in evacuating citizens in the affected area.  \n\nThe worst case incident used EPA's RMP Comp(TM) model which projected the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine in ten minutes.  The affected area, 1.3 miles, included approximately 8000 citizens. Public facilities such as schools and recreational center are located in the potential affected area.  The alternative release model used EPA's RMP Guidance for WasteWater Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equation.  The model was based on 150 pounds/minute release affecting an area, 0.2 miles, with approximately 50 citizens potentially affected.   Currently, the City uses daily inspections and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  There are no active or passive mitigation being used at the facility at the present time.\n\nPlant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine stored in one ton cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.\n\nThe City of Alexandria has no history of reportable release for chlorine at this site.  There has been no injury or property loss associated with this chemical. \n\nThe City of Alexandria Broadway Site is included in witten community emergency response plan.  The facility does not have its own written emergency response plan.  The facility notifies the 911 Center"
