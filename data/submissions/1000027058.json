The refinery is situated along the east bank of the Mississippi River at mile marker 168. Convent Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, furnace oil, etc.) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane and butane, as well as flammable mixtures. \n\n\n\nOne of the by-products of petroleum refining is hydrogen sulfide, which is an EPA RMP listed toxic substance. Within the refinery, hydrogen sulfide is converted into elemental sulfur, which is a marketable product. Hydrogen sulfide is not stored in the refinery, and the quantity in any single process does not exceed the E"

However, the quantity of these substances in any process is also below the EPA RMP thresholds.\n\n\n\n3.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Convent Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulations are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n3.1    Employee Participation\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team or incident investigation team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the employee participation plan, entitled Standing Instruction 5.19 - Employee Participation that is maintained at the refinery. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.2    Process Safety Information\n\n \n\nConvent Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address the hazards of the chemicals in the processes, the technology of the processes, and the equipment used in the processes. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\nEmployees and contractors are informed of the location of process safety information that is relevant to their work.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards"

MSDSs are readily available through Convent Refinery's computer system. \n\nConvent Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical area classifications, piping and instrument diagrams (P&IDs), etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the processes are not compromised.  \n\n\n\n3.3    Process Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify reasonably foreseeable hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these potential hazards.\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA teams findings are entered into a computer data base and assigned to appropriate departments for resolution. \n\n\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original process hazard analysis, Convent Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are entered into a computer data base, assigned to appropriate departments for resolution. Final resolution of the findings is also documented in the data base.\n\n\n\n3.4    Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\n3.5    Training\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Convent Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator receives on the job training to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \n\n\n\nSkills are maintained through refresher training. The operating procedures are grouped into modules, and each operator is expected to review the assigned modules and pass the prescribed tests over a period of three years. Thus, refresher training is a continuing effort. All operator training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\n3.6    Contractors\n\n\n\nConvent Refinery uses contractors for routine maintenance activities, maintenance during shutdown periods, and for construction activities.

Monitor and Control will utilize the limits and targets generated by the Consolidate Limits and Targets work process as the starting point to develop and implement a monitoring process to track key targets. A comprehensive plan identifying the response required by the monitoring group (operations) is used if the monitored targets approach and or exceed the bound limits. The goal would be to move the monitoring of Convent's operating processes from a reactive approach (responding to alarms) to a more pro-active approach (monitor variable trends and take action prior to an alarm). The process envisions Convent having fewer alarms and Instrumented Protective Function (IPF) activation events over time. As a result of implementing this pr"
