Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.  However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Waco Fire Department and the McLennan County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThis facility is used for the production of Powerade, vitaminwater; and FUZE; sports beverages as well as Minute Maid; fruit juices and juice drinks.  Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The ammonia refrigeration system has been operational since December of 1998.  The system's purpose is to provide cold storage capabilities for certain products.  Due to the characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the USEPA's RMP*Comp Version 2.01, was used.  RMP*Comp is designed to model the atmospheric dispersion of ground-level area source dense gas clouds released with zero momentum into an atmospheric boundary layer over fla"

The inputs for the RMP*Comp model were determined using the assumptions and equations provided in EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (USEPA, 2004).\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario would involve the catastrophic failure of the low-pressure receiver.  The low-pressure receiver has a capacity of 43,443 pounds based on vessel dimensions; however, the maximum quantity stored in the receiver at any one time is physically limited to 13,117 pounds.  Based on this information a release quantity of the entire vessel (13,117 pounds) is assumed.   As specified in the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the worst case scenario assumes the release occurs over a period of 10 minutes, yielding a release rate of 725 pounds per minute.  The vessel is located inside the facility engine room, which has an overhead door; however, the release rate is considered unmitigated since the proximity of the storage vessel to the door prevents the use of the door as passive mitigation.  Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed) as required by the RMP rule, RMP*Comp yielded a distance of 1.0 mile to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) (\"zone of influence\").  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 5,521 based on US Census Bureau information from EPA's MARPLOT program.  Other public receptors identified within the zone of influence include schools and commercial/industrial areas.  No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\n\n\n\nSeveral alternative release scenarios were evaluated; however, when they were modeled none of them reached a toxic endpoint offsite.  For the purpose of this RMP submission, the following alternative release scenario was chosen because it is the most likely to occur that would potentially release a significant amount of ammonia.  The scenario chosen involves the failure of a 0.25 "

This scenario could also be representative of multiple situations such as a small hole in a vessel or pipe, a pinpoint hole in a condenser coil, or a packing leak around a valve stem.  Due to the presence of an alarm system and isolation valves and based on a recent release event, the release would occur over a 15 minute timeframe.  Under default weather conditions, RMP*Comp yielded a distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.1 miles.  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 0 based on US Census Bureau information from EPA's MARPLOT program.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  Our facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nAs part of the ammonia refrigeration system installation process, and as required under PSM, the facility conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with its ammonia refrigeration system are identified and controlled efficiently.  These studies, using \"What If\" scenarios, will be repeated every 5 years by a team of qualified personnel w"

These procedures address various modes of operation including startup, normal operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to all operators and contractors who work with the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are working with the ammonia refrigeration system are competent in all relevant operating procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments will conduct audits on a regular basis to ensure that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly implemented.  These audits will be carried out at least every three (3) years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits shall be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, an accidental release of ammonia.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions implemented to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All incident investigation reports will be retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments truly believes that accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn July 2011, an overpressurized relief valve on the chiller system released approximately 412 pounds.  The relief valve was determined to be in compliance.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola Refreshments Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with local emergency response agencies performing all rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification of the local emergency response agencies which are responsible for notifying the public.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\nThe McLennan County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated.  The Waco Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all facility emergencies, including ammonia releases.\n\n\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility has no currently planned changes to the ammonia refrigeration system, but will periodically assess opportunities to improve the safety of that system.\n\n"
