      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n1.1    Discussion\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared for the chlorine system at the Warren Wastewater Treatment Facility located in West Warren, Massachusetts.  This Plan has been developed in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68, A?Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.A?  The purpose of these provisions and this RMP is to prevent the accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause harm to the public and to the environment.\nThis RMP was originally developed by the Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant consultant, Tighe & Bond, Inc., specifically to prevent and mitigate accidental releases associated with the storage and handling operations at the West Warren facility.  The RMP provides a summary of the risk management program implemented at the Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant and was developed following the Environmental Protection AgencyA?s guidance documents for the regulated chemicals.  The RMP is available to government agencies and the public for review.\nTighe & Bond has performed the requisite review and regulatory update necessary for covered facilities on their five year RMP Submission Anniversary.  This April 29, 2009 review included:\nA?    A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the covered process using a methodology involving checklists developed from the EPA RMP Guidance, as well as a physical inspection of the covered process;\nA?    Performance of an off site consequence analysis (OCA) taking into account data revised from the year 2000 census; and\nA?    A general review of operating and maintenance procedures with facility operations and environmental personnel.\nThe following items provide an overview of the Warren Wastewater Treatment PlantA?s RMP in accordance with 40 CFR 68.155.\n\n1.2    Facility Description and Covered Process\nThe Town of Warren B.O.W.C. owns and operates the Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The chlorine is stored in a room equipped with ventilation and chlorine "

      "SummaryText": "alarms.  The chlorine gas is mixed with water in the chlorinators and is directly injected into the treatment locations.\nThe Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant currently stores up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine in eight one-ton containers.  Since the Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant stores more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine, the facility is required to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n1.3    Release Scenarios\nA worst case release scenario and two alternative release scenarios were performed and documented in the original RMP filing.  These scenarios were re-calculated for the five year anniversary updating population and receptor information.  Based on guidelines provided by the EPA in the 2004 RMP Submit Instruction Manual, release scenario information is not provided in this Executive Summary.\n\n1.4    Administrative and Engineering Controls\nThe Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant has implemented a prevention program (RMP Program 2) to administratively limit the potential for a worst case or alternative release.  No passive measures, however, were taken to minimize the impacts of these releases.  Specific measures employed in this program include safety reviews, hazard reviews, operating procedure reviews, training and maintenance and inspection.  These reviews are conducted, consistent with the operation of the covered process, once (1) every three (3) years in association with the Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant Compliance Audit (40 CFR 68.58) or with major changes.  The hazard review is required every five (5) years or with major changes.  Maintenance and inspection is conducted at specific intervals as outlined in the Warren Wastewater Treatment PlantA?s RMP.  The results of the most recent reviews are also maintained at the facility.\n\n1.5    Mitigation Measures\nCertain engineering controls are used to mitigate the potential effects of the alternative release scenarios and are listed in Section 8.4.e of the RMP submittal.\n\n1.6    General Accidental Prevention"
