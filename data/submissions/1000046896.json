No accidental release of ammonia has occurred since the installation of the ammonia freezing system in June of 1995.  \n\n\n\nOtto & Sons Process:\n\nOtto & Sons West Jordan is a producer of frozen meat products.  Otto & Sons West Jordan is a producer of value added meat products and uses a closed-loop ammonia freezing system to quick-freeze different meat products.  Otto & Sons has 32,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nNone\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nOtto & Sons West Jordan has a written program in compliance with OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management or PSM).  The PSM program outlines start-up and shutdown procedures for safe operation of the ammonia freezing system.  The PSM program procedures are followed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the freeing system.  The ammonia system was designed and built with multiple safety features and redundancy as added precaution.  Emergency procedures for shutdown and isolation of an ammonia leak are explained and practiced in the PSM program.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) is available for all employees.  PSI includes MSDS sheets, summary of physiological effects, ammonia affected areas and chemical inventory.  This information is readily available for all employees.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been completed for the ammonia system.  An outside consultant was hired to assist in the P"

Annual refresher training occurs for all employees.  Mechanics who operate the ammonia system receive training according to 29 CFR 1910.120 and annual refresher training.  \n\n\n\nContractors who work on the ammonia system are required to have the training according to 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\n\n\nPrestart-up review: A prestart-up review will be performed for any added equipment to the ammonia system.  This review will assure that all safety measures, equipment SOP training, and construction has been completed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity:  SOP procedures have been established to inspect and maintain the mechanical components on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan involves first responders trained to assist the fire department and HAZMAT teams.  It includes communication with Salt Lake County LEPC and local agencies regarding and accidental release.  The plant employees participate in annual evacuation drills in order to effect a rapid evacuation.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation:  An investigation team following the investigation procedure will review any incident or near misses.
