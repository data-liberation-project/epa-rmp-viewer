Guided by the Chevron OE process, the terminal has implemented a robust OSHA PSM program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment. Refer to Section 7 of this RMP submission for a detailed discussion of the terminal's OSHA PSM program.\r\n\r\n4) FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe butane blending did not have any RMP related accidents that meet the five-year accident history criteria .\r\n\r\n5) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the terminal is coordinated with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which are attended by local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the terminal provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances at the terminal.\r\n\r\n6) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe facility plans to implement safety improvements driven by the most recent PHA."

The facility includes a butane blending process consisting of a single 90,000-gallon pressurized horizontal bullet butane storage vessel. The facility already has existing pipeline, truck transfer and storage areas. \r\n\r\nChevron has a long-standing commitment to both worker and public safety, which is demonstrated by efforts set forth in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility and/or notify the necessary outside agencies.  \r\n\r\n2) FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe butane blending process at the terminal will consist of injecting butane into its gasoline prior to transferring gasoline to the storage tanks. The terminal will receive butane via tanker trucks and will store the butane in the 90,000-gallon pressurized horizontal butane storage vessel. The butane blending operation and associated butane storage render the terminal subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements. This operation renders the terminal subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR  \u00a71910.119. Furthermore, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program Level 3 requirements.   \r\n\r\n3) GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nChevron views the health and safety of its employees and the communities in which it operates as its top priority. On a global scale, Chevron has implemented its Operational Excellence (OE)"
