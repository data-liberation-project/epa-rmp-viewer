The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Rexford Grain Company are committed to the prevention of any\naccidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with\nthe local Fire Department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to\npeople and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n-The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers and chemicals for sale to farmers.\n\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application by our farmer customers for their crop\nproduction nutrients.\n\n-The maximum quantity stored would be 355500 pounds in our three storage tanks and  43 nurse tanks.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank car holding 150,000 pounds\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nA.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or tank car) released\nas a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 150,000 pounds, which represents the volume \nof a railcar storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion 22 ppm) is 1.13 miles.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a \nrelease from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental r"

The emergency response program.\n\n-This facility has:\nA. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\nB. Provided state and local authorities the emergency community right-to-know information as required under\nplanning aid SARA Title III (EPCRA)\nC. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\nplanning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations\nare performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no\nadditional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for \nimplementation at this time."
