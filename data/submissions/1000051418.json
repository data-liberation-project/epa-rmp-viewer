North Texas Oil & Gas is committed to safety and health of it's employees, contractors and visitors.  This commitment is demonstrated in the design, installation, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site specific preventative maintenance program is being developed and implemented.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Paint Creek Gas Facility is specifically designed to extract NGLs and condensate from an inlet raw natural gas gathering system.  The only process in the facility that contains an above threshold quantity of a regulated/flammable substance is the NGL Storage Tank.  There are no other above threshold quantity flammable/toxic substances at the Paint Creek Gas Facility.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Paint Creek Gas Facility has developed and implemented a site-specific accidental release prevention program that consists of a preventative maintenance program and employee training program.  The preventative maintenance program was developed under the guidelines of manufacturer written recommendations, recognized/generally accepted good engineering practices, industry/regulatory standards and past operation history.  Employee training was designed to ensure/document employee understanding of facility operation and maintenance requirements.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDNET HISTORY\n\nThe Paint Creek Gas Facility is a new facility and as such has had not accidental release that has resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Paint Creek Gas Facility "

The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of company employees and applicable emergency support services (ie:  contractors, fire departments, police departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, et.) that may be called upon for assistance.  Liaison with these agencies ensures a timely and proper response.  Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency is high priority.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Paint Creek Gas Facility believes safety is an issue than can always be improved upon, continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards.  The Paint Creek Gas Facility will endeavor to ensure company policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Employee understanding and compliance with these policies, programs and procedures is mandatory.\n\n"
