If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Butts County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.This facility is a propane dealership. We provide propane to industry to be used as a secondary fuel source, as well as to residences.  We are located in the center of Butts Counter in a rural area. We have two 30,000 gal., one 18,000 gal., and one 14,000 gal. propane tanks to service our customers.  Our tanks require Emergency Shut-off Valves (ESV), Relief Valves, and Pressure Relief Valves to operate safely. We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.  Our worstcase scenario is a failure of one 30,000 gallon propane storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed(88%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  There are 68 people living within a .4 mile radius of this location.  There  are no schools or hospitals within this distance and there are no environmental receptors.The alternative case scenario for our facility results in a .02 mile distance to the endpoint.  There are no people living within this distance."
