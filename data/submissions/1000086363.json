Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of all Americold facilities to conduct all operations in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Americold implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.  The facility is completely coordinated with the Region 1 LEPC and the Vernon Fire Department, who provide emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at 3420 East Vernon Ave, in Vernon, California.  The main business of Americold - Vernon Plant 2102 is cold storage.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility uses approximately 33,462 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within two separate closed systems (East and West).  There are 20,197 pounds of ammonia in the East system and 13,265 pounds of ammonia in the West system.  The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage, freezer storage, and dock areas. The facility consists of eleven main storage rooms and two engine rooms.  The two systems are not connected, but have a common a"

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. \n\n\n\nEngineering controls at the facility include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shutdown systems.  The majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine rooms and just outside of the engine rooms on the roof (condensers and high pressure receiver).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with many of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (March 2015 to March 2020) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or near misses that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Americold - Vernon Plant 2102 facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\n The operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the "

The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the Americold - Vernon Plant 2102 facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility has coordinated emergency response efforts with the fire department.  Operators at the facility are trained to respond to releases of ammonia; however a full team cannot be provided.  Americold has institutes a policy to respond to insignificant releases up to 200 ppm.  Above 200 ppm, the City of Vernon will be contacted. Americold operators are trained to assist the Fire Department once they arrive.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, performed on October 2017, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Americold - Vernon Plant 2103 facility located in Vernon, California.  The Americold - Vernon Plant 2102 safety committee is holding meetings as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These meetings include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
