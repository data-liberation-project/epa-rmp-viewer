A storage area for empty containers is provided outside the chlorination building.\n\nChlorine is a regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.  The chlorine threshold for triggering applicability of 40 CFR 68 is 2,500 pounds. The maximum quantity of chlorine stored on-site at any one time is 16,000 pounds.  Since this exceeds the threshold limit, the Fenton Plant is subject to 40 CFR 68 as a Program 2 facility.\n\n\n\nIV. WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nIV.1\tWorst-case Scenario \n\n \tFor the Fenton plant, the worst-case scenario is the loss of 2000 pounds of chlorine in ten minutes from a 1-ton container located outside the chlorination building.  Since the facility is located in a populated area, the worst-case scenario would affect nearby public receptors.\n\nIV.2\tAlternative Release Scenario \n\t\n\t\nThe alternative release scenario examined involves the release of chlorine due to a flashing liquid release through a 0.28 diameter rust hole at the liquid level of the 1-ton container. Passive mitigation is considered in this case, as the 1-ton container is assumed to be housed in the chlorination building. Since the facility is located in a populated area, the alternative scenario will affect nearby public receptors. \n \nV.\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all Federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The plant continually conducts inspections to ensure the system is intact and operating correctly.  These inspections ensure that the worst-case and alternative scenarios have a minimal chance of occurring.  \n\nThe plant has developed a prevention program for chlorine to meet the Program 2 requirements of the RMP rule.  The prevention program was developed to comply with 40 CFR 68, to ensure the safety of the employees, and to ensure the safety of the surrounding community.  The program cover"

There have been no releases at this facility as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).\n\nVII.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Fenton Plant is not a primary emergency responder in the event of an accidental but the plant will contact the City of Fenton fire department, the primary responder.  Procedures are in place for notification of the City of Fenton fire department (primary responder), the LEPC and the St. Louis County HAZMAT team.  The fire department is notified by calling 911.\n\nThe Fenton Plant has developed an emergency evacuation document.  The purpose of the document is to provide an orderly, effective plan of action for protecting employees in emergency situations when an evacuation is necessary.\n\n VIII.\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the what-if/checklist Hazard Review completed for chlorine, a list of action items was developed for implementation.  The following examples briefly describe improvements occurring as a result of the Hazard Review.\n\n1. Unsafe practices by Contractors will be reported to the Contractor's company.\n\n2. Installation of automatic shutoff valves that will close in response to the chlorine alarm.\n\n3. Flammable materials stored in the chlorine room will be removed.\n\n4. Develop operating procedures specific to this location."

The chlorine is used for filamentous growth control.  The Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68) classifies chlorine as a regulated toxic substance. It can cause a potential health hazard if not handled properly.  The Fenton Plant adheres to all applicable Federal, state, and local rules and regulations to ensure a safe environment within the plant as well as for the surrounding community.  Access to the chlorine systems is restricted to certified operators, authorized contractors, and the City of Fenton fire department (the primary responder in the event of an accidental release).\n\nThe Fenton Plant is a manned facility(manned 8 hrs/day - 7:00AM to 3:30 PM).  The Fenton Plant is not a primary emergency responder in the event of an accidental release.  Procedures are in place for notification of the Fenton fire department (primary responder), the LEPC and the St. Louis County HAZMAT team.\n\nIII.\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Fenton Plant in Fenton, Missouri is a wastewater treatment plant.  The plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68:  chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process for filamentous growth control.  The plant maintains the chlorination process year round.  The typical chlorine consumption rate is 200 - 400 lbs./day.  The North American Industrial Classification System code (NAICS code) for the primary process at this facility is 22132.  \n\nTypically, eight 1-ton containers of chlorine are stored on site at any given time. The on-line chlorination system includes four manifolded 1-ton containers in two sets of two with a manual switchover valve between the two sets.  All eight container"
