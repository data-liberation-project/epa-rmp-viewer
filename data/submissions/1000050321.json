      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) distributes drinking water to member water agencies throughout Southern California.  MWD provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by MWD in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the previous century.  MWD currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the F. E. Weymouth Water Treatment Plant (Weymouth Plant).\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  MWD regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, MWD has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Weymouth Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected against accidental releases by chlorine vapor scrubbers.\n\nWeymouth Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possib"

All applicable procedures of the State of California and EPA's RMP Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response.   The Weymouth Plant has an excellent safety record with chlorine use.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe MWD F. E. Weymouth Water Treatment Plant (Weymouth) is located at 700 North Moreno Avenue, in La Verne, California.  The plant is situated just east of Interstate Highway 210 and south of State Highway 30, covering approximately 140 acres.  The plant was built in 1940 to treat drinking water, including disinfection with chlorine.  It is currently designed to process 520 million gallons of water a day (520 mgd).  The facility currently stores and uses chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the RMPR and CalARP Pro"

Liquid chlorine is transferred by its own pressure from the on-line storage vessel to one or more evaporators in the corresponding evaporator room.\n\nEach evaporator uses an electrically heated water bath to vaporize the liquid chlorine.  The chlorinators regulate the flow of chlorine gas (under vacuum) through venturi eduction to the ejectors.  The ejectors are located at various points throughout the facility, and introduce chlorine (under vacuum) into service water to form a chlorine solution tha"

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator room, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing the online storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated locally and at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each chlorine storage vessel liquid angle valve connected to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.  Emergency showers and eye wash stations are also provided throughout the Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility, including the scrubber system.\n\nA packed-bed chlorine gas scrubber system, consisting of two parallel scrubber units, is provided to neutralize an accidental release of chlorine gas from either chlorine storage bay, evaporator room, or the chlorinator room.
