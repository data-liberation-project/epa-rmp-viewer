Personnel training is necessary to support a continual improvement in facility safety. CHESI's training plan achieves this goal. The training programs in place are documented in order to ensure that needed information about the safe handling of all chemicals present at the facility is available to employees, and can be readily interpreted by emergency response team staff and the Facility Emergency Coordinators when questions arise from public safety officials regarding potential risks to the community. All of these features of the RMP and the integrated risk management program at this site lead to operations that meet or exceed the state and federal regulatory requirements applicable to the facility's operations."

An emergency response plan has been developed which prescribes emergency procedures which the facility will implement in the event of a release or fire at the facility.\n\nCHESI's emergency response plan is identified as the facility Contingency Plan. The purpose of this plan is to describe both the hazards associated with the management of waste materials at the facility and the steps which will be taken to minimize the risk associated with each hazard. By ensuring that proper preventative measures are taken at all times and by providing for emergency response procedures to be followed in the event of any unexpected occurrence(s), CHESI intends to operate its facility in a manner that does not pose a significant threat to public health, safety, or welfare of the environment. CHESI's record in this regard has been exceptional and its overall contribution to the protection of human health and the environment far surpasses the risks associated with the type of activities performed at the facility.\n\nThe specific elements of CHESI's Contingency Plan include the following:\n\n\u00bf\tA general description of the facility operations and the types of hazardous wastes handled at the facility.\n\u00bf\tA list of the CHESI emergency coordinators who are responsible for overseeing implementation of the Contingency Plan, and their responsibilities.\n\u00bf\tCriteria for implementing the Contingency Plan.\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Procedures, including identification and assessment of an imminent or actual emergency, response procedures for facility personnel, and notification requirements.\n\u00bf\tA list of emergency equipment.\n\u00bf\tCoordination agreements between CHESI and local and state officials.\n\u00bf\tAn evacuation plan.\n\u00bf\tIncident notificat"
