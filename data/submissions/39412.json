Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no accidental release of chlorine in the last five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based upon altering personnel at the facility to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of the first responders at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated. Santa Cruz County - Environmental Health can incorporate this response into the Area Plan for the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are commitments made under the Process Hazard Analysis element of the Process Safety Management (PSM) and the RMP are being implemented at this time. Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as part of the PSM and RMP to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated chlorine process system. These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for the accidental releases of the regulated substance."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe City of Santa Cruz's Water Treatment Plant (WTP) located at 715 Graham Hill Road  uses chlorine which is considered a hazardous material and is a regulated substance, which is considered in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent human exposure, and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle chlorine; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of the pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe WTP is designed to disinfect the treated water to prevent the spread of bacteria and pathogenic organisms.  \n\nChlorine is delivered by a commercial supplier in one-ton containers for use at the WTP. Off-loading of the one-ton container from the commercial delivery vehicle is accomplished with a two-ton hoist.  The one-ton containers are placed in the chlorine storage area on a steel frame. One of the one-ton containers is on-line inside of a containment vessel, another one ton container is on stand-by inside of another containment vessel.  The delivery/pickup, storage, and handling of chlorine are considered a part of one complete process.\n\nThe treatment facility has administrative procedures in place to limit the amount of chlorine at the facility.  Delivery of chlorine one-ton containers is during normal working hours.  The driveway provides adequate room for the delivery and parking of the delivery vehicles during the off-loading of the full one-ton containers, and the loading of the empty one-ton containers. \n\nThe chlorine building is closed when not occupied.  No unauthorized personnel is allowed entry into the"

      "SummaryText": "chlorine building.  The container storage and handling is conducted pursuant to per Sections 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 of the Chlorine Institute's Chlorine Manual.\n\nThe WTP operates twenty four hours per day, seven day a week. The chlorine gas is withdrawn from the one-ton containers by vacuum. This vacuum is created by water passing through the injector nozzles.  This vacuum opens the vacuum regulator diaphragm, and withdraws the gas from the one-ton container at a controlled feed rate set by the chlorinator. The chlorine gas is injected into the water, where it becomes a chlorine/water solution and is feed where it is needed in the treatment process. The chlorine storage room and chlorinator room have a ventilation system, chlorine leak detectors, and alarm systems. The chlorinators are vented to the outside if the diaphragm malfunctions. WTP personnel are trained  to use self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA).\n\n3a. Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls exist  to restrict to a minimum, the amount of chlorine lost from a one-ton container if accidental release were to occur. This administrative control is inherent in the operational procedures for the chlorine process system and the training provided to the operators of the process system.\n\n3b. Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict the amount of chlorine released to a minimum if released were to occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the chlorine process and containment vessel systems; their related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the chlorine process system and the related activities and equ"
