The impact distance in both cases has been derived using the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document.

Both chemicals involve flammability risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  THE GENERAL CRYOVAC ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC \tPREVENTION STEPS:\r\n\r\n* E.A.T.

FIVE -YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORIES:\r\n \r\nThere has been three accidental releases over the past five years, all of which involved releases of less than one gallon.  There were no injuries, property damage or offsite consequences as a result of these incidents.  In place systems resulted in early detection and mitigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\n\r\nThe Cryovac Food Packaging Plant at Indianapolis has implemented an accidental release prevention policy, which integrates containment technologies, redundant safety systems, operational procedures, and management practices.  All Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.  The Cryovac Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans, which are detailed in the Emergency Operations Manual (EOM).  This includes a trained on site, around the clock Emergency Response Team, and procedures to notify the local fire authority.\r\n\r\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\r\n\r\nCryovac Food Packaging manufactures plastic foam packaging used in the food industry.  The plant uses pentane and isobutane as blowing agents to make plastic foam.  These are the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location.  Pentane (CAS 109-66-0) is a flammable aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to gasoline and isobutane (CAS 75-28-5) is a colorless, odorless flammable gas.  Pentane is used and stored as a liquid in a un-pressurized UST. Isobutane is used and stored in pressurized AST. The blowing agents are released (slowly out gassed) from the product during the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n3.  THE WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\n\t\r\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by EPA assumes a rail car delivery\tcontainer completely fails, all safety systems fail, worst-case weather conditions exist, the vapors find an ignition source and 10% of release explodes.  The endpoint is at 1 psi overpressure is .37 miles.  The alternative release scenario or more credible scenario is based on an analysis of potential hazards at our facility.  Maximum release is 2000 gallons form a breach of a railcar or catastrophic failure of the delivery piping.  The impact distance is based on maximum distance at which the radiant heat effects"

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\n\r\nA number of changes to improve safety and reduce risks have been implemented that were identified in the HAZOP review of PSM in 2014.  Safety is an ongoing process and the highest priority at Cryovac facilities.  The monthly Management Safety Committee meeting provides safety items are first on the agenda of the daily production meeting and overall direction, control, and follow up."
