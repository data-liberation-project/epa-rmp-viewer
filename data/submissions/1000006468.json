There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year period. \n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\no\tWritten site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\no\t Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no\t Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\no\tChlorine system maintenance procedures \n\no\tTraining on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\no\tConducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\n\no\tDeveloping an initial Emergency Response Plan \n\no\tTraining in support of the certification of operators\n          \nThe plant superintendent and the company safety managers annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. Recent activities include RMP Self-Audits in late 2007 and RMP training in May 2009. \n          \nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals.    \n                                                                                                             \n\u00c2\u00bfX\tA full vacuum chlorine delivery system has been installed at the wastewater plant several years ago. The vacuum process greatly reduces leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine. \n\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tPlant inventories are being controlled to maintain less than six chlorine"

      "SummaryText": "cylinders on site.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. In 1998, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a professional organization to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to notify businesses or residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are routinely conducted.\n\nIn addition to the Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. United Water has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tHazard Communications\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tPersonal Protective Equipment\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tLockout/Tagged\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tConfined Space\n \nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record with no recordable injuries over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have been no reportable chlorine releases in the last five years.  The plant has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program.            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Report by:\n\nGary Stainback                                                               \nDirector of Operations\nUnited Water"
