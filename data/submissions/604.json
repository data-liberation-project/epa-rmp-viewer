If an accidntal release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the releases to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the anhydrous plant, is to recieve by truck anhydrous ammonia, store the ammonia and transfer the ammonia into nurse tanks which will be used by our customers to enhance the growing of agricultural commodities such has wheat. The maximum quantity stored would be 175,000 pounds  in our 3 storage tanks. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released has a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quanity released would be 79,000 pounds  which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity  as limited by designed standards. The distance to the endpoint in the worst case scenario ( point of dispersoin to 200 ppm) is 1.89 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history or the most likely potential  incident is a relaeas from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm)  is .83 miles.\n\nOur facility is heavily regualted by both the Federal Goverment and the State of Kansas. OSHA, EPA, DOT  and  the Kansas Department of Agriculture all regulate our facilities and we our best to satisfy not only these regulators but also meet industry standards and our own high standards. We have 9 volunteer fire men that work at our facilities and we are proud of the training our employees have had. Our efforts go beyond the typical training required for agricultural facilities because of the volunteer commitments our employees have made. All of these efforts have paid dividends to our firm . We have had no off sight or on sight accidents in the last 5 years. Th"
