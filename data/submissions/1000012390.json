(Radian) to assist in addressing the requirements under the federal Risk Management Program as mandated in the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r )(7).  The Risk Management Program rules requires covered facilities to conduct a hazard assessment, develop a prevention and emergency response program, and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) by June 21, 1999.  Sterigenics completed an update of the orginal RMP plan by means of using the USEPA software, RMPe*Submit.  A copy of the submittal is included in Section 9.0 of this document.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nFacilities that use or store more than 10,000 lbs. of ethylene oxide are required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the US EPA.  The RMP consists of several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\n\n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\n\nA?A? Introduction;\n\nA?A? Facility identification and regulated substances;\n\nA?A? Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\nA?A? Hazard Assessment;\n\nA?A? Prevention Program;\n\nA?A? Five-Year Accident History;\n\nA?A? Emergency Response Plan; and\n\nA?A? Planned Changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nSterigenics operates a contract sterilization facility located in Willowbrook.  The facility is engaged in the sterilization of medical equipment and spices using ethylene oxide.  Ethylene oxide is listed as a regulated toxic substance under U.S. EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR 68). \n\n\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Sterigenics.

Sterigenics is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program \n\n\n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the US EPA Risk Management Program Level 3 requirements (40 CFR 68). The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\nA?A? Process safety information accessible to employees at all times.\n\nA?A? A hazard review was conducted as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\n\nA?A? Computerized process controls prevent unsafe conditions in the sterilizers.\n\nA?A? Door interlock system.\n\nA?A? Written operating procedures are used for training and guiding the work of operators.\n\nA?A? Training is provided to all employees that operate the system.\n\nA?A? A program is in place to properly maintain the system and equipment.\n\nA?A? Incidents are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort.\n\nA?A? Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed.\n\nA?A? A thorough Preventative Maintenance program helps ensure equipment is in proper working condition.\n\n\n\nThe sterilization process subject to the Risk Management Program at the Sterigenics US LLC - Willowbrook facility is designed with extensive safeguards to protect against the accidental release of ethylene oxide. Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection and alarm systems, electronic interlock safety systems for sterilization chambers, door interlock system, and explosion proof electrical systems.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process, and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.

These scenarios are included within Section 3 (Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequences Analysis). \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOnly accidents occurring in the past five years meeting the following requirements must be included:\n\nA?A? The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\n\nA?A? The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\nA?A? On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or\n\nA?A? Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nSterigenics US LLC- Willowbrook has had one accidental release from the ethylene oxide process within the last five years that meet this definition.

This reportable release resulted from an emission control scrubber breakdown on October 20th but the released excess emissions were not discovered until about 1:23 pm October 21, 2013.  Upon discovery of the excess emissions, the reportable release was immediately reported to the following agencies:\n\n? Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) to Paul Kattner (Case # H20131147),\n\n? Du Page County Emergency Response office, and \n\n?

An estimated 11.9 pounds of EO was released and the reportable quantity is 10 pounds. \n\n\n\n3.)The release from sterilization Chamber B was to atmosphere through the emission stack of the facility's acid scrubber emission control system, which is located about 25 feet above grade. Because of the lengthy release period through an elevated scrubber stack, there are no anticipated adverse health impacts to employees or the general public as a result of this incident. \n\n\n\n4.) The release was caused by failure of an interlock control to prevent process emissions from being routed to the emission control system when it was not functioning properly.  Upon discovering the release of the EO excess emissions from this failed interlock on Chamber B, the facility ceased processing in Chamber B and initiated an immediate investigation into why the interlock failed to prevent these excess emissions.  Chamber B was not restarted until the interlock system was repaired and tested with a documented protocol to confirm its proper operation.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions be coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).
