As a new company, formed as a result of a divestiture from Dow Chemical, we have a long history of excellent safety performance. Our commitment to maintain that performance is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Should a release occur, we would rely on the highly trained emergency response personnel onsite to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with City of Midland Fire Department, which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nB.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacturing of specialty chemicals and plastics.  We are wholly contained within The Dow Chemical Company Midland, Michigan Operations Site.  We have 3 regulated substances and 2 covered processes present at our facility.  These substances are listed in Table 1 below.\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Regulated chemical substances at Trinseo, LLC, Michigan Operations Site.\n\n\n\nMaterial\n\nAcrylonitrile\n\nAmmonia solution (>20% concentration)\n\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\n\n\n\nC.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable company and governing agency requirements of the time of construction.
