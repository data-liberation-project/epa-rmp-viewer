This release has off-site impact.  The distance to toxic endpoint is 1.9 miles as calculated using the EPA OCA Guidance document.  Written operating procedures prevent more than 25,000 lbs from being present in the 50,000 lb. Tank.  Corrosion monitoring of the vessel, careful control of changes to the process, and routine safety inspections make this worst case release scenario unlikely.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves the failure of a process line component.  The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.85 miles as calculated using the EPA OCA Guidance document.\n\nAn alternative release scenario for the chemical acrylonitrile involves the failure of a flange in a process line at the acrylonitrile storage tank.  This release has off-site impact. A concrete dike around the tank limits the exposed surface area of a pool and thus reduces the release rate.   The distance to toxic endpoint is 0.36 miles as calculated using the EPA OCA Guidance document.\n\nFlammable Scenarios\n\nThe worst case flammable release scenario for the Houston plant involves a release of 1,100,000 lbs of butadiene from a storage vessel.  This release has off-site impact.  The distance to endpoint is 0.83 miles as calculated using the EPA OCA Guidance document.  Corrosion monitoring of the vessel, leak detection devices, careful control of changes to the process, and routine safety inspections make this worst case release scenario unlikely.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for butadiene involves the failure of a process line.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nChemical Safety Policy\n\nManagement at The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Houston Chemical Plant is committed to a policy of providing and maintaining a safe and healthy environment for our employees and surrounding communities and neighbors.  The Houston Chemical Plant's Accidental Release Prevention programs prevent accidents at each stage of plant operation.  New or expanded facilities are built to current engineering standards, and hazard reviews are conducted on all chemical processes.  Process workers are trained and certified in detailed operating procedures.  Equipment is regularly inspected to standards, and is an integral part of the preventive maintenance system.\n\nCoordinated emergency response actions between the Houston Chemical Plant and local emergency officials are planned and practiced.  By working together, the emergency response teams are prepared to take the necessary measures to protect the public if an incident occurs.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Goodyear Houston Chemical Plant was built in 1943 by the U.S. government to produce synthetic rubber.  After World War II, The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company purchased the Houston plant from the government, and has since expanded and modernized the facility.\n\nSynthetic rubber manufactured at the facility is called Plioflex rubber. To produce it, two petrochemicals, butadiene and styrene are reacted with several chemical agents in a soap and water solution.  The reaction of butadiene and styrene to produce rubber gives off heat, and the temperature of reaction is controlled by the coolant anhydrous ammonia.\n\nAnother synthetic rubber made at this facility is called Chemigum, and is produced by the reaction of butadiene and acrylonitrile.  The Chemigum reaction gives off heat that is cooled using anhydrous ammonia.\n\nButadiene is a flammable substance that is stored under pressure in sufficient quantity to be regulated.  Anhydrous ammonia and acrylonitrile are toxic substances that a"
