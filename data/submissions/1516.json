      "SummaryText": "The Town of Leesburg's Kenneth B. Rollins Memorial Water Filtration Plant currently uses gaseous chlorine for disinfection of water as [art of the treatment process to produce potable water.  Chlorine is delivered to the site in 1-ton containers, which are stored on a covered dock until being brought into the chlorine scale room, where two containers are stored on a scale.  Two containers are hooked up, but administrative procedures limit containers in use to one.  The gas piping from each cylinder is routed to a vacuum regulator, which controls the gas feed.  Gas chlorinators with an eductor are used to inject the chlorine gas under vacuum into a water solution for application.\n\nThe Town has a Process Safety Management Plan, an Employee Health and Safety Plan, a Respiratory Protection Prgram, Hazard Communication Program, Drug and Alcohol Program, Fire Safety Program, Building Safety Program, Mechanical Safety Program, and other measures to address the safety of the gaseous chlorine process.  Employee and contractor training is conducted and documented as part of this plan.\n\nThe Town's Emergency Response program requires the plant operators to determine the severity of a potential chlorine leak and take appropriate action.  In the case of a minor leak, Town staff will operate shutoff valves or repair small leaking connections.  The Town will rely on Loudoun County Fire and Rescue in the case of a catastrophic release, and has a written procedure to dial 911, ensure that everyone is out of the building, and await emergency response.  Annual coordination with and inspections by Joe Sullivan, the Loudoun County Fire Marshall, are conducted.  Chlorine B kits have been provided to Loudoun County Fire and Rescue for use.  \n\nThe Town has installed numerous safety measures and administrative procedures to minimize the likelihood of accidental release, such as chlorine gas detectors in the storage room and a windsock on the plant site.  The Town has had no chlorine release"
