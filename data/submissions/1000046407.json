The facility consists of a processing plant used for manufacturing, storage, and freezing of bakery products.  The facility maintains approximately 425 full time employees.\n\n\n\nProtecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment is our top priority.  One component of these efforts is the risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68 and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.\n\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action (?68.155(a) and ?2745.3(a)):\n\n\n\nProtecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, and of the surrounding environment, is our top priority, and we have a comprehensive program in place to reduce risks associated with our process.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment and Reduction - We regularly assess the risks associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia in our manufacturing processes and seek out ways in which to reduce those risks.\n\n\n\nAccident Prevention - We engineer and construct our manufacturing processes and equipment to minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases.  We also provide our employees with extensive training in the safe operation of those processes and equipment.\n\n\n\nEmergency Action - We have developed an OSHA hazardous substance Emergency Action Plan.  This plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Lodi Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment.  The Lodi Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.

Prevention Program (?68.155(d) and ?2745.3(c)):\n\n\n\nWe have developed and implemented a prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  For our facility, the prevention program requirements for the EPA's RMP rule and CalARP regulations are nearly identical to the PSM rule.  The following section briefly describes the 12 elements of our prevention program:\n\n\n\na) Process Safety Information - We maintain a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan, to help ensure that employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with our facility.  These documents address (1) physical properties of anhydrous ammonia, (2) operating parameters for our equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration for our equipment.  We ensure that this process safety information is available to all our employees.\n\n\n\nb) Process Hazard Analysis - We perform and periodically update process hazard analysis (PHAs) for our covered process to help identify process hazards and make recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.

      "SummaryText": " A multidisciplinary team is assembled to analyze the hazards of our process.  This team includes personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with PHA experience.  The team systematically addresses the hazards associated with operation of the equipment in the covered process.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility for resolving the recommendations is assigned to plant personnel, and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.  The analysis is revisited at least every 5 years to ensure it is current.\n\n\n\nc) Operating Procedures - Our operators and managers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safety performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and in the unlikely event of a process upset.  Operating procedures include: (1) steps for safely conducting activities, (2) applicable process safety information, such as operating limits and consequences of process deviations, and (3) safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs.\n\n\n\nd) Training - We train workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  Our training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  On-the-Job Training and Evaluation is used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can begin or resume work on the system.\n\n\n\ne) Mechanical Integrity - We maintain our process equipment "

Our mechanical integrity (preventive maintenance) program includes (1) inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deficiencies and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the strict design standards required for service in our process.\n\n\n\nf) Management of Change - We evaluate and specifically approve all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, technology, and procedures to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  All changes other than replacement-in-kind must be approved through the full management of change program.  This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\n\ng) Pre-Startup Review - We recognize that new or newly modified processes are more likely to be involved in accidental releases.  Therefore, we perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation.  This review confirms that: (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications, (2) adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, (3) employee training has been completed, and (4) a PHA has been performed (if required) if the process is new or management of change requirements have been completed if an existing process has been modified.\n\n\n\nh) Compliance Audit - One of the cornerstones of an effective prevention program is a regular, thorough assessment.

We train our employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.
