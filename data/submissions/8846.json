      "SummaryText": "The Mt. Vernon Wastewater Treatment Facility is located at 105 East Perkins. The safety of the facility employees and the community is our number one priority.During normal flow conditions two chlorine cylinders are stored on site. One cylinder is connected to the automated chlorine feed system. The second cylinder is a back up. The vacuum regulator is attached to the chlorine cylinder. Water flowing through the ejectors creates a vacuum that opens the inlet valve to allow chlorine into the regulator. Chlorine passes through the flowmeter and chloromatic valve. An effluent flow meter sends a 4-20mA  signal to the chloromatic control valve that controls the feed rate. Chlorine is feed to the ejector. If water supply to the ejector is stoped or the operating vacuum is lost for any other reason, the gas inlet valve closes to isolate the chlorinator  from the cylinder. Any chlorine, which might enter the regulator is vented from the system through a pressure relief valve. A chlorine detector monitors the chlorine storage and feed areas. The alarm provides audible and visual alarms. If the alarm is activated the auto dialer will call the operator on call first and then call all plant personel until the alarm is acknowledged. At this time the Emergency response Plan for chlorine leaks will be followed.The proper protective and repair equipment are maintained on site and at the fire department. All employees and firemen are trained in the appropriate safety procedures outlined in the chlorine manuals. The fire department has agreed to assist with the evacuation, safety of employees and community, chemical control, and emergency repairs.   \n\nThere has not been an accidental release of chlorine from a covered process in the past five years. \n\nEMC and the City of Mt. Vernon  have developed this Risk Management Program (RMP) to comply with the Clean Air Act Part 112R. The RMP contains two scenarois, a worst case and an alernative. The worst cast scenario is the release of an e"
