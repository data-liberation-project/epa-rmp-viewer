      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nEllwood National Crankshaft Company (ENC) operates a portion of a fully integrated manufacturer of specialty forged steel products, owned by the Ellwood Group, Inc. in Irvine, PA. Currently, the facility's core products are crankshafts used in larger diesel engines and pipe molds used as expendable tooling in the production of iron pipe for water transmission. The balance of production consists of other heavy industrial products that involve precision machining or proprietary boring/coring techniques.\r\n\r\nThe site is located on a single contiguous site with Ellwood National Forge (ENF) and Ellwood National Steel (ENS). The ENC/ENF/ENS site encompasses approximately 300 acres with 46 acres of developed property and 578,000 square feet under roof. The combined plant operations employ approximately 575 total personnel in manufacturing and administrative positions. The plant operates 24/7 throughout the year. The maximum number of employees on-site at any one time is approximately 287 during the first, or daylight, shift.\r\n\r\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE\r\n\r\nEmployee and community health and safety and environmental protection are priorities of ENC/ENF/ENS and its management. ENC/ENF/ENS employs at least two full time health and safety professionals and retains other consultants and professionals as needed to provide supplemental services. Other staff are also involved in health and safety affairs on a part-time basis. The management and employees of ENC/ENF/ENS take pride in being ISO 9002 certified and the combined ENC/ENF/ENS facility is the recipient of multiple safety and environmental awards.\r\n\r\n2.

      "SummaryText": "tance  - anhydrous ammonia - is stored and utilized in the nitriding/surface hardening department of ENC. Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic and buoyant gas with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. In the nitriding department, crankshaft wear surfaces (bearing/throws) are heated in a nitrogen environment and nitrogen is absorbed in unmasked steel surfaces causing a case hardening to a prescribed depth based on temperature and exposure duration. Anhydrous ammonia is used as both the carrier gas for and the source of the nitrogen used in this process. The ammonia is thermally separated into elemental nitrogen and hydrogen and fed to the furnace to establish the inert nitrogen environment. Periodically, during the nitriding cycle, hydrogen and some nitrogen is sent to an exhaust gas neutralizer before being vented to the atmosphere.   \r\n\r\nC. QUANTITIES HANDLED OR STORED\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported and stored under pressure to maintain the ammonia in liquid form (under a vapor head space).  The ammonia is stored in a single 18,000 gallon horizontal, welded, steel, ASME certified, pressure tank. Administrative controls and operating procedures limit the maximum volume stored on site at any time to 15,300 gallons (approximately 78,000lbs).\r\n\r\n3. WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nThe ammonia release scenarios considered in the ENC RMP are consistent with the USEPA 2004 General Guidance Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR Part 68). \r\n\r\n4. DISTANCES TO ENDPOINT\r\n\r\nFor both worst case and alternative release scenarios, RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distances to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm). Both model scenarios were considered as releases in urban areas, utilized the default atmospheric stability factors/wind speeds, and resulted in offsite impacts. Passive mitigation-release in an enclosure/building is applicable in either scenario but was not used in the alternative release case. Active mitig"

      "SummaryText": "ation available at the site includes water sprinklers to absorb released ammonia and detectors/alarms/operator attention to contain/control a release. However, no active mitigation was utilized in either scenario. \r\n\r\nThe RMP*Comp calculated distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst case scenario is 2.3 miles, affecting an estimated population of 2,100, as well as schools, recreation areas, and the Allegheny National Forest. This distance represents the maximum downwind distance that the catastrophic release (under worst case weather conditions) could pose a hazard to the public. For the alternative release scenario, the maximum calculated distance to the endpoint using the RMP*Comp model is 0.1 miles, which would not affect any residential population as well as the Allegheny National Forest. \r\n\r\n5. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nENC operation and safety plans, policies, and prevention procedures as well as planned maintenance (overall management) have been established to minimize the potential for an accidental or catastrophic ammonia release. The storage tank is equipped with a high pressure, magnetically coupled sight gage that allows accurate tank volume measurement. In addition, the ammonia ordering policy minimizes the potential for overfill, and unloading management procedures, which require one ENC employee and the ammonia delivery driver to minimize the potential for a release during a delivery.\r\n\r\n6. 5-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn June 16th, 2016 ENC lost power to a combustion source (neutralizer) for 14 hours and 40 minutes. The exhaust neutralzier was not operating at the correct temperature to burn off all emissions. This resulted in a release of 139.7lbs. of ammonia. \r\n\r\n7. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nENC has prepared and implemented a written Safety Procedure (plant document ENC-OG-SAF-029) entitled, Ammonia Emergency Response Plan, effective dated April 8, 2008.

ENC has also prepared and implemented additional plant-wide policies/plans (e.g. a hot work permit program, confined space entry program, etc.) and a Contractor Safety Program as part of the internal Continuous Plant Safety Awareness and Improvement Program.\r\n\r\nThe site response plan is registered with the Warren County LEPC and is periodically implemented as a full-scale onsite drill. Multiple trained emergency response personnel are employed at ENC. On an annual basis, the emergency response team receives refresher training and recertification by independent outside auditors.\r\n\r\n8.
