This facility is located at 725 State Road in Ashtabula.  At this facility, GabePro manufactures a variety of specialty organic chemicals.  The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs 72 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (? 68.155(a)):\n\nGabePro is committed to operating the Ashtabula Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, GabePro has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Ashtabula Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Ashtabula Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the Ashtabula Plant consists of the following three elements:\n \n* A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n \n* A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes)\n\n* An emergency response program to help respond"

In fact, the Ashtabula Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nGabePro?s policy on the use of hazardous substances:  Before using a hazardous substance at the Ashtabula Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, GabePro reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance, which could adversely, affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility?s Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes that handle hazardous materials.\n\nGabePro strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  GabePro implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Ashtabula Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, GabePro requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. GabePro?s"

GabePro utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation.  GabePro trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, GabePro works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  GabePro has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Ashtabula County, Community Awareness and Emergency Response Plan (AC-CAER).\n\nAshtabula Plant?s emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, Ohio and EPA regulations.  This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Ashtabula Plant.  If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Ashtabula County-CAER Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\n\nGabePro is an active participant in the community:  GabePro is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness.  In addition, the Ashtabula Plant demonstrates community commitment by providing involvement and leadership in important local organizations such as the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the Ashtabula River Partnership (ARP).

The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario \" and an \"alternative release scenario.\"  In reality, however, GabePro does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  \n\nRMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used for evaluating the distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences.

RMP*Comp Version 1.07 were used for alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences.  Assuming a wind speed of 3 meters/sec, a D stability class and urban topography, the epichlorohydrin cloud would travel 0.1 miles before reaching an epichlorohydrin concentration of below 0.076 ppm (which is the endpoint Emergency Response Planning Guideline value established in the RMP rule).
