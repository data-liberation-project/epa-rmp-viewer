The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes,\r\nammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.\r\n\r\nThis Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\n1.\tOn April of 2013 - The site constructed an entire separate process (Engine Room 1) containing 32,500 lbs. of the regulated substances Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n2.\tOn April of 2016 - The System was expanding by adding separate process (Engine Room 2) containing 32,500 lbs. of the regulated substances Anhydrous Ammonia.\r\n3.\tThe combination of both Engine Rooms (ER-1 & ER-2) totals 65,000 lbs. of NH3.\r\n\r\nThe Americold, Savannah Pooler facility chills and stores a variety of food products in their cold storage warehouse. The refrigeration process, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms.

      "SummaryText": "ges in pressures are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 6\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (CAS #7664-41-7) is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration process. The total ammonia inventory is above the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release Prevention.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\r\n\u00bf\tWorst Case Release Result Summary\r\n\u00bf\tAlternative Release Result Summary\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards including the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 1-2017 American National Standard for Definitions and Terminology Used in IIAR Standards\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 2-2014 Addendum A (2019) American National Standard for Safe Design of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration System\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 3-2017 American National Standard for Ammonia Refrigeration Valves\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 4-2015 American National Standard for Installation of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 5-2019 American National Standard for Startup of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 6-2019 American National Standard for Inspecting, Testing, and Maintenance of Safe Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 7-2019 American National Standard for Developing Operating Procedures for Closed-Circuit Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\r\n\u00bf\tANSI/IIAR Standard 8-2015 American National Standard for Decommissioning of"

The facility has personnel that are trained to First Responder Operations Level on an annual basis, all are fit tested and respiratory trained annually.\r\nDuring the RMP Development Review, it was recommended that the facility conduct annual evacuation drills to ensure all employees understand the emergency response procedures. In addition, it was recommended\r\nthat the facility contacts the local Fire Department regarding participation in the evacuation drills.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nDuring the Review of the Process Safety Management program at this facility, the Process Hazard Analysis study generated mitigation measures that would improve safety at the Americold, Americold, Savannah Pooler facility located at 220 Nordic Way, Pooler 31322. These action items were entered into APSM which generates a tracking document that provides reminder communications via e-mails if the recommendation(s) are open pass its due date.\r\n\r\nOn an annual basis the technicians at the site complete annual visual inspections of each major piece of equipment. All gaps are documented in APSM which generates a tracking document that provides reminder communications via e-mails if the recommendation(s) are open pass its due date.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the annual visual inspections the site utilizes a third party to perform the 5-year comprehensive Mechanical Integrity Inspection and a Non Destructive test to determine the condition of the insulation and the quantity of wall loss for selected pipe locations and vessels. The recommendations from this major Inspection are loaded to APSM which generates a tracking document that provides reminder communications via e-mails if the recommendation(s) are o"
