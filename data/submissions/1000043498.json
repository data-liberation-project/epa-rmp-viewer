      "SummaryText": "Chattem Chemicals, Inc. stores and uses ammonia on site at the Chattanooga, Tennessee facility as a chemical feedstock in quantities that exceed the threshold quantity for ammonia as defined by the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.  Chattem Chemicals, Inc. has developed and implemented a accidental release prevention program under the RMP program that addresses the hazards associated with the process and implements procedures which minimize the possibility and severity of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nChattem Chemicals has not had an ammonia accident in the fifteen years the RMP program has been in effect that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.  An OSHA Process Safety Management Program is currently maintained for the ammonia process in conjunction with the RMP program.  \n\n\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the unlikely failure of the ammonia storage tank during a time in which the maximum amount of ammonia is stored in it.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within distance of the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pipe leak.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the ammonia process, it is our policy to notify the Chattanooga Fire Department and the Hamilton County LEPC.  There are no planned safety changes to the process at the current time."
