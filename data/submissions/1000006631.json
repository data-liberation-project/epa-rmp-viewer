Refrigeration employees and contractors are required to achieve proficiency of all safe work practices to work on or near the process.  \n\nThis facility is a public refrigerated warehouse that provides refrigerated storage and distribution services to producers and manufacturers of food products.  The facility operates the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system and provides employee ammonia awareness training experience for everyone working around the warehouse environment.\n\nFive Year accident History- In the past five years their has been a reportable ammonia release. Release involved small bore tubing on a compressor capacity control.\n\nThis facility is subject to EPCRA Tier II reporting requirements and has submitted tier II reports annually in a timely manner.  This reporting provides local public safety officials with facility chemical use and storage, and facility contact information for emergency response.  \n\nHazmat training is provided for refrigeration personnel and employees with key rolls during emergency situations. This training is enhancing the confidence as Hazmat technicians and Incident command level support can work together with in the public safety sector.. Training to this level is in place to support local authorities with ammonia response specialists in an effort to coordinate response plans for the facility.
