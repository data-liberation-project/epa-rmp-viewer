      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Company has established a comprehensive Process Safety\nManagement Program incorporating policies, procedures and\ntraining which will provide for the safe handling of chlorine. \nProcedures provide for a \"Fail Safe\" mode of operation, where the\nchlorine transfer lines are tested every time they are connected\nand before transfer begins,  This is a daily activity.\n\nThe company's service for residential swimming pools includes the\ndisinfection of pool water with chlorine gas.  Chlorine gas\ntreatment of pools has proven to be the most effective method of\ndisinfection as well as providing the highest water clarity.  IT\nis not only the preferred treatment by most pool owners, but\nprovides for a better general state of public health related to \nresidential pools.\n\n\n\n     Process Description:\n\nChlorine is received in one-ton shipping and storage containers\nwhich are provided by the manufacturer.  One-ton containers have\nbeen in use for well over 50 years;  the design and maintenance\nof these containers has proven to be highly reliable and safe for\ntransporting and storing chlorine.  They are also designed for\nrugged transportation and are virtually indestructible.  Special\nemergency repair kits are kept an hand to stop a leak from any\npoint of the container, whether it be the valve , fusible safety\nplugs, or on the container itself.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is to transfer chlorine form\nthe one-ton container into a number of small cylinders which hold\n20 pounds of chlorine.  It is these smaller cylinders which are\ncarried to the pool site for use.\n\nThe filling system is equipped with a vent system to absorb any\nresidual chlorine from the transfer lines after filling is\ncomplete.  There is essentially no chlorine released to the\natmosphere during or after this operation.  Once again, note that\nall lines are leak tested prior to chlorine transfer; this is a\ndaily event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Emergency Response Plan:\n\nThe facility maintains a writ"

Prevention is a major part of the\ncompany's operating policy, and to insure an emergency doesn't\noccur, the storage and transfer area are located in a separate\nprotected area, extensive daily leak checks are performed before\nany transfer takes place, and equipment is inspected and tested\nregularly, and replaced as needed as part of a preventive\nmaintenance program.  A comprehensive training program is also\ndesigned to insure only trained and qualified personnel handle\nchlorine.\n\n\n\n     Emergency Response Program:\n\nThe Emergency Response Program provides for coordination with\noutside emergency response agencies.  Primary response will be\nperformed by trained emergency response personnel.  Training\nand/or drills are conducted periodically.  The plan also provides\nfor procedures to notify the public if needed during an\nemergency. \n\n\n\n     Five Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidents, releases, or incidents involving\nchlorine at the facility during the past five years, or prior to\nthat. \n\n\n\n     Worst Case Scenarios:\n\nTwo worst case scenarios were evaluated to determine the\npotential off site impact from a release of chlorine.  The first\nscenario, which is specified by the guidelines calls for the\nrelease of the entire contents of the largest container within a\nten minute period.  This also must be evaluated for the absolute\nworst case weather conditions.  That is during a calm night when\nthe highest off site concentrations would occur.  This scenario\nshows a potential adverse impact up to 4.5 miles from the source. \nThe same release occurring during the worst day time conditions\nwould have a potential effect up to 2.5 miles from the source.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Alternate Worst Case Scenario:\n\nA more realistic alternate worst case scenario was evaluated, and\nshowed a potential adverse impact for a distance of 600 yards. \nThis scenario is "
