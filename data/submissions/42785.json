      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThis facility complies with applicable International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) standards and it is our policy to adhere to applicable federal,state, and local laws. This facility has mechanisms in-place as identified in the Process Safety Management Manual on the refrigeration system to address small releases of ammonia. If an emergency release were to occur (i.e. A reportable amount), it is our policy to notify applicable agencies and request that they respond to the emergency. The Hanover foods facility is included in the Caroline County Emergency Operations Plan. Procedures are contained therein for response to an emergency involing the ammonia refrigeration sysyems by non-facility personnel.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThis facility is a raw vegetable processing facility. The facility receives, processes, packages, and freezes raw vegetables for shipping to other destinations. We use ammonia as a refrigerant in five (5) ammonia systems to provide refrigeration capacity to process equipment including coolers, freezers, evaporator units, and water chillers. The systems are identified as Flo Freezer #1, Flo Freezer #2, Cold Storage #2 and #3, Cold Storage #4, and Country Fresh. Flo Freezer #1 and #2 are interconnected and have a combined ammonia capacity of 13,772 pounds of ammonia. Cold storage #2 and #3 have capacity of 6,671 pounds of ammonia and Cold Storage #4 has total of 4,004 pounds of ammonia. The Country Fresh capacity is included with Flo Freezer #1 and #2. Thus total capacity of the plant is 24,447 pounds of ammonia.\n\nThe worst case and alternative case release scenarios:\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the failure of a pipe or vessel in the Flo Freezer Systems #1 and #2 when they are operating with their combined maximum intended inventory of 13,772 pounds, resuting in its complete release to the environment over a period of 10 minut"

      "SummaryText": "es. The resulting distance to a 200ppm ammonia toxic endpoint is .7 miles and public receptors are within the distance to endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a 1/4\" effective diameter orfice leak (representative of a pump seal leak or gasket rupture) leading to an airborne release. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends for .3 miles.\n\nThe general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia refrigeration systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with IIAR codes and standards.\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nWe have not had an accident involving ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place in the five years prior to April, 2005.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our ammonia refrigeration systems, it is our policy to perform immediate external notifications to applicable agencies (National Response Center, State Emergency Respose Commission, Local Emergency Planning Commission) and request that they respond to the emergency. The Hanover Foods facility is included in the Caroline County Emergency Operations Plan. Procedures are contained therein for response to an emergency involving the ammonia refrigeration systems by non-facility personnel.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nChanges will be implemented as needed as a result of safety evaluations of the refrigeration systems."
