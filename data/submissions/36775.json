The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112(r)(1).  The Prevention Program elements build upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 1910.119. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority policy to comply with applicable Federal and Puerto Rico requirements. The chlorination process at the Utuado Urbana Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, PROSHO and EQB.  Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the Utuado Urbana Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage and use of chlorine. \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Utuado Urbana Filtration Plant supplies water to the surrounding community. Chlorine is used to disinfect the water, destroying microorganisms that could cause illness in humans.\n\nChlorine is delivered to the facility via truck in one ton container. The maximum chlorine storage in the plant is 10,000 pounds. Chlorine containers are connected to chlorinators, a system that regulates vacuum and chlorine flow in the system. The chlorinated water is mixed with potable water for disinfection at two points. \n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program is composed of thirteen elements It's objective is to prevent accidents and protect the human health, the environment, and property.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program.  Chlorine gas detectors are located within the storage area for early detection and warning of any leak.  Leak repair kits are kept on site, and operators are"

The emergency response program is coordinated with Emergency Management Agency for notification of the public.\n\nPRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. All PRASA facilities are scheduled to receive refresher training by September 30, 2004.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years, there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety.  Issues identified from at PHA are then addressed in PRASA Prevention Program. Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more frequent trainings in operating procedures and emergency response, and an improved maintenance program."
