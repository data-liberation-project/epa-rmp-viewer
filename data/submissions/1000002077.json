The building is equipped with ambient ventilation storage area and a fan ventilated control room.  In the event of a chlorine leak the vent system automatically comes on.  All the vent air and any fumes are diluted and then removed from the room by a vent system.\n1.4.2.3.Equipment Design\nThere are two types of chlorine pipe systems, high and low (vacuum) pressure.  The high pressure chlorine piping system is made of chlorine compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or chlorine compatible non metallic compound (not corroded by chlorine) rated to 500 psig.  The maximum pressure of the chlorine in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a 3 to 1 safety factor. The low pressure system operates under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also chlorine compatible.  The system is designed to 150 psig or complete vacuum giving it a large safety factor over the typical vacuum or positive"

Chlorine is used as part of the treatment process. \n1.2.1.SITE DESCRIPTION  (b)(1)\nThe site is owned and operated by The City of Atlantic Beach.  The site is located at 2301 Mayport Road, Atlantic Beach, Duval County, Florida.  The site is boarded by Fleet Landing on the north and east Mayport Road on the west, and Selva Marina Golf Course on the south.\nThe Plant includes a chlorine storage and distribution system contained in a specially designed storage and process building. The boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n1.2.2.REGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\nChlorine is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule threshold quantity.  The City of Atlantic Beach chlorine process was installed as part of the process of purifying water for public consumption.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP).  The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to two process control systems. \nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.

The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \u00c2\u00bfmaximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual\u00c2\u00bfs ability to take protective action.\u00c2\u00bf  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \u00c2\u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected.\u00c2\u00bf\n1.3.1.WORST CASE   (c)(1)\nAtmospheric dispersion assessment for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions.  Results demonstrate a distance of ___ miles to the toxic endpoint.  The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at _____ people.\n1.3.2.ALTERNATIVE CASE   (c)(2)\nThe alternative release scenario involves the failure of the yoke assembly regulator of the pressure system connected to one of the one ton-containers. This failure is equal to creating a 1/16 inch diameter hole in the yoke assembly, the drip tube, a pipe, or even the container.  Assessment using the EPA water guidance demonstrated the rate of chlorine release is 20.0lb./min.  The toxic endpoint distances determined is ___ miles.  The residential population potentially that wo"
