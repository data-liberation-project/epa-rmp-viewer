      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Metropolitan Utility District Financing Authority (SMUDFA) constructed the Cosumnes Power Plant (CPP), a nominal 500 megawatt, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plant approximately 25 miles south south-east of Sacramento, California.  The facility will be operated by Wood Group Power Operations, Inc. under contract to SMUDFA.\nThe facility is subject to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program because the amount of ammonia stored onsite (18,000 gallons of 29 percent ammonia, or approximately 39,200 pounds, as ammonia) exceeds the CalARP threshold quantity (TQ) of 500 pounds.  CPP is also subject to the federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements because aqueous ammonia is stored in concentrations of greater than 20 percent, and the total quantity of 39,200 pounds exceeds the federal TQ of 10,000 pounds.  The Wood Group Power Operators, Inc. prepared this RMP to satisfy CalARP and federal RMP requirements for the aqueous ammonia process at the CPP facility.  \nThe facility falls under the provisions of CalARP and federal RMP Program Level 1 because:\n?As a new facility, there has not been an accidental release of aqueous ammonia in the previous five years leading to an offsite impact greater than the significant impact threshold.\n?The potential impact of a worst-case spill of aqueous ammonia does not produce an impact above the threshold significance level at an offsite public receptor. \n?Emergency procedures are coordinated with the local emergency planning and response organizations. \nThe major hazards represented by the CPP aqueous ammonia process are the accidental release of ammonia, a toxic substance, due to spill or rupture of the storage vessel, associated piping system, or during a tanker truck unloading accident.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Wood Group Power Operators, Inc. is concerned with the safety of its workers and individuals living and working near CP"

Initial emergency response training of facility staff is scheduled to be completed by the time of the first delivery of ammonia occurs at the facility, scheduled for December 2005.  \n\nThe ammonia process is monitored by the plant operator.  Ammonia detectors with audible alarms are located adjacent to the ammonia storage tank.  The containment area is inspected daily by plant operators for evidence of spills, leaks, or other conditions that may lead to a release.\n\nA seismic analysis was conducted for CPP as part of the licensing process.  The CPP facility is designed and constructed to conform to the 2001 California Building Standards Code for Seismic Zone 4.  As part of the licensing process, the California Energy Commission (CEC) concluded that the CPP facility (including the aqueous ammonia system) will be adequately constructed to provide seismic safety in the event of an earthquake.\n\nGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe power plant consists of two General Electric 7FA natural gas-fired combustion turbine generators (CTGs).

      "SummaryText": "umber for the CPP is 221112, Fossil Fuel Electric Power Generation.  CPP is located at 14295 Clay East Road in Herald, California.  The facility is located on approximately 30 acres in Section 29, Township 6N, Range 8E Mount Diablo base and meridian, adjacent to the Rancho Seco Power Plant.  CPP is located on the southeastern quarter of APN 140-0050-010 and on the southwestern quarter of APN 140-0050-008.  The site is zoned AG-80, which is compatible with the land use designation for a power generation facility. \n\nCPP uses aqueous ammonia (29 percent concentration by weight) as the reducing agent in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) pollution control system to minimize emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the CTGs.  Aqueous ammonia is a hazardous substance regulated under the CalARP and federal RMP programs.\n\nDescription of the Equipment and Process \nThe regulated system containing aqueous ammonia consists of an above ground aqueous ammonia storage tank, pumping skid, two vaporizers, piping, and flow controllers used to meter ammonia to the injection grids for the SCR NOx control systems.  The aqueous ammonia is stored in one 18,000-gallon horizontal above-ground steel storage tank.  The storage tank is located within a concrete secondary containment structure capable of holding the entire contents of the tank plus freeboard for precipitation.  Aqueous ammonia will be delivered by tank truck approximately five times per month (60 times per year).  A typical truckload will contain approximately 6,000 gallons of aqueous ammonia.  The truck unloading area adjacent to the storage tank is sloped to capture and contain a spill into the concrete secondary containment structure for the storage tank.  The containment is large enough for the entire contents of the delivery truck.\n\nThe liquid level in the tank is electronically monitored in a cabinet adjacent to the tank.  The tank is protected by a pressure relief valve on the top of the tank and manual drains with s"

Piping into the tank includes one fill line, one vapor return line, one tank drain line, and one outlet line to the ammonia metering system.  Ammonia detectors with audible alarms are located in the storage tank.\n\nCPP purchases aqueous ammonia from a single supplier.  Once the CPP operator reviews the shipping manifest and grants approval to the driver to enter the facility, the truck travels at low speed (10 miles per hour maximum) directly to the unloading area and parks in the unloading containment area adjacent to the aqueous ammonia tank.  The driver secures the truck from movement using wheel chocks.  The driver and plant operator then follow the established unloading procedures.  The driver connects the inlet and vapor return hoses between the truck and the ammonia tank and opens or closes valves, as required.  The truck engine has a safety interlock to prevent operation of the ignition when the truck is pumping.  The truck operator operates all valves, including truck and system valves. \n\nUnloading is accomplished using the transfer pump and vapor recovery system on the truck.  The driver operates the pump to transfer the contents of the truck to the storage tank.  Loading will cease when the plant operator determines the desired liquid level in the tank is reached.  At the completion of loading, all residual liquid and vapors in the hoses and piping are evacuated to the truck prior to disconnection of the hoses.\n\nAmmonia is pumped from the storage tank to the two vaporizer skids through stainless steel piping.  The piping is protected from vehicular damage.  In addition, the access way adjacent to each vaporizer is restricted to maintenance vehicles only and is not subject to normal traffic.\n\nThe SCR system is an emission control system for NOx in the CTG exhaust.

Hot flue gas from the CTG exhaust is used to vaporize the aqueous ammonia prior to injection in the SCR system at a point upstream of the catalyst grid.  At the catalyst bed, ammonia reacts with NOx in the CTG exhaust to form water and elemental nitrogen.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nFacilities subject to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule are required to conduct an analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative accidental releases. An offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed as part of the licensing process for CPP.  The OCA performed for the CEC licensing process was more stringent that that required for the CalARP and RMP programs because a lower impact threshold was used to determine the distance to offsite impact. EPA and federal law enforcement agencies have become concerned that OCA descriptions in RMP executive summaries may pose a security risk.  EPA has eliminated the requirement to include any OCA data in the RMP executive summary.  Therefore, there are no OCA data presented in this executive summary.\n  \nFive Year Accident History\nAs the facility is not yet operating, there have been no reportable accidents exceeding threshold quantities at the CPP facility in the previous five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe Wood Group Power Operators, Inc. will rely on both internal and external resources to respond to emergency situations involving a release of aqueous ammonia.
