This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. The Columbia Midstream Group policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\nColumbia Midstream Group operates the Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant located in Mahoning County, Ohio. This facility receives wellhead gas from wells via pipeline. Condensate and water are separated from the inlet streams. A cryogenic system is used to separate methane from the liquids. The separated methane, known as residue gas, is compressed into a pipeline for offsite delivery. The separated liquids, known as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs), are recovered and sent to NGL pumps where the product is measured and injected into an NGL pipeline for offsite delivery.  NGLs may also be stored in tanks onsite when the NGL pipeline is not available.  This facility is classified as a Program Level 3.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant has not had any accidental releases during the past five (5) years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant. Because plant processes are subject to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\nColumbia Midstream Group and the"

This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information. Employees are involved in maintaining Process Safety Management (PSM) rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.\r\n \r\nProcess Safety Information:\r\nColumbia Midstream Group maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards. This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as design basis/configuration information for key process parameters. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems. The plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings. This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant h"

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check to make sure that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specification, that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place, and that training of each employee involved in operating the process or equipment has been completed. A standard checklist is used to document compliance.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant has well-established programs, procedures and practices that are required to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle lightly hazardous chemicals and/or flammable gas or liquid is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of a release. Equipment examples include vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, and relief and vent systems with associated emergency shutdown systems and controls (i.e., monitoring devices, sensors, alarms, and interlocks). Maintenance personnel receive training on:\r\n(1)\tAn overview of the process. \r\n(2)\tA review of the process hazards. \r\n(3)\tThe procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks to ensure that the employees can perform the job tasks in a safe and satisfactory manner. \r\nProcess equipment inspection and testing follows recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices. Equipment deficiencies that are outside of acceptable limits are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to ensure safe operation.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC):\r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive system to manage and document changes to all covered processes. A systematic approach is followed to control and manage facility changes in order to minimize the possibility that such changes will have a"

Employees involved in process operations and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks might be affected by process changes are informed of and trained, as needed, in the the change prior to process start-up.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. An incident investigation is initiated as promptly as possible to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. This investigation is led by an incident investigation team consisting of those with appropriate knowledge and experience in the process. The findings and recommendations made by the incident investigation team are promptly addressed and resolved in a timely manner. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees who could be affected by the findings.\r\n\r\nEmergency Planning and Response:\r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant retains a written site specific formal emergency response plan which includes the designated actions the company and all personnel will take to ensure personal safety from fire and other emergencies. The plan outlines actions that company technicians and contract employees are to take when there is an unwanted release of highly hazardous chemicals. The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel. The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is properly functioning, the Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being imple"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant primarily uses the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) technique to perform these evaluations. This technique is recognized as one (1) of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed. The Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner. This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates. The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years by the PHA team.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures:\r\nThe Hickory Bend Gas Processing Plant maintains written Operating Procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\r\n(1)\tInitial startup.\r\n(2)\tNormal operations. \r\n(3)\tTemporary operations.\r\n(4)\tEmergency shutdown. \r\n(5)\tEmergency operations. \r\n(6)\tNormal shutdown. \r\n(7)\tStartup following a t"
