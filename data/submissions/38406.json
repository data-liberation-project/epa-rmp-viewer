If an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with out local and county fire departments to mitigate ant release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\nOur primary activity at Mountain View Co-op is the storage and blending of fertilizers fofr sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored and handled would be 145,000 in our 30,000 gallon storage tank.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is in compliance with OSHA's standard on \"Storing and Handling Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries , evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nOur emergency response program is provided to the state and county under the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title 111 (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Mountain View Co-op. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhudrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
