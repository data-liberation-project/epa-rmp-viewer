The release is expected to be isolated by block control valves.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 788 feet or 0.15 mile.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n \nEmployee Participation\n \n  Baker Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n \n  Baker Plant k"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the gas plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n \n  Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Key Process Parameter Document. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n \n  The gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n \nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n \n  Baker Plant has a comprehens"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \n  Baker Plant primarily uses the What-if/Checklist method for identifying hazards. Secondarily, the hazard analysis and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique may also be used. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n \n  The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n \n  To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

      "SummaryText": "Baker Plant Risk Management Plan:\nExecutive Summary\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n \n  Baker Plant has a standing commitment to worker and public to provide a safe work place.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n  Baker Plant is located in Texas County, Oklahoma, 6 miles west of Turpin Oklahoma on highway 64, and 1 mile north.  Baker Plant operates a cryogenic natural gas liquids extraction process. \n \nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n \n  The worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing natural gas liquids who's constituent base includes several regulated substances. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 230,000 lb (90% of the maximum tank level). Pumps are set to keep the tank at 30-32% of full liquid height.  At 40% (89,400 lbs) an alarm will sound in the control room to initiate an investigation of the problem.  At 90% of full liquid height (230,000 lbs), the pumps will shut down, which initiates a chain of events that, in 10 minutes, will shut down the entire plant; therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.49 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage its consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS."

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n \nManagement of Change\n \n  Baker Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n \nIncident Investigation\n \n  Baker Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n \n  In addition, Baker Plant maintains a Key Process Parameter Document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\nTraining\n \n  To complement the written procedures for process operations, Baker Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors\n \n  Baker Plant uses contractor"
