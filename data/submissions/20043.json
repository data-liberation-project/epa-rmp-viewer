      "SummaryText": "ORION REFINING CORPORATION\n\nORION REFINERY; NEW SARPY, LA\nLA ID No. 26003\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Orion Refinery is owned and operated by Orion Refining Corporation, formerly called TransAmerican Refining Corporation.  Orion Refinery is currently operating its Crude Unit, Vacuum Unit, Delayed Coking Unit, three Hydrodesulfurization Units, two Sulfur Units and associated utilities facilities.  The facility's Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) and Alkylation Unit are scheduled to be operational in early 2000.  This facility represents the first new refining capability constructed in the United States over the last 16 years.  The new FCCU will make this refinery one of the highest complexity, lowest-cost-feedstock refineries on the Gulf Coast.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about regulated substances and release scenarios at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  Each of these aspects are summarized below and fully detailed in the RMP.  This submittal is being presented as a correction to the first RMP, which was submitted prior to the June 21, 1999 deadline.  Specifically, there have been corrections made in the RMP substances reported, as well as the quantities of each RMP substance.\n\nRegulated Substances and Release Scenarios.  The Orion Refinery has six flammable substances in amounts estimated to exceed the thresholds for covered substances.  They are Propane, Propylene/Propane mix, Butane, Isobutane, Butylene/Butane mix, and LPG.  In the previous RMP submittal, a flammable mixture containing pentanes and other non-RMP substances was reported as an RMP substance.  However, in this submittal, the mixture has been removed because it does not meet the criteria for classification as an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  It has an NFPA rating of 3 rather than a rating o"

Other corrections made in this submittal are:  LPG has been added to the list of RMP substances present at the Orion Refinery and the amount of each RMP substance has been corrected.   Predictive filing has been implemented to estimate the amount of Butylene/Butane mixture present at the refinery. This substance will not be stored at the facility until the FCCU and the Alkylation Unit become operational in early 2000.  No RMP toxic substances occur over threshold quantities. \n\nUsing the worst case scenario specified for flammables by the EPA, a vapor cloud explosion of the largest vessel containing a regulated flammable substance, the Butylene/Butane sphere would have the greatest impact.  Using the EPA model known as RMPComp (version 1.06) the distance impacted by such an explosion was calculated to be 1.4 miles.  Although numerous in-place controls prevent such an event from occurring, none of those controls are considered in modeling the worst case scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is the worst of what are considered potential release scenarios.  Based on a review of existing Process Hazard Analysis documentation, a flange leak at the Propylene/Propane vessel was calculated to have the greatest off site impact by affecting up to 0.3 miles from the vessel.  No residential areas are located in the area of impact, however, a neighboring chemical facility would be affected if this scenario occurred.  A strategically placed isolation valve, an in-place water curtain safety feature, on site presence of a fire brigade, operator intervention, and other Emergency Response Team actions would be expected to reduce the distance of impact.\n\nPrevention Policies and Programs.  The Orion Refinery operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Facility personnel strive for excellence in PSM by thorough"

      "SummaryText": "ly integrating PSM into the organization's culture.  The PSM program is designed to:\n\n( Reduce the potential for serious incidents\n( Increase plant reliability, efficiency and product quality\n( Minimize the time and resources expended in achieving compliance\n( Promote improved worker morale\n( Diminish the potential for releases with environmental impact\n( Enhance the company image in the community.\n\nEmergency Response Planning.  Orion Refinery has its own Emergency Response Team (ERT) to respond to all on site emergencies.  This team would coordinate with the St. Charles Parish Emergency Operations Center (EOC) personnel during any incidents with potential for off site impacts.  Copies of the Emergency Response Plan as well as ERT planning activities and exercises are coordinated with the EOC Director on an ongoing basis.\n\nAccident History.  No accidents related to RMP substances have occurred at the facility in the past five years.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety.  Continuing compliance with PSM/RMP guidelines and regulations forms the basis of the refinery's commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees as well as a safe community.  The facility benefits from the use of the latest technology in its processes as well as the assurance of the finest training of its employees.  Specific actions planned to improve safety include:\n\n( Evaluation of process changes using Management of Change procedures to ensure safety and health\n( Continual improvement in safety standards through application of the PHA process\n( Use of process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, flares, shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypasses, emergency air and power supplies, backup pumps, grounding equipment, quench and purge systems and rupture disks to prevent or minimize releases \n( Use of mitigation systems such as sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains and neutralization to reduce impacts of any accidental releases\n( Use of process"
