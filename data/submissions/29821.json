Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Orchard Fertilizer Service are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n     a.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railroad car.  The railroad car is only on site two weeks a year.  Administrative controls are in place to prevent an accidental release.\n\n     b.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\n4.  The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111.  Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b.
