Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. encourages personnel to continually identify methods and procedures to reduce the use and risks associated with hazardous chemicals. This process includes protecting the community, environment, and personnel by implementing technology and procedures designed to reduce the impact of any potential release of toxic chemicals. This commitment to safety is documented in the policy and compliance manuals for this facility, which are available to all employees.\n\n\n\nAs part of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s commitment to safe and environmentally friendly operations, monthly meetings are conducted with all employees as well as other more specific operational meetings concerning safety. Input and comments from plant personnel are also key aspects of Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s safety practices: By giving personnel the ability to make suggestions regarding safety and operational practices, the facility can operate efficiently and safely. Another key element in Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc.'s safety practices consists of the regular internal and third party environmental and safety audits. Matheson Tri-Gas recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia, chlorine, and arsine.  \n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined in the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program for this facility.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling of highly hazardous chemicals. Written procedures have been developed for handling and inspecting the chemical cylinders.  The company training policy requires all employees"

The facility's maintenance program requires periodic inspections of process and safety equipment to ensure they are in good condition.  Overall, our program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  \n\n\n\nIncorporated into our program is our Emergency Action Plan (EAP), which details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled chemical release.  The EAP includes procedures for notification of local emergency responders.  The EAP is maintained current and updated periodically.\n\n\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the process and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas is a retail supplier of various compressed gases for industrial, commercial, and medical use.  The facility is located at 15 Green Mountain Drive in Cohoes, NY.  \n\n\n\nThe following regulated RMP-regulated substances are maintained onsite: ammonia, chlorine, and arsine.  These chemicals are stored in cylinders of varying sizes.  The maximum intended inventory for each of the chemicals is listed as follows:\n\n-    maximum 2,400 pounds of Arsine\n\n-    maximum 25,000 pounds of Ammonia\n\n-    maximum 4,950 pounds of Chlorine\n\n\n\nThese chemicals are regulated at the Program 3 level.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas has developed a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program to manage the handling of the regulated substances. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\n\n\n\n1) Safety information that describes the chemical hazards and technical specifications for the process equipment;\n\n2) Written procedu"

Most cylinders are equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpressurization and rupture.  Detectors are installed where the cylinders are stored to warn personnel of a leak.  The cylinders are inspected upon delivery, and any cylinders with damage are rejected and returned to the supplier.  The cylinders are also inspected for leaks and proper labeling.  All other cylinder maintenance is performed by the chemical supply vendor.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents onsite that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no releases of regulated substances that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantities for each of the chemicals.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) dealing with chemical releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite,"

Employees perform evacuation drills and receive refresher training on the EAP.  In the event of a chemical release, the facility emergency coordinators will assess the situation and contact the fire department and an outside emergency response company (Specialized Response Solutions) for assistance.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the regulated processes, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Matheson Tri-Gas has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements.\n\n\n\n"
