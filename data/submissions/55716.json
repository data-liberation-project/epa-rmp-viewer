The state of the art ammonia facility is designed and operated according to current design standards. Seabrook has and will continue to maintain our Risk Management Program as a high priority.\n\n\nFacility Description:\n\nSeabrook operates an ammonia refrigeration system at the Seabrook, NJ facility. Ammonia refrigeration is a major constituent in the processing of frozen vegetables. Refrigeration is accomplished with a closed loop two-stage system utilizing compressors, evaporators and condensers.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe Seabrook program complies with New Jersey TCPA, OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Program requirements.  Since 1988 Seabrook has managed the facility with an approved Risk Management Program.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\no Employee Participation Program\no Process Safety Information\no Process Hazard Analysis\no Operating Procedures\no Training Program\no Contractor Safety Program\no Pre-Startup Safety Review Procedures\no Mechanical Integrity Program\no Hot Work Permit Procedures\no Management of Change Procedures\no Incident Investigation Procedures\no Compliance Audit Procedures\n\nFive -Year Accident History:\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of ammonia which have resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences during the past five years.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe Emergency Response Program addresses the following elements:\n\no On-site emergency response team,\no Governmental responders,\no Emergency notification,\no Procedures and measures for emergency response aft"

These past reviews required evaluations against criteria for design and operation, state-of-the-art, and inherently safer criteria. Based on these evaluations Seabrook determined that the ammonia facility is designed and operated under acceptable risk and no further risk reductions measures are necessary at this time."
