The company has established and implemented procedures to manage changes (except for replacements in kind) to process chemicals, technology equipment and procedures, and changes to facilities that affect the natural gas processing system.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review - As one of the requirements of PSM, Torch is required to perform a pre-startup safety review for new facilities, and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  Although the processes at the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant are essentially mature and therefore the start up of new processes are not anticipated, a PHA will be performed prior to start up for new processes which require a hazardous material above the regulatory threshold.

Accordingly, Torch has an incident investigation program which requires the investigation of each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, release of a flammable material.\n \nEmployee Participation Plan - Torch has developed written procedures to include employees in the development, implementation and management of these PSM program elements.\n\nHot Work & Safe Work Practices - Torch has established safe work practices in place to ensure worker and process safety.

Torch Operating Company (Torch) operates the facility for Nuevo.  It is the policy of Nuevo and Torch that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this end, Torch strives to operate is facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. Nuevo and Torch have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., training of personnel, considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  It is each company's philosophy to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as other substances. \n  \nCompany emergency response policies are implemented to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and minimizing risk to the public.  This is considered to be of prime importance; therefore, all procedures must be carried out in the appropriate manner.  The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel has the highest priority.  Only then can safely executed rescue and medical activities be considered.  Protection of the environment is another high priority.  Only after life, safety, and environmental concerns are addressed will the focus shift to the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery.\n\n1.2  Facility Description\n\nThe Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant is located in Ventura County, approximately 25 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 6 miles south of the town of Piru.

The worse-case release scenario identified some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes minimal public receptors and no residential receptors.  \n\n1.4.2 Alternative Release Scenario - Flammables\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables is a release of propane which results in a vapor cloud fire.  The alternative release scenario could have some off-site impacts, but the impact area includes no off-site residential receptors.\n\n1.5 Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\nIn addition to being subject to RMP requirements the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant is subject to Office of Employee Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions) Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \n\nCompliance with PSM's comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes which handle flammable materials.  The objective of the Company's PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, Torch has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process.  Using this approach, the process design, process technology, process changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements that affect the process are all considered in the evaluation.

The facility is relatively remote and bounded by undeveloped private property on the south and southeast and citrus orchards on the northeast.  A dry creek wash (Torrey Canyon Wash) is located along the northeast boundary of the facility.   \n\nThe Gas Plant consists of one Program 3 process which utilizes several operations to produce natural gas and natural gas liquids product. \n\n Two gas streams come into the plant from local oil production fields and enter separate gas scrubbers and then flow through three compressor skids where the gas is compressed to Gas Company specifications.  The gas is cooled and sent through the turbo expander where gasoline, butanes and propane are dropped out.  The liquids are separated out and sent to a pressure vessel for storage before being trucked offsite to distributors.  The natural gas from the process is dry gas which is sold as a product.\n\n1.3  Regulated Substances\n\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane and iso-pentane are present at the facility.  No regulated toxic substances are present at the facility in excess of the threshold quantities established by this regulation.   \n\n1.4 Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n1.4.1  Worse-Case Release Scenario - Flammables\n\nThe worse-case release for flammables, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is less than the maximum capacity, and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released in 10 minutes and ignited at the point of release.  \n\nThe worse-case release scenario modeled"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address various aspects of emergency proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, notification of local emergency response agencies, evacuation plans for the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant and accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation, and post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Santa Clara Valley Gas Plant has procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms. \n\nApplication of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 (Emergency Action Plans), and the emergency response element of PSM.  The basic concepts of these emergency procedures are to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies.  The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\n\n\n1.9  Planned Changes to"
