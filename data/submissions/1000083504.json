In addition to existing notifications to employees about all incidents, the facility is developing a monthly Accident Alert and Safety Talk program to further constructively engage employees in accident prevention.  In addition to standard safety training, a monthly topic, relevant to the facility's operations or to an incident within BIC Group will be prepared by the Manager, Environment and Safety and then presented by the front-line supervisor or lead to all facility personnel in small conversational groups of 15 persons or less.  The group will discuss the topic and brainstorm various Human Element, Organizational or Technical measures which could prevent or mitigate a similar situation.\r\n\r\nThe facility will also implement an employee-managed, lean behavior-based safety program to observe and report about employee behaviors relevant to the facility's top ha"

The facility warehouses, packages and ships BiC&reg; products which are manufactured at BIC Group's and its third-party manufacturing facilities worldwide. No products are manufactured at this location.  The facility consists of a single building which contains warehouse operations, packaging operations, a quality office, shipping/receiving docks, and office and meeting areas. \r\n\r\nIn addition to various BiC&reg; finished consumer products, the facility handles and packages several types of BiC&reg; lighters, all of which contain less than 5 grams of liquified isobutane gas per lighter. Isobutane is a regulated substance under the US EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) with flammability similar to propane. The facility receives pallets of cartons of packaged lighters by truck/trailer and unloads them using forklifts. The number of lighters in each carton or pallet depends on the type of lighter. Each carton style has bee"

      "SummaryText": "n designed, tested and approved to meet US DOT requirements to protect lighters from damage and prevent activation or release of gas during shipping and handling. The incoming pallets are placed into rack storage. As work orders are received, individual pallets of lighters are transferred via forklift briefly to the temporary holding area of the facility, where materials are staged for the shift's activities. From this location, the pallets are again transferred via forklift to the packaging area. Lighters are unpackaged, then repackaged per individual customer demands.   After the appropriate consumer packaging is applied, the lighters are repackaged into cases.  The cases are re-palletized and then shipped via trucks/trailers to BIC Group's distribution warehouses. \r\n\r\nThe facility is regulated under the Program 1 requirements under the applicability criteria of 40 CFR \u00a768.10, which means that there are no off-site consequences from the handling and storage of isobutane.  \r\n\r\nThe lighter itself is the gas container. The lighter device is made of engineering-grade plastics and metal, designed to withstand high pressures and physical damage. The gas is in the form of a liquified isobutane gas, or LPG. There are several sizes of lighters and the largest contains less than 5 grams of gas.  The reasonable scenarios for a gas release are the physical crushing of a lighter during handling or during automated packaging.  If a lighter is crushed, the LPG isobutane rapidly escapes from the lighter, expands quickly and typically dissipates to non-flammable levels a few feet from the release point.  Because of the small amount of gas in each container, nearly 95 lighters would have to be crushed simultaneously to produce one pound of gas - the minimum amount of gas necessary to evaluate for an off-site consequence per the RMP regulation.  Breaking 95 lighters simultaneously is not a realistic scenario for this site.  In any case, there is absolutely no reasonable scenario tha"

The facility develops and implements programs in support of these Group commitments, including programs for accidental release prevention and emergency response.  Environmental and Safety programs are managed by a full time Manager, Environment and Safety who directly serves the BIC Charlotte, NC facilities. The Manager, Environment and Safety works with facility staff to administer several programs which contribute to release prevention including safe work practices, employee training, preventative maintenance and administrative controls designed to ensure that hazards are identified and that safety issues are identified and addressed.\r\n\r\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nPrevention of accidental releases at the facility is accomplished through compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention provisions; compliance with federal and state environmental, safety, packaging and shipping regulations; and, the application of longstanding corporate philosophies and initiatives which help support safe operations. The following are a few of the examples of the prevention measures which are relevant to this facility:\r\n\r\na.\tBIC Group performs extensive in-line quality testing of every individual lighter produced which not only guarantees safe and reliable operation of the product by the consumer, but also provides an additional measure of safety for all storage and warehousing operations.  This facility handles, stores and transports only BiC &reg; Lighters.\r\nb.\tBIC Group specifically designs and tests its packaging for lighters to minimize damage to both the packa"
