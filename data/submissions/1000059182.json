Executive Summary\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\r\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\r\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR \u00a768\r\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR \u00a75189\r\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119\r\n\r\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\r\n\r\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Anchor Warehouse Exeter has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Anchor Warehouse Exeter, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Anchor Warehouse Exeter has updated their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following process which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \r\n\r\nProcess Name               | Process Chemical              | Process Quantity(lbs.)\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration        Anhydrous Ammonia               21,000\r\n\r\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \r\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet"

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following: (5) Rooms, (3) Precools (1) Hallway.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\nThe precool control valve groups are located along the east exterior wall of the building and the storage room control valves are located inside the hallway along the exterior wall of each respective room. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room. \r\n\r\nThe flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each cold room, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, low pressure liquid is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices incl"

The sensor is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm. Also, all cold storage rooms and hallway are equipped with a standalone device that provides continuous monitoring. Each standalone device is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm.\r\n\r\nAn emergency control box is installed on the east exterior wall of the refrigeration machinery room, which contains three valves. The high and low side of the system each have a valve that would discharge to atmosphere. The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Anchor Warehouse Services Exeter consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Anchor Warehouse Services Exeter is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nAnchor Warehouse Exeter has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.

It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAnchor Warehouse Exeter has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nAnchor Warehouse Exeter's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Anchor Warehouse Exeter has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, Anchor Warehouse Exeter now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
