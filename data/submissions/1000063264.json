The facility has multiple layers of safety, security and technology built into its PPO handling system. Plant Operators are trained to handle PPO safely and are trained to respond to emergencies. \n\n Liquid PPO is received at the facility in rail cars to be unloaded one at a time over a spill containment pan and sump.  Leak detection sensors are located around the rail car unloading platform.  \n\nPPO is pumped from a rail tank car into steel cylinders in a building containing leak detection sensors, ventilation, cooling and a deluge sprinkler system. Vent gas is sent to a scrubber.   The PPO piping system contains automatic shut-off valves which are interlocked with emergency shut-down pull stations located throughout the facility.  All alarms have automatic dial-out to an off-site monitoring station. \n\n"
