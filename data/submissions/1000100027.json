The Hollywood Facility is capable of treating 12 million gallons per day (MGD) of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. Currently, the daily average ranges between 8.2 to 8.7 MGD. The facility uses an activated sludge sewage treatment process and operates 24 hours a day. A maximum of eighteen tons of chlorine gas, the primary disinfectant, are stored on-site. A maximum of ten tons of sulfur dioxide, used in the dechlorination process, are stored on-site. Only three cylinders are in use at one time.\n\n(a)(c) Emergency closures systems are in place to close all three in-use chemical cylinders at once. This system is tested on a regular basis. Ongoing safety training programs cover all phases of facility operation from maintenance and operations safety to safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The Hollywood Road facility conducts formal training as well as on-site training during normal daily operations. A controlled release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide will be defined as the escape of gas resulting from standard operating procedures to connect or disconnect gas containers and standard maintenance procedures on the gas delivery system. Minor leaks in the system that can be promptly repaired or shut off will also be considered controlled releases. (d) Due to this safety training, this facility has not had any significant releases or accidents in the last five years.\n\n(e) This Emergency Response Plan is required under the Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7), Subpart E - Emergency Response for all covered processes.\n\nAn uncontrolled release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas will require the activation of the plant-wide Hollywood Road Facility Emergency Respo"

      "SummaryText": "nse Plan (ERP). The emergency response to the facility will be made by the Amarillo Fire Department, in accordance with the community-based ERP. If the conditions of an uncontrolled release warrant such actions-shelter-in-place, evacuation, public warning-will be implemented by the Amarillo/Potter/Randall Department of Emergency Management. Any instance of uncontrolled release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide gas will be subject to an after-action investigation by the City of Amarillo, exclusive of State and/or Federal Agency regulatory review and oversight.  \n\n(f) Planned changes to improve safety as follows:\n\n    The City of Amarillo Risk Management Department will assume responsibility for conducting the appropriate annual hazard communication training to remain compliant with Rule ?295.7 of TAC Title 25, Part 1, Chapter 295, Subchapter A - Hazard Communication. \n\n\n\n    Utilities Division will conduct more frequent facility-wide ERP drills at all facilities to increase employee awareness with site specific emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\n    The City of Amarillo is transitioning to a paperless, online SDS format for all chemicals stored. This SDS information is accessible at all times, to all employees via app, online application, or QR code.\n\n"
