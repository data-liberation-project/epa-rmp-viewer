The same properties that make butane and propane valuable as fuel also make it necessary to practice certain safety precautions in their handling to prevent leaks, spills and accidents.  First and formost in our operations are the efforts undertaken to ensure employee and contractor safety while on site as well as minimize the risk exposure for the the surrounding communities.  It is Rancho LPG Holdings policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the facility is to store and distribute butane and propane to wholesale customers.  Butane is received and/or distributed via pipieline, rail and transports.  Butane is stored in two refrigerated storage tanks. In addition, butane is also stored in two pressurized, horizontal vessels.  Propane is received and/or distributed via rail or transport trucks.  The propane is stored in three pressurized, horizontal vessels. Propane and butane can also be stored for short durations in rail cars at the site, with four rail cars at the site.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel and contractors.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policies and Practices\n\n\n\nThe site and the company continually strive to improve operations performance including the prevention of incidents, injuries and releases at the facility.  Primary elements of this continuous improvement effort include making capital improvements to the facility as required, maintaing up-to-date procedures and continual training of personnel in both regulatory and job specific subject matter.  The integrity and reliability of major equipment, including pumps, compressors, pipelines and storage tanks is assured through periodic inspection and preventive maintenance. The chemicals handled do not present significant "

These sensors are located at strategic points throughout the facility and work in conjunction with shutdown systems and emergency response equipment also installed onsite. Shutdown systems include automatic postive shutoff valves and other critical interlocks designed to shutdown affected equipment or isolate a problem once detected.\n\n\n\nShould an actual leak occur, emergency response equipment, such as the site's extensive sprinklers systems, would activate to help minimize the hazards assiocated with the leak.  In addition, a continuously operating flare is in service on site to minimize gas emissions to the atmosphere during normal and upset opertions.\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to and abids by OSHA'a Process Safety Management rule for site handling hazards chemicals.  In addition the site complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and all other appicable federal, state and local codes and regulations, including Californias requirments for seismic activity study and design.  When built, this facility was designed in accordance with NFPA 58.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accidental History\n\n\n\nthis facility has not had an accident or release meeting RMP criteria within the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility is considered a non-responding location with no toxic substances on site and as such is not required to maintain an Emergency Response Plan.  An a non-responding facility, the site maintains an Emergency Action Plan which includes procedures for the notification of local fire, law enforcement and medical organizations.  Notification of any potentially affected neighbors would be coordinated through the fire departm"
