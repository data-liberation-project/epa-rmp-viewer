Separated high pressure gas is routed to the inlet of the gas plant.  The gas plant strips out NGL liquids which are stored in an 18,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 170 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.  Liquids from the high pressure separator are routed to lower pressure separation vessels and the oil product is stored in 400 barrel bulk atmospheric storage tanks and removed from the site via transfers to tank trucks. Administrative controls are implemented at the facility which limit the total volumes to 15,500 gallons in the pressurized bullet tank and does not limit the largest bulk oil tank with the condensate remaining at 400 barrels.\n\nThe facility is subject to the RMP requirements since it is a natural gas processing plant producing NGL and contains threshold quantities of Butane as NGL and Pentane as condensate. This facility is able to contain 80,600 lbs of Butane and 92,400 lbs of Pentane.\n\nThe NGL and oil products are a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane, pentane, and isopentane.  For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used (butane for NGL and pentane for condensate).\n\nThis facility has two applicable worst case release scenarios.  Scenario # 1 involves an explosion and fire from an NGL release from the single largest NGL vessel.  The total vessel size is 18,000 gallons with administrative controls implemented at the facility which limit the total v"

Scenario # 2 involves an explosion and fire from a condensate release from the single largest tank. The total tank volume is 400 barrels released into a diked area of approximately 1200 square feet and yields a distance to the endpoint which is 0.09 miles. Section 3.1 of this RMP shows the calculations used for each scenario.\n\nAn alternative scenario is not required for this facility because it is classified as a Program 1 site.  \n\nThe worst case release scenarios use administrative controls to limit the total volume of NGL in the pressurized bullet tanks. Administrative controls were not used on the bulk oil storage tanks the maximum capacity of the single largest vessel was used thus no administrative controls or mitigation measures are used to limit the volume which would limit the distance to the endpoint.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a documented prevention program is not required.  \n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of this plan, the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written Emergency Response Plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of this plan and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety."
