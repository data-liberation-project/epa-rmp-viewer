Back)\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION\nEYES:  Ammonia vapor is an irritant at 100-125 ppm and at 700 ppm can cause serious and permant injury \n   with extreme rapidity.  Exposure to high gas concentrations may lead to tempory blindness and severe tissue damage.  Contact with the liquid can produce severe frostbite or freezing, chemical burns and blindness.  Exposure to ammonia may exaacerbate symptoms in persons with eye disease.\nSKIN:   Liquid solutions and high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can cause blistering or first- and second-degree burns.  Rapid evaporation of the liquid and chemical reaction with the skin's moisture will cause freezing of tissue followed by caistic burn.  Severe injuries can be fatal.  \nINHALATION:   The odor of ammonia, which can be detected at 1-50 ppm, serves as an excellent warning. Accidental exposure to high concentrations (i.e., 400 ppm and above) can cause severe irritation of the respiratory system such as coughing, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, bronchopneumonia and pulmonary edema.  Breathing concentrations of 5,000 ppm has been reported to cause lung inflamation and death by asphyxiation  Continued exposure to lower concentrations of the gas cause irritation to the mucous membranes and upper respiratory tract and possible damage to the lungs.  Exposure to  ammonia may exacerbate symptoms in persons with impaired kidney, liver or pulmonary function.   \nINGESTION:   Can produce corrosion and inflamation of the esophagus, gastritis, abdominal spasms, nausea, faintness, and bluish skin.   Other possible effects are esopheal ulcers that can result in strictures and in gastric, duodenal and jejunal stenosis.   \nTOXICTY VALUES:   LC"

This period covers April 1, 1994 through April 1, 1999.  (68.168)\n     In the event of an emergency, our Emergency Coordinator (EC) Fred Morfitt could muster all personel to the rendezvous area, which is the south driveway upwind of the facility.  There he could have a roll call to make sure all personnel were secure.  From there he could summons the fire department, the police, medical personnel, emergency responders and all others that might be needed.  (68.180)\n     We have training meetings to inform employees of the proper procedures of handling anhydrous ammonia.  We also have meetings informing employees of the hazards associated with handling anhyddrous ammonia.  We also have amock drill to employees of the rendezvous area in the event of an emergency situation.  Our most recent training session on anhydrous ammonia for this year was March 23, 1999.  Any person that pulls tanks or handles anhydrous ammonia was required to be at this training session for anhydrous ammonia safety.  (68.170)\n     Before loading tanks for spring or fall work, a walk around inspection of the facility is done.  This ensures that the pump , pump belts, shields, and personal protection equipment are in place.  By walking around the facility a  person is able to detect any leaks or problems present.

Close vapor valve on both tanks, bled off all pressure.\n     9.  The purged tank is now ready to recieve liquid.  When liquid is introduced to the purged tank, it should be introduced only until the pressure in the tank reaches 50 psi.\n     10. After the tank has reached 50 psi. the purged tank can be filled at anormal rate.\n  An alternate case scenerio, could possibly be a hose rupture of a transfer semi delivering a load to our storage tank.  The release of 500 pounds in 10 minutes could present immediate danger to the operator.  A wind speed of 3 m/s would move product a little over 300 feet.  Safety valves and shut offs would more than likely limit the release to less than the scenario amounts.  There would be a possibility of two homes recieving short term vapor smell.  There would be no other offsite damages.  To prevent a release of this type transfer hoses need to be inspected daily to ensure there are no cracks, breaks, or outdated hoses being used.  To correct a problem before it is present is a safe procedure for all.  OCA Guidance and tables were used to prepare the worst case scenario and the alternate case scenario.  (This scenario didnot happen and is prepared for demonstration)  68.165(b)\n     ANHYDROUS AMMONIA EMERGENCIES\nAny accidental or unintentional release of ammonia to the atmosphere is an emergency.  The seriousness depends on the amount released and the number of persons, animals or crops in the danger zone.\nThe Emergency Action Plan includes making local police and fire departments familiar with the plant's facilities so they can prepare to handle ammonia emergency.  You must also be familiar with the emergency procedure.  \nMost accidents   for anhydrous ammonia can be prevented.

A wind speed of 1.5 m/s would be able to move this material to a 1.8 mile radius.  A disaster situation could exist.  The fire department, police, and other emergency personnel should be called.  The siren could be sounded but the majorityof the people would respond by going to there basements or facility shelters.  The loss of human life could be high as homes, retirement facilities, schools, businesses and city parks and public highways would all be affected.  Pets, livestock, and other animals could also be lost.  Very little could escape the devistation, including trees, crops and all green vegitation.  The recovery factor involved in a disaster of this type would be astronomical.  The possible loss and destruction of 1,900 lives could exist.  Dollar values would be hard to assess.  68.165  (This is only an example and did not happen.)\n     OPERATING PROCEDURES (68.52)\nPURGING TANKS WITH AMMONIA VAPORS\n     1.  Any tank placed into ammonia service, which has been in other service or has been open for any reason must be cleaned of the previous commodity and purged of air before loading ammonia back into the tank.\n     2.  Safety Comes First.  Always wear gloves and goggles that are impervious to ammonia, have water available, and chock wheels of tanks used in this process.\n     3.  Open the liquid line all the way on the tank that is empty but contaminated with air.\n     4.  Connectvapor hose between vapor connection of the tank to be purged and supply tank.  Handle hose end valves by the BODY, NOT by the valve HANDLES.\n     5.  Open vapor control valve on the tank to be purged.\n     6.  Very, Very slowly, slightly open the vapor control valve on the supply tank just enough to barelly hear vapor move to the tank being purged.\n     7.  At the very first detection of ammonia vapor smell, quickly close the liquid valve on the tank being purged\n     8.  Slightly increase"

      "SummaryText": "all visitors must sign in the log book.  This would include contractors, grain inspectors, state inspectors and others doing work at the facility.  The visitor log would  help the EC in locating those personel in the event of an emergency.  Practice and drills are an important part of the plan.  The local fire department and county LEPC's are notified and come to the facility and do a walkthrough, to be better informed in the event of an emergency.  If an emergency did arrise the first person to arrive at the scene must react calmly and appropriately to the situation.  This is where the first person on the scene of an emergency must make a judgment call.  Depending on the severity of the situation, the first person will either call the fire department first, or call the EC first and let the EC decide.  Time is the single most important factor.  The shorter the time of discovery, the lesser the chance of consequences.  If there are lives in danger and the situation is worsening the lives in your hands are first priority.  If a life can be saved without sacrificing your own and you have the resources, do it.  If not get out and get help. The EC would assemble his employees.  Visitors, contractors, salesmen, and other personel signed in the visitor log would have to be accounted for.  Depending on the emergency, the EC would be able to notify the fire department, emergency responders, medical personnel, local police, or anyone that could help with the situation.  Once the situation is under control, any contaminated soil or hazardous waste must be handled properly.  To make sure the emergency does not happen again, all measures must be taken to ensure it does not recur.  Also, any emergency equipment used, should be replaced, or cleaned and repaired and returned to it proper position.  If replacement is not practical, make other arrangements before resuming  operations, and advise all personnel of the change.  APP.A  \n   In a worst case scenario, the release of 79,000"

      "SummaryText": "We have an emergency plan for this facility, however all plans are just that.  Plans.  The real emergency will be the unexpected, and very well be much different from what you expected.  To plan for one type of situation does not ensure that it will happen in the manner you have prepared for.  In the event of a real emergency, it would be a guideline to follow.  We have MSDS sheets on hand which identify the hazardous materialson site.  Our business purpose is to buy and sell grain and to retail other farm related supplies and services.  We are a farm supplier of farming supplies including anhydrous ammonia.  68.185 Our Emergency Plan for the facility describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment from fires, explosions, sudden and non-sudden releases of chemicals, tornadoes, bomb threats,or other accidents occuring on the premises of Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company, Hartley Branch at Hartley Iowa.  Our work is year around.  Work days are Monday through Saturday noon.  Working hours are 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  SPRING SEASON (April -June) workdays are Monday through Sunday.  Work hours are 6:00a.m. to 7:00p.m.  FALL SEASON (October - November)  Work days are 6:00 a.m. to 6:00p.m. (1st shift) and 6:00p.m. to 6:00a.m. (2nd shift)  There is five full time employees at this facility.  The emergency coordinator (EC) is Fred Morfitt.  In the event of an emergency it is important that each employee be already aware of the provisions in the emergency plan and of his or her pre-assigned role in carrying out the plan.  For some employees, that role is passive: just staying put in the assigned rendezvous area, and being available for any task the EC may need to assign.  This role is not to be taken lightly, because accountability is very important.  Safety is not the sole responsibility of the EC in an emegerency, each player must do his part, and is expected to contribute as directedby the EC.  A sign in log is located in the office and"
