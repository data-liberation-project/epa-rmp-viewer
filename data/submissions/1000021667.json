Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.   This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at the design flow rate following the hose rupture and the automatic high flow shutdown failed to activate . Activation of the Emergency Shutdown devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility after an estimated maximum release time of two minutes.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.  The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, the plan is coordinated with the Jackson County Sheriff's Department Emergency Management District, which includes the local Sylva Police department, Jackson County Sheriff's Department, Sylva Fire Department, Jackson County Fire Department, and Emergency Medical Service.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are tr"

If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Enterprise is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\n\nAccident History\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.
