Evaluate existing railcar inspection form and add DOT specification, qualification date, qualification and thickness test date, and PRD qualification date to form. \r\n2. Evaluate existing railcar inspection form and add service equipment qualification date to form. \r\n3. Amend railcar inspection form to include evaluation of an outage. \r\n4. Amend railcar inspection form to include evaluation of RC labeling (Anhydrous Ammonia and Inhalation Hazard).\r\n5. Revise contractor evaluation form to include more specific items that can be used to check that the IFRC is conducting operations in accordance with the way they say they are conducting operations in their PSM. \r\n\r\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company. The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing incidents and employee injuries by combining the GPS process with a positive safety culture."

Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 8645 Suver Road in Monmouth, Oregon (the facility).  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred and temporarily stored by a railcar located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 33,878 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia is used by a mobile third party contractor in a reaction process for the production of ammonium polyphosphate.  The contents of the rail car are consumed in entirety during the reaction process and a maximum of one rail car containing anhydrous ammonia may be present at the facility.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n  \r\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program.
