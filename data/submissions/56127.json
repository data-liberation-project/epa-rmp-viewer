This facility slaughters, processes, packs and stores meat consistent with SIC Code 2011. The facility has operated as a program 2 since 2002 with 2 refrigeration systems less than 10,000 lbs.. An expansion is planned in 2 phases on the East side of the plant. Phase 1 will build a new mechanical room and refrigeration system to accommodate future new building loads and the existing East plant loads. Phase 2 will demo the existing East mechanical room and build a new buidling. To meet MOC requirements a PHA on the new expansion was performed. NH3 inventory is expected to increase above 10,000 lbs in early 2010.  Both refrigeration systems meet ot exceed applicable Building and Fire Codes including water filled diffusion tanks and on-site ponding basins for any run-off. \n\nThe procedures for complying with the RM Program regulations we used are outlined by the following major steps:\n1.    Identify Covered Processes\n2.    Determine Program Level\n3.    Establish a Management System\n4.    Conduct a 5 year Accident History\n5.    Perform Hazard Assessments\n6.    Develop an Accident Prevention Program\n7.    Develop an Emergency Response Program and\n8.    Prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\nOur RMP/PSM has 19 Sections that correspond to RMP/PSM regulatory sections. Publication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40).

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Central Valley Meats are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass meat slaughtering, packing and storage.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for a refrigerant in 2 separate closed loop systems.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nThe worst-case release scenario mandated by the RMP Rule is a standardized hypothetical situation intended to promote ?dialogue?. According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration ?The worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.?\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA?s RMPComp  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed the EPA?s OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest of 2 independent systems.  This release sce"

The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited by the enclosure in direct contact with outside air.  At Class F atmospheric stability, rural location and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. Population estimates for the entire radius is calculated using Landview 6 & Marplot. Actual number that could be affected by the plume area is only 10% of this.\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from either systems ammonia refrigeration system compressor.  The scenario involves the release of 300.00 lb. of .  Toxic ammonia vapor.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles. Actual distances less than .1 mile are recorded as .1 miles. Several public receptors could be impacted if the wind direction was due north. Two small commercial businesses could be impacted. Typically no more than 5 public receptors are in the businesses.\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1998 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nCentral Valley Meats maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our proces"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on4/15/08. All possible conditions that could upset the system and natural disasters like fire and earthquake.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Central Valley Meats maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after maintenance.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nCentral Valley Meats has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nCentral Valley Meats carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
