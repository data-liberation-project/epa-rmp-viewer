The Facility is a chemical distribution plant, which stores, sells, and repackages industrial gases.  The Airgas facility operates from 0400 to 1630 hours, Monday through Friday.  The facility is secured with chain link fencing and yard lights and is staffed with 35 full time employees.\n\nIn accordance with the EPA's RMP regulations (40 CFR Part 68), the facility inventory of chemicals was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were found to be stored in quantities above the EPA threshold quantities .  Based on the facility inventory, the following listed flammable substances are stored by the Facility in quantities above the substance's EPA threshold quantity:\n\nAcetylene gas (CAS # 74-86-2)\nPropane gas (CAS # 74-98-6)\n\nAcetylene is stored at the facility in pressurized cylinders of various sizes, the largest being the 24-pound cylinders.  The maximum amount of acetylene on site at any one time is 40,000 pounds.\n\nPropane is stored on site in two (2) 1,000 gallon (4,400 pounds) bulk tanks, and in various sized cylinders.  In addition to the Propane bulk tanks there is a 1000 gallon (4,400 pounds) Ametalene (Propane) bulk tank with various sized cylinders.  The three 1,000-gallon tanks are used to fill smaller propane/ametalene cylinders for sale/distribution to customers.  The maximum amount of propane on site at any one time is 50,000 pounds.  \n\nIn the last five years, there have been no major accidents associated with either process.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary sources include safe operating procedures and a well trained workforce, along with an emergency response plan and hazardous materials response team.\n\nWith respect to planned changes for safety, the facility is switching from manual beam scales to electronic scales.  This will reduce the likelihood of overfilling propane.  Should additional opport"

      "SummaryText": "unities to improve safety become available, the facility will thoroughly review the feasibility of such a change.\n\nThe EPA requires that the facility identify, analyze and report one-worst case scenario and one alternative case scenario representing all flammable substances held above the applicable threshold quantities.  The worst-case scenario is defined as the release of a substance which results in the greatest release to endpoint (i.e. the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion).  For the alternative case scenario, a more realistic and generally lower amount of the substance can be assumed to be released than that considered for the worst-case scenario.  EPA-approved dispersion model, RMP*Comp, was used to estimate the end point distances for both scenarios.\n\nA worst-case release, as defined in the RMP regulations, is a release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case release amount for the Bessemer plant is therefore, 4,400 lbs of propane, which is the amount of flammable substance in the largest vessel.  EPA RMP*Comp was used to calculate the distance to 1 psi overpressure for a vapor cloud explosion involving 4,400 lbs of propane.  This scenario represents all flammable substances on site, as described above.\n\nIn consultation with Bessemer plant personnel and Airgas Safety Director, a leak in a 33-pound propane cylinder resulting  from the age and fatigue of the valve apparatus was chosen as the most likely alternative case scenario.  For determination of the endpoint distance, it was assumed that the released propane would detonate in a vapor cloud explosion. Similar to the worst-case scenario, EPA RMP*Comp was used to determine the release rate based on vessel parameters, and the release duration was assumed to be approximately one (1) minute. This scenario also represents all flammable substances on site.\n\nAdministrati"
