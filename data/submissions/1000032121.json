The purpose of these operating procedures is to ensure that plant operations are performed in an appropriate, safe, and consistent manner. These operating procedures apply to operations at PGS only. The main objective of the operating procedures is to provide a description of correct methods for performing work-related tasks to PGS personnel. Well-developed operating procedures ensure that tasks are performed correctly, safely, and with the appropriate frequency. Adherence to good operating procedures reduces the risk of incidents including accidental releases. All operating procedures are maintained on the company network, so that all employees can easily access the procedures from any computer at the plant. Printed versions of the procedures are also kept in the control room. The operating procedures are updated whenever a major change to the SCR systems occurs and before the startup of the changed system.  Personnel that work with the SCR system receive initial training on the applicable operating procedures, or when the procedures change. \r\n\r\nThe operating procedures contain a description of the procedures required to startup the entire SCR system, whether it is the initial startup, a startup following a normal or emergency shutdown, or a startup following a major change that requires a hazard review. The operating procedures also describe the operating limits of the SCR system. Procedures are also in place for shutdown of the SCR system under both normal and emergency conditions. Normal operations of the entire SCR system are also described. Temporary and emergency operations are conducted in the same manner as normal operations.

A downstream analyzer measures the total NOx concentration downstream of the SCR reactor outlet. The ammonia demand signal, which regulates the rate at which aqueous ammonia is pumped to the vaporizer, is determined from the readings of both NOx analyzers.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 Aqueous Ammonia Hazards\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia solution that is used for the SCR systems at PGS is 29.4 percent ammonia by weight, with the balance of the weight being water. Aqueous ammonia is a corrosive material although the degree of danger associated with the substance is considered minor. Ammonia is not a known carcinogen, but it poses acute and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards to the respiratory system and chronic non-carcinogenic health hazards as skin irritations or other effects. Acute health hazards are those that occur from short exposures to airborne ammonia vapor, whereas chronic health effects are those that occur as a result of long-term exposures.\r\nThough there is some insoluble ammonia present in the ammonia solution, the solution has a very low vapor pressure compared to anhydrous ammonia, a more hazardous compound that is also used for SCR systems. The ammonia present will not readily vaporize if the solution is released to the atmosphere. If the ammonia evaporates from the solution, the ammonia vapor is irritating at levels above a few parts per million by volume (ppmv) and acutely toxic in high concentrations. A one-hour average ammonia vapor concentration above 200 ppmv could cause respiratory irritation to exposed individuals. \r\nAmmonia vapor is flammable in air at concentrations of 16 percent to 25 percent, but requires a very high temperature source for ignition. Ammonia concentrations directly above an aqueous ammonia spill never approach these concentrations; therefore, aqueous ammonia has no explosive"

In Contra Costa County, the Administering Agency overseeing the CalARP program is the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD).\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the SCR systems, the quantity of aqueous ammonia that is stored and used at Pittsburg Generating Station is greater than both the Federal and State Threshold Quantities; therefore, a RMP is required. As shown in this RMP, a worst-case release from the PGS aqueous ammonia system would cause the toxic endpoint concentration for ammonia (200yppmv) to occur offsite, in an area of Suisun Bay to which the public has access. Therefore, the process cannot be classified as Program 1. Although, aqueous ammonia is listed as a regulated substance in Section 2770.5 of CalARP regulations, the power generation industry is not specifically required to submit extensive Program 3 RMP requirements, and the CCCHSD has determined that the risk posed by this process does not justify classifying the process as Program 3. Accordingly, this process qualifies for a Program 2 RMP under both the CalARP and federal regulations. \r\n\r\nIn order to fulfill the Program 2 requirements, the following actions were completed:\r\n\r\n* Analyze a worst-case and alternative release scenario and perform an offsite consequence analysis.\r\n* Describe the site's accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. \r\n* Ensure that response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies.\r\n* Describe the site's safety program.\r\n* Describe the site's hazard review program.\r\n* Describe the site's operating procedures.\r\n* Describe the site'"

There are seven existing units at PGS: Units 1-4 which have been retired and Units 5-7 which continue to operate for electric power generation.  Units 5 and 6 are each rated at 325 MW and Unit 7 is rated at 720 MW.  The boilers for Units 5 and 6 were manufactured by Babcock and Wilcox and the boiler for Unit 7 was manufactured by Combustion Engineering.\r\n \r\nThe existing Units 5 and 6 at PGS have been retrofitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in order to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), as required to comply with Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Regulation 9, Rule 11, Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Monoxide from Electric Power Generating Steam Boilers.  The retrofit of Unit 6 with an SCR system was completed in February of 2002 and the retrofit of Unit 5 with an SCR system was completed in June of 2002.  At the time that the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems were designed and constructed, it was also planned to retrofit Unit 7 with a SCR system.  Since that time, the project to retrofit Unit 7 with a SCR system was cancelled.  This document addresses the aqueous ammonia systems that are associated with the Unit 5 and Unit 6 SCR systems.\r\n\r\nThe SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia to reduce NOx emissions from the generating units. The concentration of ammonia in the aqueous solution is 29.4% by weight. This substance is listed as a hazardous material under both Federal and California regulations.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment, a federal program was established in 1990 as described in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.
