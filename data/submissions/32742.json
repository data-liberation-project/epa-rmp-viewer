      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nAt the Foamex Plant #3 in Morristown TN, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees ant the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency reponse employees within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce molded polyurethane foam and sold mainly to our automotive customers.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by tank truck and is stored in two indoor storage tanks that are surrounded with a secondary containment wall.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored is 128000 lbs, being the 80% content of our storage capacity of 160,000 lbs isocyanate mixture. The TDI is piped to metering units where it is mixed with other reactants to produce molded polyurethane foam parts.\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored on-site exceeds EPA's threshold q"

Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI does not impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM), (3) The process has had no release of a regulated substance in the past 10 years where exposure to the substance resulted in one or more offsite deaths, injuries, or response or restoration activities for exposure of an environmental receptor, and (4) Foamex has coordinated it's emergency response activities with the local responders.\nThe TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.  Our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n\nRelease detection:\n-Process Alarms\n-Operator Surveillance Activities\n\nRelease Containment/Control:\n-TDI process tanks are piped to overflow into storage tank\n-Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\n-TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n-Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters(e.g. high level, high pressure)\n-Pressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\n-Remote shutdown of unloading and transfer pumps\n-Seal-less TDI pumps.\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process\n-Vapor from storage tank is piped or hosed to the unloading vessel\n\nRelease Mitigation:\n-Fire suppressionand extinguishing systems\n-Trained emergency response personnel\n-Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained bre"

We have had 1 small release of TDI over the past 5 years.  This release occurred inside an operating building and was too small to result in injuries or significant damage\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nOur emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA's emergency action and fire prevention plan regulation, OSHA's hazardous wasted and emergency operations regulation, and EPA's emergency response program requirements in its RMP rule.  Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after and evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs,, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In additon, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modification made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and or trained on those changes.\nThe overall emergency response program for the plant is cordinated with the LEPC.  The plant has around-the -clock communication capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organization such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  T"
