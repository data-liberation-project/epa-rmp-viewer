The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis. In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\n\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 6504 County Road 57 in Willows, California (the \"facility\"). The facility stores and distributes anhydrous ammonia for use in agricultural applications.  Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) is received by truck and stored on-site in an above-ground storage tank(s).  The NH3 is transferred from the storage tank(s) into portable (nurse) tanks and distributed to end users (farmers) for fertilizer application and is also used for the on-site production of aqueous ammonia and for the production of ammonium polyphosphate.  \nAqueous Ammonia is stored in two 125,000-gallon aboveground storage tanks (ASTs). The ASTs are periodically filled from a delivery truck. Aqueous ammonia is transferred from the ASTs into tanker trucks. The contents of the tanker trucks are sold into commerce for the agricultural application of aqueous ammonia. The filled tankers are immediately delivered to the"

The facility does not store full tankers onsite.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the Federal Risk Management Plan program. The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment. The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use. Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility. Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves and ammonia training for personnel.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWillows is a \u0093non-responding facility\u0094 which coordinates with the Willows Fire Department regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous and aqueous ammonia. The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release. The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements:\n1.\tProcedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding"

The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to build strong safety program and positive safety culture.  GPS addresses all aspects of general safety in addition to process safety for our ammonia systems.\nSince the last RMP Submission, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a Safety Data management System using the Enablon platform.  This system, branded \u0093Navigator\u0094, is significantly improving our ability to track events and corrective actions, communicate key learnings,  It also includes a detailed incident investigation element.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has instituted a policy in which all Serious Injury / Fatality (SIF) events are investigated by an independent team using the TapRoot Process."
