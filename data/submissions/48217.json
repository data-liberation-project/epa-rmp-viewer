Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\nIt is the intent of Cook?s Ham to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  Cook?s will also comply with all Federal, State, and local laws.  The Plant Manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  Cook?s Ham takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions such as pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the ongoing integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe facility Environmental Coordinator is responsible for the overall management of the IRM-PSM ammonia safety programs.\n\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCook?s Ham produces pork products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool or freeze the food products and production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the Kansas City, MO facility is approximately 36,000 pounds.   Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the facility. \n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Cook?s Ham ? Kansas City, MO facility has a program level 3 accidental release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard and EPA?s"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-related incidents at the Cook?s Ham ? Kansas City, MO facility during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\n\n\nE.  Description of Emergency Response Program\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Cook?s Ham ? Kansas City, MO facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n?Fire Plan\n?Ammonia Leak Procedures\n?Evacuation Procedures\n\n\nF.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia refrigeration system was analyzed in a March 2007 third party PSM Compliance Audit.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and are being implemented as required."
