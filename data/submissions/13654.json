      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nKUTZ PLANT RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nWilliams Energy Services and the Kutz Plant are strongly committed to the protection of employees, general public and the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources that the company invests in accident prevention including, personnel training, and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of its processes. It is the policy of Kutz plant to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  The plant's emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of trained personnel to respond, control and contain any releases.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\n\nKutz Plant is located in San Juan county, New Mexico, = mile south of Bloomfield and 2 miles east on county Road 4980.  Kutz Plant operates a cryogenic and lean oil absorption natural gas liquids extraction process. The facility processes four regulated substances that include Methane, Ethane, Propane and Butane, all of which are extracted from the inlet natural gas stream.  Refrigerant grade propane is used in the process as a cooling medium.  \n\nWorst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\n\nThe worst case scenario with a release of flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion involving 70% of storage inventory of the products tank containing natural gas liquids which is a mixture of the plant's regulated substances.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 179,768 lbs.  Pumps are set to keep the tank at 26-28% of full liquid height. When the level of the tank reaches 70%, an alarm will sound in the control room to initiate an investigation. A high-pressure alarm will sound before pressure relief devices start relieving. The reduced inventory is assumed to be released, ignited and result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The maximum distance to the 1psi endpoint for this w"

The unconfined vapor travels to its lower flammability limit and ignites, the distance to the 1 psi endpoint for this scenario is 0.25 miles.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nKutz Plant encourages employees to participate in all aspects of Process Safety Management, Risk Management and Accident Prevention.  Employee participation range from updating and compiling technical data for Operating Procedures and Process Safety information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis team.  In addition, Kutz plant has a number of initiatives that address Process Safety, Risk Management and accident prevention. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. Members of the teams represent various areas and functions of the plant.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nKutz Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties, associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories and equipment design basis information.  Process safety information is also used to evaluate proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis ( PHA ):\n\nKutz Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled. The process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The PHA methods for identifying hazards include the -\" what if\" and \"Hazop\" techniques. The PHA's are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance and engineering expertise.

The team makes suggestions for additional prevention measures when appropriate, and forwards their findings to the locations management for resolution. The findings are classified according to relative risk rankings assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that the potential accident scenarios that are assigned the highest risk will receive immediate attention.  All approved action items resulting from the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. All PHA's, team findings, recommendations and tracking status are documented and retained. Revalidation of all PHA's is conducted on a 5-year cycle.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nKutz Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial start-up,  (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) start-up after turnaround.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and verified annually to ensure they are current and accurate.\n\nContractors:\n\nKutz Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors, (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) are aware of any hazards in the workplace, (3) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (4) understand and follow site safety rules, and (5) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work .

Kutz Plant personnel periodically conduct safety audits on contractor performance to ensure that they are working in a safe manner.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's):\n\nKutz conducts a PSSR on any Plant modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR uses a checklist to verify the modification readiness, it involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verifications that the accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\n\nKutz Plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include employee training, written maintenance procedures, inspection/ testing, correcting identified deficiencies and applying quality assurance measures.  Collectively, these activities form a system that maintains the Mechanical Integrity of the process.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Procedures:\n\nKutz has established safe work practices to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these safe work practices include methods for controlling plant entry, presence and exit of support personnel, and lockout/ tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance.
