This commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility. Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.\r\nHowever, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and as such a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nJewell Gas Plant is located south of Wright in Converse County, Wyoming.  It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie: ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas and produce a pipeline quality gas (primarily methane). Additionally, the plant functions to fractionate the natural gas liquids into both a propane and butane/gasoline mixture.  Several pressure vessels at the facility contain regulated substances above threshold quantity.  Vapor cloud release scenarios from each of those vessels was considered such that the worst case release was found to be from V-841 or V-841 (NGL Storage).  There were no public receptors found to be in the radius of exposure for the worst case release.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nJewell Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific PSM program that consists of all of the required 14 elements of PSM. Since this facility is a Program Level 1 facility, a prevention program is not required under RMP.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nJewell Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nJewell Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a ha"

The ERP includes the names and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, medical services/hospitals, regulatory agencies, LEPC, etc.) that may be called upon for assistance.  Liaison with those agencies is maintained to ensure timely and proper responses. Employee understanding of their responsibilities during an emergency situation is high priority.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nRowdy Pipeline believes safety is an value and continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Rowdy also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations. Employee understanding of these policies, programs and procedures is a high priority."
