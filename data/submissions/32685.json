We have discussed this policy with fire department; members of the fire department  have inspected our butane loading system.\n\nThe Sewaren terminal Emergency Response Program uses contingency plans to coordinate all emergency responses.  The contingency plans are designed to provide guidelines for company employees for responding to emergencies and incidents at the terminals.\n\nThe contingency plans are used to respond to various emergencies and are intended to fulfill federal and company requirements under OPA '90 Plan, SPCC Plan, Fire Plan, HAZWOPER Plan and Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan and The Company Emergency Plan which covers general emergencies, disasters threats of violence, bomb threats and demonstrations.\n\nWhile our contingency plans cover a wide variety of emergencies, their main purpose is to define appropriate response measures to a substantial threat of discharge or discharges of oil onto land or into navigable waters of the United States.  Annual training and drills are a part of these contingency plans and are used to exercise and critique the plans.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  The Sewaren Terminal holds monthly safety meetings.  Review and discussion of near misses and potential threats have been added to the meeting to heighten safety awareness and accident prevention.  The incident investigation process at the Terminal will incorporate root cause analyses techniques as another tool to identify the prime causes of incidents.  The case management process of incidents has been a major emphasis area for improvement since 1999.  In addition, behavior based safety process will also be integrated at the Sewaren facility.  The following is a list of training topics that will be provided:\n\n- Basic Principles and Practices of Butane\n- Butane Plant Operations\n- Overview of the RMP standard for all employees"
