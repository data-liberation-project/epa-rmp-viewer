This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release or initiate our emergency action plan if deemed necessary.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant, located near Chico Texas, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from natural gas.  The Upham Chico gas plant has regulated flammables, such as propane and butane. Additionally, the Upham Chico gas plant uses ammonia, which is also a regulated substance.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant is a catastrophic pipe failure in the ammonia refrigeration system, resulting in a release of 3000 pounds over a 10-minute period.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of .14 milligrams per liter for this WCS is .51 miles.  No Program Level 1 processes containing regulated toxic substances were identified at the gas plant.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for ammonia is a pump "

The 25-minute release duration is the approximate time necessary for operators to detect and stop the release.  No other mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of .14 milligrams per liter for this ARS is 0.06 mile.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing propane.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 102,000 lb (80% of the maximum tank capacity); therefore, the reduced inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  Only 38 percent of the propane would flash into vapor and a like amount is included as aerosol and spray. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS (77,520 pounds) is 0.34 mile. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n \nThe ARS for flammable substances at the gas plant is a VCE resulting from the release of propane from a ruptured loading hose (contents in the hose released in seconds after shut-off).  Fisher Type N550 Emergency Shutoff Valves with remote actuators are present on the propane liquid and propane vapor recovery lines.  These valves will contain the release to the propane contents in the loading hose, and  self-closing valves protect the propane transport trailers.  The emergency shut off actuators are located approximately 60 feet south of the fuel islands and mounted near the chain link fence. A red and white emergency sign marks the actuator location.  Bulkheads have been installed at the fuel islands to insure that a hose will part above the emergency valves.  The remote operator site was chosen in"

A simple push of the valve handle will instantly close the ?Snappy Joe? valve at the Fuel Island.  This safety feature will protect both personnel and equipment if a truck fails to disconnect and drives away or if a hose should rupture from other causes.  In the event of a fire at the fuel island, a fusible link will melt at 212 degrees or the poly tubing providing pneumatic pressure to the valves will melt resulting in automatic closure of the Snappy Joe valve.  Again containing the release to the propane contents in the hose.\nThe release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 2 minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.1 mile. This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program. Employees are encouraged to offer suggested changes to the accident prevention plan t"

Representatives from plant operations, maintenance, safety and management, collectively search for methods and materials which will encourage safe operations.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the company are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations section of the PSM/RMP manual. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the var"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant primarily uses the ?What If? analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  ?What If? analysis is recognized as a valuable hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal opera"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Upham Chico gas plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) information about safety and health hazards, (2) emergency response plan requirements, company policy concerning hot work, confined space entry, lockout/tagout and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Upham Chico gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n \nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests,"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Upham Chico gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a procedure to ensure that employees do not enter a permit required confin"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidation"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to gas plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Upham Chico gas plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Upham Chico gas plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n \nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Process relief valves\n\n2. Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high  temperature)\n\n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases on specific tanks\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Trained emergency response personnel\n\n2. Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protec"

Blast-resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There has been one accidental release of 2240 lbs of Ammonia in June 30th, 2000.  We completed all of the necessary notification and reporting requirements for this incident.  The Ammonia release occurred after an operator was performing routine maitenance on a Kerr 250 ammonia reflux pump.  After changing the packing rings in the stuffing box, the operator failed to securely tighten the stuffing box nut.  When the pump was repressurized, the nut came loose and allowed the ammonia to esacape.  There were no injuries associated with the incident.  A Pre-startup Safety Review on any equipment shut down for repairs or maintenance is now executed prior to startup.  We will always investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Upham Chico gas plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response progra"
