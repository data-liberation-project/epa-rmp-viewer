We are committed to creating a culture that takes safety seriously and personally.  Nothing is more important to the company than returning our people home safely at the end of each day.  We believe that all injuries are preventable.  We believe it is the responsibility of each and every employee to prevent injuries, not only to themselves, but to their co-workers.  Each of us has a responsibility to act at all times in a safe manner.  We are committed to being the safety leader in our industry.  Safety awareness on the part of each and every employee is essential to achieve our stated objectives.\n\n\n\nPCS Aurora strives to achieve no damage to the environment at all of our operations.  Our role as environmental stewards is important.  We work every day to protect the land, water, and air surrounding our facility.  The relationships we have with our neighbors and surrounding communities are an important part of what we work so hard to build and maintain.

PCS employees will mitigate, contain the release, and provide emergency medical treatment for any injured on site personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Facility\n\n\n\nThe PCS facility in Aurora, NC covers 12,000 acres and sits along the Pamlico River.  The Pamlico River empties into the Pamlico Sound, ten miles downstream of the facility.  The Aurora facility is the world's largest vertically integrated fertilizer enterprise.  Operations include a phosphate mine, ore refining facilities, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid plants, fertilizer materials plants, and purified phosphoric acid plants.\n\n\n\nThe principal raw materials used at the Aurora site are phosphate rock, sulfur and ammonia.  Phosphate ore is mined in adjacent open pit mines and transported via water slurry in enclosed pipes to the mineral processing area.  Elemental sulfur is transported in railcars and barges to the facility where it is used to produce sulfuric acid, which in turn is used to produce phosphoric acid.  The phosphoric acid is used as the feedstock to produce solid or liquid fertilizers.  Ammonia, in anhydrous form, is transported to the plant in railcars or trucks where it is used to make solid and liquid fertilizers by reacting with phosphoric acid.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the railcars and trucks to storage containers in a specially designed and built facility that incorporates essential safety features.\n\n\n\nPCS Phosphate Aurora facility employees approximately 840 people and because of its isolated location, the facility has its own medical facilities, fire response team, hazardous materials response team, rescue team and medical response team.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe PCS Aurora facility is in full compliance with the OSHA PSM rule.  Additionally, the use of Safety and Operating Procedures provide a system to avert accidental releases by focusing on specific components o"

The safety and operating procedures manual consists of safety and operating procedures, uniquely designed for specific job tasks associated with unloading, storage and use of anhydrous ammonia.  The manual is reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any changes.  Every inbound anhydrous ammonia shipment receives detailed inspections.  Employees and contractors are trained regularly to ensure proficiency in phases of the operation.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia handling system is constructed of stainless steel in many areas.  Operating control systems, video surveillance, and ammonia detection systems provide opportunity for quick response to changes in operating conditions in the railcar and truck unloading areas and ammonia storage area.  Emergency shut off valves and a water deluge system aid in mitigation if a release occurs.  Preventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, replacement of equipment as necessary, and training of personnel all contribute to the prevention of a release.  A work order system is in place to formally report deficiencies and track them until rectified.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe PCS Aurora facility has had only one accident in the past 5 years that is required to be reported in the RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe PCS Aurora facility has developed a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) designed to address prevention, preparation, response, and recovery from a wide variety of potential emergencies to include an accidental release of a regulated substance at the facility.  The facility, its employees, and business operations are susceptible to emergencies, such as natural disasters, severe weather and man-made hazards.  The CEMP, in conjunction with the Risk Management Program and OSHAs Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals Program (PSM), aid in managing potential emergency situations. \n\n\n\nThe facility maintains an aggressive trai"

In addition to the initial training programs for all emergency response team members, annual refresher training is provided along with quarterly drills and exercises.  Emergency response equipment is maintained in prime condition and includes a fully equipped ambulance, hazardous materials response vehicle, two fire trucks and sophisticated rescue apparatus.  The emergency response teams operate under the Incident Command System.  All positions in each response team have at least two alternates and all members of the Emergency Management Group have designated and trained alternates.\n\n\n\nThe PCS Aurora facility coordinates training programs with the local fire and rescue teams.  This training includes joint exercises on an annual basis.  The public is notified by using the county communications system.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility continues to improve initiatives such as focusing on leading indicators, on-site inspections, corporate assessments, third party assessments, safety leadership coaching, etc.  In addition we are improving our safety culture through engagement by focusing on our new corporate initiative, \"4 KEY SAFETY PRIORITIES\":\n\n1. Job Hazard Assessments (JHA) - Taking the time to identify and mitigate hazards before every job\n\n2. Frequent and Structured Pausing - Regularly stopping to reassess for hazards and check for personal focus\n\n3. Serious Injury and Fatality (SIF) Prevention - Creating a purposeful focus on SIF exposures and integrating SIF prevention thinking into all we do\n\n4. Safety Leadership - Creating the right culture of caring through daily effective safety engagement\n\n"
