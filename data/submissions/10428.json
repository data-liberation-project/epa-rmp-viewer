This facility is a Coop grain elevator.  We sell propane to our customers for home heating and farm use.We also sell anyhydrous ammonia and other fertilizers and products used in farming.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one 110,00 gallon storage when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F). resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles.  There is a total of 100 people within the distance to the endpoint.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  We have never had an accident involving propane or andydrous that has caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane or anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the McCune Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We hace discussed this policy with the fire department , members of the fire department have inspected our system"
