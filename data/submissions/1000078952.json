      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION \n\nFutamura USA, Inc., operates a cellophane manufacturing facility near the northeast corner of Tecumseh, Kansas, at 6000 S.E. 2nd Street.  The facility is located along the north side of 2nd Street and has been at this location since 1957.  The nature of the business involves processing of paper pulp and other raw materials to manufacture cellophane film. Our facility's process for liquefying paper pulp uses carbon disulfide in one of the initial steps.  \n\n\n\n\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER EPA'S CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe storage vessels T1001, T1002 and T1003 store carbon disulfide for use in this process, each with a shell capacity of approximately 10,800 gallons and a working volume of 9,000 gallons (i.e., at 10.61 lb./gal., 95,490 pounds of carbon disulfide).  Carbon disulfide is supplied to the storage tanks from an unloading facility designed to accommodate 4,400 gallon (shell capacity) ISO tankers (no more than one of these vessels is on-site at any time).  The maximum on-site inventory of the three carbon disulfide storage vessels at the Futamura USA Tecumseh cellophane manufacturing facility is approximately 286,470 pounds (9,000 gallons of carbon disulfide per vessel) plus the ISO tanker which contains a working volume of 90% of 4,400 gallons (42,016 pounds), and plus the vessels/equipment in the carbon disulfide recovery system which contain an estimated 3,000 gallons (31,830 pounds).  There is thus a maximum of approximately 360,316 pounds of carbon disulfide on-site.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nFutamura USA is committed to the protection of public health and the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Our company and our employees maintain the carbon disulfide system in a safe manner.  We have clear lines of authority and responsibility with respect to all aspects of our release prevention pro"

      "SummaryText": "gram.  We maintain current safety information on carbon disulfide and our carbon disulfide equipment, and review potential hazards that may be associated with the storage and use of carbon disulfide at our facility. \n\n\n\nWe train both our operating and maintenance personnel in our procedures and safe practices.  New employees are trained before being allowed to work on carbon disulfide equipment without close supervision, and periodic refresher training is provided.   When significant changes occur in equipment or processes which could potentially impact the storage or use of carbon disulfide, process hazard analyses or pre-startup safety reviews are performed and affected employees are retrained.  We inspect and audit the carbon disulfide system, using both on-site staff and experienced professionals from outside the facility.\n\n\n\nFutamura USA maintains an employee Emergency Response Team and coordinates response actions with contract HazMat Teams and/or the local Fire Department and government response agencies as appropriate.  We have developed a written emergency response plan and coordinate procedures with the Tecumseh Fire Department.  The plan designates specific actions and procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of carbon disulfide, and designates primary and secondary incident commanders.  It also includes contact information for responsible Futamura USA personnel and emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM, AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nFutamura USA maintains and revises a body of process safety information; conducts periodic process hazard evaluations (see Footnote 1); maintains and revises operating procedures; provides operations specific safety training; maintains a plantwide mechanical integrity (maintenance) program; utilizes MOC and PSSR operations to enhance safety; requires hot work and confined space entry permits for applicable operations; conducts and documents incident investigat"

Plant EH&S personnel submit a variety of performance reports that effectively audit site operations on a routine and periodic basis.\n\n\n\nThe plant is operated 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.  The processing area of the plant is fenced to limit vehicle access, and public access to the facility is restricted by a gate.  The operations area of the plant is lighted.  The plant has an audible alarm system.  Carbon disulfide is stored in containers designed for the chemical's properties, and stored over a water bund within secondary containment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe facility maintains records of recordable and reportable accidents.  In the past five years, this facility has had no accidental releases of carbon disulfide requiring evacuation or shelter-in-place.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nNo changes are currently planned. Continued maintenance and revision of the Prevention Program elements are the basis of continuous safety improvement at Futamura USA.  Our management and operations team is committed to an on-going system of production process review, evaluation of improvements in available technology (including safety features), analysis of previous plant incidents, general and activity-specific safety oversight, and Prevention Program compliance audits to identify opportunities to improve plant safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnote 1: Within the time stipulated under 40 CFR 68.50(d), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) may be  conducted on the entirety of the regulated process (i.e., carbon disulfide load-in, storage, pipe transport and recovery) as one PHA, or as multiple PHAs on components of the regulated process .\n\n"
