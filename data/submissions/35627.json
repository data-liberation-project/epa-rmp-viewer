      "SummaryText": "CHAPTER 1\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nIn accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 68, Subpart G, Section 155 (40 CFR 68.155 and the following as revised April 09,2004), under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Naniwa Energy, has prepared an Executive Summary of the Risk Management Program and Plan for the Tri-Center Power Plant in McCarran, Nevada.  The facility is also subject to the requirements of OSHA?s Process Safety Management program under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The requirements of the PSM program are essentially equivalent to RMP and, therefore, the safety program developed for the facility incorporates the requirements of both programs.\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Naniwa Energy, LLC are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Storey County LEPC has been provided with a copy of Naniwa?s Risk Management Plan.\n1.2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Tri-Center Power Plant produces electrical energy from fossil fuels. The operations are located in McCarran, Nevada. We employ approximately 3 people at the site and operate approximately 18 hours a day 6 days a week during the peak season of June through August.  Non peak months the plant is normally manned Monday ? Friday 0700-1700 and continuously monitored through a remote monitoring service.  Anhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at our facility. \n\nThe Plant consists of six single gas turbine generators that run on natural gas.  The turbines also have the ability to operate "

      "SummaryText": "on liquid fuel during periods of natural gas curtailment.  The exhaust gases leaving the turbines are sent through a two-part catalyst system to reduce the emissions of nitrous oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide by over 90 percent.  Reduction of NOx is accomplished by injecting ammonia vapor into the exhaust gas upstream of a selective catalytic reactor (SCR).  The SCR converts the NOx particles in the exhaust stream to a harmless mixture of nitrogen and water.  The ammonia vapor is generated by controlled release to the exhaust stream of anhydrous ammonia which is liquefied under pressure during storage.\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process is a Program 3 process because it is covered under OSHA Process Safety Management rules.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in one pressurized tank with a capacity of 12,000 gallons.  Liquid Loading procedures only allow 87% filling capacity; therefore the maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at our facility is 10,440 gallons (~54,022 lb.).\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia process at our facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at our anhydrous ammonia source.\n\n1.3.1 Process Safety Information\n      Naniwa Energy, LLC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the process.\n\n1.3.2 Process Hazard Analysis\n      Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expert"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n1.3.4 Training\n      Naniwa Energy, LLC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\n1.3.5 Mechanical Integrity\n      Naniwa Energy, LLC carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n1.3.6 Management of Change\n      Written procedures are in place at Naniwa Energy, LLC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n1.3.7 Pre-startup Reviews\n      Pre-start up "

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n1.3.9 Incident Investigation\n      Naniwa Energy, LLC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n1.3.10 Employee Participation\n      Naniwa Energy, LLC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n1.3.11 Contractors\n      On occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Naniwa Energy, LLC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor?s work and the processes.
