It is the intent of the Spartanburg Terminal to incorporate the most recent procedural guidance (NFPA #58-2011, API 510, API 570) to the extent feasible. If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Croft Fire Department as well as the Spartanburg County Office of Emergency Management (includes LEPC). Medical emergencies will require notification of the local emergency medical services (\"Spartanburg EMS\") and Spartanburg Regional Medical Center.  This facility trains its employees to respond to small or initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Spartanburg Terminal is a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility that includes butane blending operations. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane blending system, including the associated piping, one offload station and one butane storage vessel located on-site.\n\n\n\nThe facility's worst case scenario is the failure of the system's butane storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% fill shut-off with alarm at 80%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The facility's alternate (with potential off-site impact) release scenario is a \"BLEVE\" accident and associated fireball.\n\n\n\nThe Motiva Enterprises LLC - Spartanburg Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119) inclusive of the 14 required elements, and all applicable state and local laws and regulations.
