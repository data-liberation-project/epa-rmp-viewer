Procedures are revised as needed to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\nOXEA Bishop trains employees that will operate the process equipment.  The program involves guided study, independent study, and on-the-job training.  Operators must demonstrate that they have the skills to operate process equipment safely and correctly before they are allowed to work independently.  Operators receive refresher training on a specified schedule.  Training is documented.  Details on the technical training program for operators are available to all employees via the OXEA operations drive.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nOXEA Bishop supplements its workforce by using contractors to perform some routine maintenance.  Contractors are also used during periods of increased maintenance or construction activity.  In order to work for OXEA, contractors must have safety programs at least as stringent as OXEA's.   OXEA Bishop has implemented procedures to assist contractors perform their work in a safe manner, ensure they have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of workplace hazards, understand what they should do should an emergency occur, understand and follow safety rules, and inform OXEA personnel of any hazards they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors an orientation prior to their working on this plant.  OXEA also uses a documented Safe Work Permit process to ensure that the job is evaluated for hazards and that those hazards are mitigated prior to commencing work.  \r\n\r\nOXEA personnel routinely monitor contractor job"

The EPA RMP regulation covers many elements: hazard assessment, prevention programs, and emergency response programs.  The RMP regulation applies to facilities that use more than specified amounts of certain designated chemicals.  The RMP regulation applies to the OXEA Bishop Facility based on its use of acetaldehyde. Processing unit using formaldehyde was shutdown in 2017.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED CHEMICALS\r\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility is located between the communities of Kingsville (Kleberg County) and Bishop (Nueces County), Texas.  It is situated in the extreme southwestern corner of Nueces County.  Four employee shifts operate the facility round-the-clock.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has approximately 32 employees and a small force of contract employees.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Oman Oil purchased OXEA Bishop from Advent International. The production unit now owned by OXEA began production in 1960 and has operated continuously since then.\r\n\r\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility unit is nestled within the larger Celanese facility which covers approximately 1200 acres.  The OXEA Bishop Facility has one Program Level 3 process that use several steps (i.e., hydrogenation, separation, etc.) to produce chemical intermediates.  The OXEA products are then are sold to other chemical manufacturers that use the products in their manufacturing processes.  OXEA products are used in the production of the following types of final products:  polyester, alkyd, and synthetic lubricants; urethane polyols and polymers; multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates for radiation cured coatings; coating and grinding agent for titanium dioxide pigments; polymeric plasticizers; ingredient for cosmetics and personal care pro"

The emergency plan is reviewed annually and revised as needed. Changes triggered by the Management of Change process are administered per that specific program and include training of affected personnel. \r\n\r\nThe Bishop complex emergency response program is coordinated with the Corpus Christi / Nueces County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), City of Bishop Volunteer Fire Department, Kingsville Fire Department, Kleberg County Sheriff's Department, and local ambulance services. The OXEA Bishop Facility has 24-hour communications capability with the emergency response organizations.  Periodic emergency plan drills are conducted and an annual evacuation drill is conducted for all employees.  The emergency response team members train on a continual basis."

The PSSR will help ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. The PSSR provides an additional opportunity to check that construction was executed as specified in the design and all supporting systems are ready. The PSSR involves construction field verification.\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY (MI)\r\nOXEA Bishop uses established practices and procedures to maintain process and support equipment in a safe operating condition. The MI program includes training, inspections, correction of deficiencies, and quality assurance of work products.  Maintenance personnel are trained on the process, safety and health hazards, maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and safe work processes to help ensure that they execute their jobs safely.  Documented equipment files and maintenance histories are maintained. \r\n\r\nInspections and preventive maintenance are performed on a scheduled basis to ensure equipment and safety devices function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  Deficiencies are corrected before placing the equipment back into service or technical experts review continued use of the equipment to determine what actions are needed to ensure safe operation until the deficiency can be corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFE WORK PROCESSES\r\nOXEA Bishop uses an established safe work permit process to ensure worker and process safety.

It requires that changes to process equipment, chemicals, operating technology, procedures, and other changes be reviewed and authorized before implementation. Changes are reviewed to ensure controls are in place to manage new hazards and verify that no existing controls have been compromised.  Changes are documented on corresponding chemical hazard lists, process operating parameters, equipment files, and procedures.  Affected personnel are trained on the changes to be implemented. \r\n\r\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\nOXEA Bishop documents and investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could have reasonably resulted in) a fire, explosion, release, major damage to property or equipment, environmental release / damage, or personal injury. The investigation strives to record the facts of the incident and identify how to prevent recurrence.   Incident information, including required corrective actions, is maintained in an electronic database available to all OXEA employees.  Corrective actions are tracked until completed and final resolution is documented.  Incident investigation data is reviewed at the next scheduled PHA or revalidation.\r\n\r\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\nOXEA Bishop conducts audits PSM programs once every three years.

Because processes at the OXEA Bishop Facility regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, the summary addresses OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility expects all employees to participate in the PSM/RMP program and accident prevention.  It is our belief that the employees operating the equipment are those best equipped to prevent releases.  Employee participation ranges from compiling and updating technical data to participating on process hazard analysis (PHA) and incident investigation teams.  Employees have access to all information related to the accident prevention program and information on accidents themselves.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are detailed in the integrated management system that is maintained on an intranet-based management system available to the global OXEA population.  \r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION (PSI)\r\nThe OXEA Bishop Facility has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the facility.

PHAs are revalidated on a five-year frequency.  Details of the PHA process are available to all OXEA employees in the intranet based integrated management system.
