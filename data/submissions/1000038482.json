All activities involving Chlorine liquid or gas under pressure are confined to the chlorine storage area and scale room.  In the storage area and inside the Chlorine Scale and Chlorinator rooms are located gas leak detectors with a low level alarm setpoint of 1ppm. In the event of a leak greater than 3 ppm an alarm system will be activated which includes siren and lights to advise the employees and visitors of a leak. If a leak occurrs in the chlorine scale room  an auto shut off system  will shut down the ventilation system, closed any chlorine drum valve and contain the leak inside the building. All the doors to the purposed built chlorine storage area and scale room will be kept closed and locked.",

The RMP was prepared in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 and Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112 (1). The Prevention Program elements were built upon the facility's Process Safety Management (PSM) system prepared in compliance with 29 CFR Part 1910.119.\n\n \n\nThe disinfection process at the North Coast Superaqueduct Water Filtration Plant uses chlorine, a hazardous toxic substance regulated by EPA, OSHA, and PROSHO. Due to the hazardous characteristics of chlorine, the North Coast Superaqueduct Water Filtration Plant observes various safety precautions in the storage, conveyance and use of chlorine. The safety precautions are necessary to protect employees, contractors, and visitors at the North Coast Superaqueduct Water Filtration Plant and the immediate surrounding areas. Safety precautions include procedures and equipment to minimize the potential for accidental release, as well as a written emergency response plan for response to any chlorine release that may occur.\n\nThese procedures include the prevention program to be followed in the Chlorine chemical storage area and inside the Chlorine Scale and Chlorinator rooms.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\n\n\nThe North Coast Superaqueduct project is an integrated water treatment and distribution system. It consists of raw water abstraction, storage and pumping to a water treatment plant where potable water is produced.\n\nThe treated water up to 100MGD flows by gravity through a transmission pipeline of approximately 50 Km serving municipalities along the north coast of Puerto Rico and the metropolitan area of San Juan.

It is operated by CH2MHILL, which is responsible for day-to-day operation. Chlorine is used at the water treatment plant for the disinfection of the treated water supply. Chlorine is delivered to site on a purpose built road transporter (contained in 1 ton drums). The unloading, loading and handling of drums is only done using a purpose designed fixed crane and lifting beam. The supplier has been selected after a tendering procedure, which included a review of safety management and operating systems. The chlorine installation is designed so that all chlorine storage, handling and use is carried out in a well-defined single, segregated building. The building is designed to meet local building codes including earthquake protection. The unloading bay and storage area are set back from any site road traffic and fully enclosed by an open sided concrete structure fitted with full height steel mesh panels. \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nPRASA complies with PROSHO requirements for Prevention Programs and for Process Safety Management. Operators, maintenance staff and contractors are informed of chlorine hazards, and hazard signs are posted in the chlorine storage area. Standard operating and maintenance procedures have been developed, and employees who work with chlorine are provided training.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years there have been no unplanned releases of chlorine in excess of 10 pounds resulting in injuries or significant property damage on site: or known offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nPRASA has an emergency response program.

The emergency response program is coordinated with the State Emergency and Disaster Management Agency.\n\n\n\nPRASA periodically conducts various training programs, including emergency response training. All PRASA facilities are scheduled to receive refresher training.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nPRASA uses Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) to identify and recommend changes to ensure a high level of safety. Issues identified fro a PHA are then addressed in PRASA's Prevention Program. Recommendations from the most recent PHA include more training in operating and maintenance procedures, and an improved preventative maintenance program. An audit of the RMP and PSM programs will be conducted within three years to verify the effectiveness of the program. "
