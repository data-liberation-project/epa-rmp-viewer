This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that  they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nThe Southewest Ozona Gas Processing Plant, located 28 miles southwest of Ozona, FM 2083, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant handles methane, ethane, propane and butane which are regulated flammables.  The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances. \nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable materials in processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product surge tank containing 227,708 pounds of a propane, ethane, and butane mix. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.52 miles.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the r"

Specific employees within the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant  are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets.  This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)  \n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and  retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\n\n\n Operating Procedures\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive initial training in Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their"

In addition, the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\n Pre-startup Reviews\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally read.  A PSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance  function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.   Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team=s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination procedures.  In addition the Personal protective equipment has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary.  Any significant changes to the emergency response program are administered through the management of change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n The overall emergency response program for the Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Ozona Fire Department and the local EMT committee. The Southwest Ozona Gas Processing Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the Ozona Fire Dept. and emergency response organizations. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAlthoug"
