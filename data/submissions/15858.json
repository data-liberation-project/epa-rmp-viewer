This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Manufacturer.  We have 6 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide], Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Carbon disulfide, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester], Toluene diisocyanate (unspecified isomer) and Sulfur trioxide.  Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is used for is used as a chemical intermediate, as a drying agent and is a raw material for dyes and detergents.  Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used as a chemical intermediate, refrigerant, bleaching and food processing..  Carbon disulfide, Toluene diisocyanate and Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] are received as a waste stream for energy recovery and raw material value..  Sulfur trioxide is used as an intermediate in the production of high purity acid used in the electronic industry.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] at our facility is 34,000,000 lb., while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Carbon disulfide, Toluene diisocyanate, Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] and Sulfur trioxide are present at our facility in quantities of 2,800,000 lb., 36,000 lb.,"

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Sulfur Dioxide.  In this scenario 300,000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 80% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release of Sulfur Dioxide.  The scenario involves the release of 1,500 lb. liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the length of time the release would occur. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L of Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) is 0.6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Carbon disulfide involves a release from TS Carbon Disulfide.  The scenario involves the release of 1,600 lb. of liqui"

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 570 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of reducing the surface area of the liquid pool and enclosing the gas release inside a building. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.010 mg/L of Sulfur trioxide is 0.26 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] involves a release from Regen 2 Unit.  The scenario involves the release of 2175 lb. of liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the length of time the release would occur.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.01000 mg/L of Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid)  [Sulfuric acid, mixture with sulfur trioxide] is 0.19 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Vinyl acetate monomer  [Acetic acid ethenyl ester] involves a release from TS, (Treatment Services).

      "SummaryText": "valuation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Houston Plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nHouston Plant has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\n\n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nHouston Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nIn order to encourage continuous improvement in all elements of Process Safety the facility  regularly reports progress of improvement efforts that are described in the Process Safety Management Plan.  Many of these improvements are results of audits and other reviews such as Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis, Accident Investigations and others."
