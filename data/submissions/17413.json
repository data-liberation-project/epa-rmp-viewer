Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and sale of fertilizers and other agricultural products.  Anhydrous ammonia, which is used for manufacturing 10-34-0 fertilizer, is also received and stored at the facility.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 320,000 pounds stored in two (2) 34,200 gallon rail tank cars or truck trailers.  The maximum fill level of each rail car or trailer is 85% of the total tank capacity.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when both rail tank cars or trailers are located at the facility and are at the maximum fill level of 85%.    \n\nApproximately once or twice each year, 10-34-0 liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anh"

The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia released would be approximately 160,000 pounds released in a gaseous form over ten (10) minutes.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 2.82 miles.  There was one (1) administrative control considered in this scenario; which is, the rail car is not filled more than 85% full.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release of anhydrous ammonia from a break/rupture in a two (2) inch hose during transfer of ammonia from the rail car.  The quantity of anhydrous ammonia released in a gaseous form would be approximately 12,000 pounds, which is based on a release rate of approximately 6,000 pounds per minute over a two (2) minute time period.  The resulting distance to the toxic endpoint concentration extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The distance to the toxic endpoint concentration (0.14 mg/L) is 1.18 miles.  There were no passive mitigation measures considered in this scenario.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accidental release prevention requirements and applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process. \n\n1) Process Safety Information:  The process equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.

Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the process equipment are maintained and updated. \n\n2) Process Hazard Analysis:  Management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the process.  The process hazard analysis reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the process hazard analysis reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n3) Operating Procedures:  Written operating procedures for the process are readily accessible to workers who operate and maintain the process equipment.  The operating procedures are periodically reviewed and revised as necessary so that they reflect current practices and changes to the process or equipment. \n\n4) Training:  All operators of the process equipment participate in a training program.  Initial training consists of classroom type instruction that covers health and safety hazards, emergency operations and safe work practices.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. \n\n5) Mechanical Integrity:  A written mechanical integrity program is used to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment.  Each employee involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment is trained in an overview of that process and its hazards and in the procedures applicable to the employee's job tasks so that the employee can perform the tasks in a safe manner.  Inspections and tests are performed on process equipment following recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The fre"

Appropriate checks and inspections are performed so that equipment is installed properly and consistent with design specifications and manufacture's instructions.\n                                                                                     \n6) Management of Change:  Written procedures are used to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The written procedures address the following:  technical basis of the proposed change; impact of change on safety and health; modifications to operating procedures; necessary time period for change; and, authorization requirements for the proposed change.  Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are trained and informed of the change prior to start-up of the process or affected part of the process.  Safety information and operating procedures are updated accordingly.\n\n7) Pre-Startup Review:  When modification to a new stationary source or modified stationary source is significant enough to require a change in process safety information, a review of pre-startup safety is performed.  The pre-startup safety review includes a review of the following:  construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate; for a new stationary source, a process hazard analysis has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before startup; and, training of each employee involved in operating a process"
