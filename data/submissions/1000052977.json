Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar Energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\r\n\r\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary. \r\n\r\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request. We will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employees level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\r\n\r\nThe Rock Rapids terminal was built in 1939. The facility was built to store and transport refined products only, but in October of 2015, storage capabilities and pipelines were built for the addition of propane and a liquid mixture (LM)of refined product. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via a 6 inch pipeline, to the Rock Rapids terminal from the NuStar terminal in Yankton, SD. The 2,262,960 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of  the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of six pressurized bullet tanks. The LM is stored in one pressurized  bullet tanks. The propane is removed from the site by propane trucks that deliver it to various customers.\r\n\r\nThe Rock Rapids facility complies with many different regulatory agencies, which include, but not limited to: \r\n-OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (1910.119) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\r\n-OSHAs Emergency Action Plan Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.38(c)\r\n-OSHAs HAZWOPER Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120\r\n-Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990: U.S. DOT Final Rule for Transportation Related On-Shore Facilities as published in 49 CFR Part 194 (Response Plans for Onshore"

We have had no accidental releases in the last five years. The Rock Rapids Emergency Response Program works together with the Rock Rapids Fire Department. The Rock Rapids employees are not first responders, but have received training in the notification process of the Rock Rapids Fire Department (first responder). The employees also participate in an annual evacuation drill, in the event an evacuation is required.\r\n\r\nAll the employees at the Rock Rapids terminal have received annual HAZWOPER training. Numerous other drills are conducted at the Rock Rapids terminal as stated previously.\r\n\r\nSafety is the #1 core value of our company. Whether in performing everyday work or in the planning and maintenance of project work, safety is top priority. some of the future improvements towards safety are:\r\n* Management and employees are working together to achieve the OSHA VPP Star Award. To achieve this award we have instituted the following changes to improve safety:\r\n  - Monthly and Quarterly Hazard Identification Audits\r\n  - Quarterly electrical cord inspections\r\n  - Vehicle First Use inspections\r\n  - Quarterly Ladder inspections\r\n  - Quarterly Lifting sling(s) inspections\r\n* An electronic MSDS (SDS) process has been implemented which allows all users at any of the sites the ability to view and SDS through the company intranet\r\n* The entire region uses CEM (Certified Environmental Management) to perform the Industrial Hygiene testing\r\n* Automatic tank gauging has been implemented which alleviates the need to climb the tanks on a daily basis."
