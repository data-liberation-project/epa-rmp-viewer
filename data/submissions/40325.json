(NZNA) is the largest multipurpose enzyme manufacturing plant in the United States.  NZNA?s mission simply states that \"We will be the preferred partner to our customers and our community.\"  Our commitment to continually improve environmental and safety performance is evidenced by our excellent safety record and our history of environmental improvements within the facility and the community.  Our environmental and safety policies are designed to ensure that this commitment continues.  See the Novozymes web site http://www.novozymes.com for environmental and safety policies as well as historical performance data. \n\nNZNA takes pride in following all applicable safety regulations as well as having internal occupational health and safety (OH&S) programs to prevent hazards in the workplace.  Multiple layers of accident prevention measures include:\n? Routine safety training of employees and contractors\n? Standard operating procedures\n? Process control and detection systems\n? Regular equipment inspections and preventive maintenance programs\n? Regular safety audits\nOur emergency response program involves coordination with the Franklin County Local Emergency Planning Committee, fire departments and emergency responders to develop the best plans possible.  Our written Emergency Action Plan is regularly reviewed and updated, and our employees are routinely trained.\n\nAccident Prevention Program\nNumerous safety systems are in place to prevent a release of ammonia.  Our 5-year accident history indicates our excellent experience, as there have been no reportable releases.  Our compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management (29 CFR 1910.119) provides us with a very structured program that is continually evaluated and improved.   One of the strongest elements of our program is our employee training program which consists of safe operating practices and personal protective equi"

      "SummaryText": "pment.  Our standard operating procedures are updated regularly, and management of change procedures ensure equipment modifications are made with proper safety considerations.  Regular audits of our process safety management program ensure compliance and identify areas for improvement.  Our ammonia system is equipped with relief valves and automated and remote shutoffs, audible and visual warning alarms, and process area monitoring.  Regular equipment inspections and preventive maintenance programs ensure the mechanical integrity of our ammonia system. In late 1999 we installed an alarm system to warn not only our employees but the surrounding community if a large ammonia realease occurs. In addition, a water deluge system was tied into the storage tank relief valve header to mitigate the amount of ammonia vapors released in the event the tank becomes over-pressurized and relief valves operate.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nOur emergency response plan is developed with the assistance of local emergency responders and  the Franklin County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Employees are trained to investigate small leaks of ammonia while wearing proper personal protective equipment.  If a large release of ammonia occurs, employees are trained to shelter-in-place and notify local emergency responders.  If such a release could affect surrounding areas, the county emergency management office has procedures to notify the affected communities.  Drills are conducted periodically to ensure employees are trained in actions to take in the event of an emergency."
