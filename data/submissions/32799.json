Helena will submit the Executive Summary to a central point as specified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prior to June 21, 2004.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR 68.155(a))\n\nHelena?s responsibility for providing its employees with a safe workplace, as well as operating in an environmentally responsible manner, is as important as the quality products and services offered to its customers.  Helena?s Health, Safety, and Environmental Program is committed to provide safe working conditions, and preventing accidents and damages to employees, the environment, and the general public.  Health, safety, and environmental compliance is a fundamental part of every Helena Chemical Company employee?s job.  Helena?s spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If such a release does occur, Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Helena protects the safety of employees, the nearby community, and the environment.\n\n1.2 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\nThe primary activity at Helena?s Friend, Kansas Facility, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to end users.  As defined in 40 CFR 68.3, a stationary source means any buildings, structures, equipment, installations, or substance-emitting stationary activities which belong to the same industrial group, which are located on one or more contiguous properties, from which an accidental release may occur.

The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia at the Facility is 221,000 pounds (lbs.) stored in one 30,000-gallon (gal) bulk storage vessel and twenty 1,000-gal nurse tanks.\n\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\nHelena?s Friend, Kansas Facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements of 40 CFR 68.  This Facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable state and federal regulations as listed in the RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the stationary source.\n\n1.3.1 Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis\n\nHelena maintains a separate written Emergency Action Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with anhydrous ammonia.  Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP.  In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.\n\nThe Facility conducts safety inspections to identify and control the hazards associated with the anhydrous ammonia process Helena inspects the anhydrous ammonia bulk storage vessels, the twenty 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, hoses, valves, gauges, and pumps on a monthly basis, and documents the inspection results.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n1.3.2 Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the Facility associated with anhydrous ammonia, Helena maintains written operating procedures included in the RMP.
