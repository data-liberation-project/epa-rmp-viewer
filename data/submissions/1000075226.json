INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan as it pertains to Cordova - 3M Company.  We take seriously our safety, health, environmental, and regulatory responsibilities to our employees and to the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility going back through much of the company's history.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975. \r\n\r\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release until the Cordova Fire Department and/or other emergency response organizations arrive. We maintain an excellent working relationship with the emergency responders to ensure rapid and effective response. \r\n \r\n\r\n3.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE and THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nWe use two regulated substances at our facility in a quantity regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances and 3M contributes to their safety by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance programs. \r\n\r\nThe following regulated substances are used at Cordova - 3M Company:                                                                                   \r\n- Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), a non-flammable corrosive acid, which is a key raw material used for products to replace ozone-depleting"
