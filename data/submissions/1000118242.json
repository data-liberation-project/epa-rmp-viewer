Operations conducted by RMRS at the Facility include the storage and transload of atmospherically stored fuel products such as ethanol, diesel fuel, transmix, and historically gasoline from rail cars received from the rail line on to truck based transit units for distribution.  As of the submittal of this Executive Summary, the Facility additionally intends to operate a propane transload operation moving propane from delivered Department  of Transportation (DOT) rail cars through the use of a transloader unit into licensed transport trucks.  The transfer is facilitated by a mobile transloader unit; this transloader unit has all the equipment necessary to transfer propane from the rail car to the transport truck.  The transfer equipment is mounted on a trailer to allow it to be secured and moved from site to site via roadways.  The transloader unit has no propane storage vessels and would hold only small quantities of propane when disconnecting and reconnecting between rail cars and would hold no propane after line purging ahead of storage or ending daily operations.  .  \nThe transfer operations and storage of full propane rail cars pending transloading at the Facility are located on"

RMRS employees are to perform all facets of full rail car receipt, inspection, and relocation, the actual propane transfer operations, and empty car relocation and release to the railroad.  \n\nQualified trucking companies will supply DOT listed transport trucks and DOT trained truck drivers to operate the trucks to pick up the propane and deliver it to offsite customers.  The transfer process will be scheduled as needed pursuant to seasonal demand and market conditions; the transloader unit will be secured and parked on site when it is not in use.  The Facility falls within North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 42472 as a petroleum and petroleum product wholesaler except bulk stations and terminals.  Note that no fuel storage occurs at the Facility aside from material found in bulk rail cars."
