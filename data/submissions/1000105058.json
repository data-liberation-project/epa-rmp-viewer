As a non-responding facility, the RMP emergency response program and emergency response plan requirements (40 CFR 68.95) are not applicable at this facility.  However, the facility does maintain an emergency action plan that serves as guidance for facility employees to notify first responders, secure critical operations before evacuation, evacuate the facility, and account for personnel, among other items.  Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in response to small incipient accidental releases.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nThe Area Manager has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program at this facility.  Specific responsibilities are summarized in the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe plant personnel are continually developing new ways to improve the safety of the facility.  This is done through responsibility matrices and training which is a vital part of any safety program.  Training is conducted according to a systematic schedule.  All new and modified equipment is designed with appropriate safety controls and devices."

Process safety information, consisting of technical standards, specifications and levels, promotes safe process design and operation.  Process hazard analysis evaluates hazards against safeguards needed to mitigate likelihood of an accidental release. Process changes are managed through the management of change procedure, by considering the impact that a change will have on the rest of the process.  For new or significantly changed processes, a pre-startup safety review is conducted as a final check to enable safe start up.  \n\nThe employee participation program promotes the development of necessary expertise, experiences, judgment, and proactive initiative within the workforce.  A comprehensive training program ensures that employees are knowledgeable about the processes they are responsible to operate and control.  Operating procedures explain correct startup, operation and shutdown procedures for various equipment in the process.  The hot work program is in place to promote safety of jobs involving potential ignition sources.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that equipment is maintained inspected and tested for ongoing safety.  A contractor safety evaluation program is in place to ensure hire of contractors that will not compromise job or facility safety.   \n\nThe facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release, in order to prevent a similar accident from recurring.  The facility has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program.  \n\n5 YEAR ACCIDENT"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Wildcat Gas Plant is committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors working in the facility, our neighbors in the surrounding community and the environment.  This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Wildcat Gas Plant is located approximately 5.70 miles northwest of Wink, Texas on FM1232 and operates the process to produce the following petroleum products:\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as natural gas liquids)\n2. Condensate\n\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components.  The regulated flammable substances include these same components.  This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nSeveral pressure vessels within the facility process were evaluated for the worst case release scenarios.  Results of the worst case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 3 requirements based on a well pad with active truck loadout to the southwest. \n\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) was also evaluated.  There is no ARS that is more likely than the WCS that would also impact the manned well pad.  \n\nDetails of the release scenarios are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan.\n\nACCI"
