      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nCaldwell recognizes that with ammonia use there are necessary safety precautions in order to protect the safety of their employees and of the nearby community.  It is Caldwell's policy to design and operate a safe facility.  This is accomplished through the experience and training of our personnel.\nOur emergency plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and potentially affected neighbors.  Employees are trained to handle minor leaks. \n\nSource and Regulated Substances\nAmmonia is the only regulated chemical that is on site above the risk management program thresholds.  Caldwell Packing uses ammonia for refrigeration.  Under normal temperature and pressure conditions, ammonia is a gas.  However, in part of the refrigeration process, ammonia is liquefied under pressure.  Refrigeration (or cooling) in the various meat coolers and freezers is accomplished through evaporation of ammonia.  Compressors are used to compress the ammonia gas.  Condensers are used to condense the ammonia gas to a liquid.  The cycle is repeated.\n\nCaldwell installed the ammonia process in 1996.  Major process equipment in the process includes five compressors, an evaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver (HPR), a low pressure receiver (LPR) and cooler/freezer units.  The ammonia system capacity is 19,000 pounds.  The typical inventory for ammonia is 12,000 pounds. \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nConsistent with regulatory requirements for this process, the worst case release is the greatest amount in a single vessel.  The worst case release quantity for Caldwell is the amount held in the high pressure liquid receiver.  The maximum ammonia in the receiver (13,000 pounds of ammonia) is assumed to be released over a time frame of 10 minutes.  No controls or mitigation were considered for the worst case release of ammonia.  There are relatively few buildings or trees in the vicinity of the process so rural topography "

      "SummaryText": "was assumed.  The distance to endpoint for the worst case scenario is 2.2 miles.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\nThe alternate release scenario for the ammonia process assumes a compressor seal fails thus releasing ammonia.  The alternate release has an estimated release rate of 1.3 pounds per minute.  The release occurs under typical conditions (including wind speed).  This release is assumed to occur over a 30-minute period and has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles.\n\nAdministrative Controls and Mitigation Measures\nCaldwell has policies and procedures in place to decrease the likelihood a ammonia release event and to minimize the consequence if there is a release. Operators are trained in the proper usage and handling of these chemicals.\n\nThe process area has an ammonia gas detector which will signal an alarm on the computer.\n\nGeneral Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps\nThe ammonia process complies with both the EPA prevention program level 3 requirements and the OSHA PSM requirements. The facility is operated according to manufacturer recommendations and International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration recommendations.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nCaldwell has not had any releases from this ammonia process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe emergency action plan has been coordinated with the Windom Fire Department.\n\nPlanned Changes\nBy the year 2001, Caldwell plans to add two additional cooling units to the ammonia process."
