Equipment under Covered Process 2 (Storage & Handling) includes (4) 12,000-gallon stationary storage tanks and ancillary pump, piping, and valves; (2) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks; (35) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks; (11) 1,000-gallon double nurse tanks; and (6) 1,500-gallon double nurse tanks.  Helena personnel perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the railcars to the storage tank, and from the storage tank to the nurse tanks in accordance with the Operating Procedures provided in the RMPr.\n\n\n\nHelena receives bulk shipments of anhydrous ammonia both by railcar (as discussed above) and by a vendor that transports the anhydrous ammonia with a 9,600-gallon commercial tanker truck. The commercial tanker truck is temporarily parked on the Facility property while the anhydrous ammonia is transferred to the on-site storage tank. The transfer process from the commercial truck is performed by the commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor). Helena does not own or operate the commercial tanker truck. The vendor is responsible to Helena for complying with relevant operation and training procedures and documentation.  At a minimum, the vendor must (1) have in place and certify compliance with applicable and relevant DOT and OSHA regulations, (2) make available to Helena and EPA upon request any contractor-related documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance, and (3) certify that it has in place emergency shut-down procedures for ammonia unloading operations and that its OSHA and DOT programs comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements. Further, Helena will provide a copy of its Contingency Plan and RMPr for review upon request by the Vendor.\n\n",

      "SummaryText": "The Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Avalon, WI Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Avalon, WI Facility located northwest of Avalon, WI.  The physical address to the Facility is 2832 Old Highway, Avalon, WI 53505.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Avalon, WI Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Avalon, WI Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena is submitting this as as a correction to reflect the adjustment in the nurse tank inventory and total chemical quantity stored at the Facility.\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Operations at the Avalon, WI Facility consist of agricultural chemical storage and handling, retail sale, and distribution.  As related to the RMP, the Avalon Facility stores and handles one covered chemical (i.e. anhydrous ammonia) at quantities that exceed the threshold quantity established by EPA.  Two covered processes are operated at this Facility and they include: \n\n    \n\no    Covered Process 1: Railcar Storage (Anhydrous Ammonia) \n\no    Covered Process 2: Storage and Handling (Anhydr"

      "SummaryText": "ous Ammonia)\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via 34,000-gallon railcars or by commercial tanker truck (9,600 gallon).  Trained Facility personnel receive, secure, and perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from the railcars to the storage tanks.  The Vendor Operator of the commercial tanker truck performs the transfer of anhydrous ammonia from its truck to the storage tanks.      \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary storage tanks and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates (35) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks, (11) 1,000-gallon double nurse tanks, (2) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks, and (6) 1,500-gallon double nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case offsite consequence analyses were completed for both the ammonia storage processes.  The worst case release scenario is the same for the both the railcar storage and anhydrous ammonia storage and handling processes because the largest vessel (i.e. a 34,000-gallon railcar) is common to both of the covered processes when connected.  The worst case scenario release for the Avalon Facility was modeled as if the 34,000-gallon railcar was punctured on the side at the ground level and the resulting release being a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenarios are different for the two processes.  For the railcar storage covered process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that an operator fails to fully close the vapor valve on the railcar.  For the anhydrous ammonia storage and handling process, the alternative consequence analysis assumes that a 3-inch liquid transfer hose is severed during the transfer process.  Although these events are classified as an altern"

      "SummaryText": "ative scenario, even an accident of these types is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow vales, backflow check valves, emergency shutoff valves) and operating procedures that the Facility and the Vendor Operators use to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nHelena's Avalon, WI Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Avalon, WI Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Avalon, WI Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Avalon, WI Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Rock County LEPC and the Clinton Fire Protection District.  \n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Avalon, WI Facility.\n\n"
