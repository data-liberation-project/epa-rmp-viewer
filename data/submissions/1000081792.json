Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage and handling of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.  The facility maintains approximately fifty-six (56) 1,000 gallon nurse tanks for customer use.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the nurse tanks is approximately 261,000 pounds.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored in the stationary tanks at the facility is approximately 317,000 pounds stored in one (1) 26,000 gallon storage tank, one (1) 18,000 gallon storage tank and two (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum fill level of each tank is 85% of the total tank capacity, which is controlled by a liquid level gauge.  This facility is loaded strictly by transport truck; therefore, the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility would be approximately 578,000 pounds.  This would occur when all of the nurse tanks and the four (4) on-site storage tanks are at the maximum fi"

The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility, which is the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Sections 8 through 19 briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n1) Safety Information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility. \n\n\n\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\"."

Initial training for new employees consists of classroom type instruction (e.g., reading safety information, operating procedures and response measures followed by a written test) and on-the-job supervision.  Refresher training for all employees is conducted at least once every three (3) years.  The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary. Upon request, training records can be produced for United Farmers Coop employees.\n\n\n\n5) Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.  Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations (i.e., the provisions of the OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\") or industry codes (i.e., the provisions of the ANSI standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\").
