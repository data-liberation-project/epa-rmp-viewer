Harris Water plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities encompass filtration and production of drinking water.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Chlorine.  Chlorine is used for bacterial disinfection.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 22000.00 lb.\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Chlorine Disinfection.  In this scenario 2000 lb. of Chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been limited to 9.1% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlo"

Toxic gas is assumed to be released to from a hole or connection producing a small leak.  The 180 minutes the estimated time would take the responding agency to be on site and stop the leak.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of Chlorine is 0.07 miles.\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is Checklist and What-Ifs.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with thorough knowledge of the mechanical equipment and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 30 months.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/21/2004.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operat"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 2 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 04/21/2004.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant.  The most recent review was performed on 03/24/1998.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedure"

Harris Water plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 04/21/2004.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nCity of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  City employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u00bfs implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  City of Eden, Robert A. Harris Water plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor\u00bfs work and the processes.

Harris Water plant carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nRockingham County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. Managers from our plant regularly attend and participate in the LEPC meetings.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  These changes were implemented before June 23, 1999.  There are no planned changes in our process, operation, procedures or emergency response at this time."
