Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nWe at Versacold are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by implementation of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the system design, equipment installation, operating procedures, mechanical preventive maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls according to industry standards to prevent possible releases of ammonia.  Un-foreseeable, if such a release does occur; trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of small ammonia releases.  We also coordinated emergency response with the Madison County Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is approximately 18,400 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements and submits tier II reports annually.  The following sections briefly describe the PSM elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\nAll refrigeration equipment technical operating specification are compiled onsite.  The safety information includes but is not limited to, ammonia inventory calculations, materials of construction, design codes and st"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-If Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with PHA team leader training, expertise in the safe operation of the refrigeration process and are revalidated when ever required due to process changes or at a regular interval of every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner with all due speed.\nOperating Procedures:\nVersacold maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.  Safe work procedures to address hot work permits, lock out and tag out, confined space and personal protective equipment use are also adhered to by employees and contractors alike.\n\nTraining:\nVersacold require that all refrigeration employees are trained thoroughly by participating with ammonia awareness, process safety programs requirements such as the process hazard analysis, compliance audits, the development of operating procedures, and the maintenance and inspection requirements for all equipment in the system.  The program is to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the procedures associated with the refrigeration processes.  New employees receive basic classroom training in process operations, followed by on"

Refresher training is provided as often as necessary when affected by a change to the system, at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nVersacold carries out maintenance checks and inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operation by using a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS).  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, ammonia detection, controls and pumps and more including other facility systems.  Qualified personnel and contractor employees when required carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are followed up and corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at Versacold to manage change in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, training to deal with the modifications.  Any changes including like kind replacements are documented for reference in any future training and hazard studies.   \n\nPre-Startup Reviews:\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Versacold.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, and safe work practices are in place and suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nVersacold conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP Rule are being implemented.

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years. To date no major incidents have occurred at the Pendleton faciolity in the prior five years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nVersacold believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all process safety information that is created as part of the facilities implementation of the RMP release prevention program, including information resulting from process hazard analysis, and in particular any incident investigations that are recorded.\n\nContractors:\nOn occasion, Versacold hires contractors to conduct specialized refrigeration maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractorA?s safety performance is completed.  Versacold has a strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractorA?s work and the process.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. 5-Year Accident History:\nThis facility has no reported accidents during the past 5 years.  \n\n5.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral developments and PHA findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  We will continue our annual facility evacuation drills and planning/training site visits with the Local Fire Department in Pendleton, IN. in the future.\n"
