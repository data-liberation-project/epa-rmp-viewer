According to EPA guidelines, the toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).\n\nChlorine Release\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for chlorine is determined using the EPA guidelines presented in the \"Risk Management Guide for Offsite Consequences Analysis\". The worst-case scenario assumes that the entire quantity of a single vessel would be released over a period of 10 minutes. For a 2,000-pound vessel, this calculates to a release rate of 200 lb./min, however when using RMP Comp and checking in an enclosed room, release becomes 110 lb./min. Other factors are taken into consideration in the determination of a toxic endpoint, including the terrain of the surrounding area (rural or urban), typical weather conditions and chemical density. The following factors were used in \u00b7the calculation of the toxic endpoint for this facility: Wind speed 1.5 m/s; Atmospheric Stability Class F; Temperature 25\u00b0; Humidity 50%; Rural Surrounding; Height of release 0-feet (ground level). For wastewater treatment plants, chlorine is always assumed to be dense gas which travels close to the ground surface. A rural surrounding terrain was chosen because it is generally flat and unobstructed.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the plant was developed using the EPA\u0092s screening tool RMP*COMP, and the distance to a toxic endpoint for chlorine in an urban area is 0.9 miles at a release rate of 200-lb/min. A map showing the toxic endpoint radius around the plant is included in the plan.\n\n\n6.0\tOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \u0096 ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n\nAlternative release scenarios have been de"

The below scenarios were considered as part of the evaluation:\n\u0095\tScenario 1 - Transfer releases due to spills or sudden hose uncoupling considered and not completed as the system is under vacuum and will shut system down.\n\u0095\tScenario 2 - Process piping releases from failures at flanges joints, welds, valves, and valve seals and drain or bleed considered and not completed for same reason as scenario 1.\n\u0095\tScenario 3 - Process vessel or pump releases due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure considered but not selected because vessels are inspected on receipt and not put in service if there are deficiencies.\n\u0095\tScenario 4 - Vessel overfilling and spill, or over pressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks considered and not selected because Inframark does not fill the tanks.\n\u0095\tScenario 5 - Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncture leading to a spill considered and selected as most likely to cause a release.\n\nAn alternative scenario is described as a release event that reaches an endpoint offsite and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. There have not been any offsite release incidents at the which could be referenced as an alternative scenario. Therefore, default conditions as suggested by the EPA Risk Management Plan guidelines were used to determine the alternative release scenarios for chlorine.

      "SummaryText": "ents at the plant.\n\n8.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Emergency Response Program (ERP) is an important element of the Inframark RMP program.   The purpose of the ERP is to ensure that proper preparation, response, recovery, and consequence mitigation procedures are in place for accidental releases of chlorine resulting from natural disaster, human error, equipment failure, or sabotage.  The goals of this program include the following:\n?\tProtect the public\u0092s health and the environment.\n?\tProtect the health of facility staff and contract employees.\n?\tProtect the health of local emergency response agency personnel.\n?\tCoordinate emergency response actions between the local emergency response agencies and facility staff.\n?\tProvide emergency response procedures to be followed by facility personnel during emergency situations.\n\nThere are no facilities employees designated or qualified to respond to an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance; therefore, the plant would be considered a non-responding facility by EPA standards. An incidental release which does not cause a potential safety or health hazard or that can be neutralized or controlled at the time of release by an on-site operator would not be considered an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. An Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facility to address incidental releases. \n\nThe chlorine storage area is monitored by vapor detection units, which notify the facility operations company by auto-dialer in the event of an accidental release of chlorine. Additionally, an alarm and flashing light system alert on-site personnel to the presence of a chemical release.\n\nResponse coordination efforts have been made with the local Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Commission. \n\n\n9.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nAt this time there are no projects planned however, any significant change in the processes or equipment at the plant shall trigger an update of the Safety Information included as p"
