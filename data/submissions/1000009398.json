      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt the Nu-Foam Products, Inc. (Nu-Foam) plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and is regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  TDI is considered a toxic substance, and associated safety precautions have been implemented to (1) prevent unnecessary human exposure, (2) reduce the threat to the health of our employees at the Nu-Foam Chattanooga plant, and (3) reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employees, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and is used to produce furniture, bedding, carpet padding and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce our polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by railcar and by tank truck, and is stored in two indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in the process (i.e., in storage tanks and in up to seven standby railcars) at our plant is about 750,000 l"

      "SummaryText": "b.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam products are shipped to customers by truck.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPAA?s risk management program (RMP) rule.  This substance is covered because the maximum quantity contained in our TDI process exceeds EPAA?s threshold quantity of 10,000 lb for TDI.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios\n\n(DELETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 4/9/2004 Rulemaking)\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPAA?s Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst-case release scenario for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is exempt from OSHA's process safety management standard, and (3) our polyurethane foam process has not been targeted by the EPA for Level 3 coverage.  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\nA? Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes, and equipment\n \nA? Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes, and procedures\n \nA? Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n \nA? Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs\n \nA? Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes\n \nA? Confirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consistent with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the RMP rule\n \nA?

The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI-using process.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and management system failures.\n \n In addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) quickly detect a release, (2) contain or control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n \nA? Release Detection \n \nA? Process alarms (e.g., high level alarms and flow cutoff relays on the TDI storage tanks)\nA? Continuous operator surveillance (e.g., during TDI tanker unloading and TDI supply to the foam process)\nA? Portable TDI monitor has been purchased and is used at least quarterly to determine whether the ventilation/capture system is working properly.\n \nA? Release Containment/Control\n \nA? Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\nA? TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\nA? Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters (e.g., high pressure)\nA? Pressure relief devices on equipment to prevent rupture\nA? Valves to permit isolation of process equipment\nA? TDI railcar inner tank surrounded by an outer shell filled with insulation\nA? Vapor displaced from storage tanks during unloading is vented through a carbon filter\n \nA? Release Mitigation\n \nA? Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\nA? Trained emergency response personnel\nA? Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breath"

Our Emergency Action Program/Contingency Plan includes procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  Our procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities, by using management of change procedures.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\n \n The emergency response plan for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes providing them with a copy of the ERP and subsequent telephone call and invitation to tour the plant.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n \n Planned changes"

Our hazard review and incident investigation programs are especially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the process.  The RMP is viewed as a living document and will be subject to revisions as appropriate, based on process changes and on-the-job evaluations of existing procedures, which will then be submitted to the Management Review Committee prior to implementation of recommended changes.\n \n Past changes to improve safety\n\nA? Purchased portable TDI monitor to ensure proper capture and ventilation of TDI vapors\n\nA? Provided high-level alarm of the TDI and other feeds to prevent overfilling the TDI storage tanks\n \nA? Revised operating procedures to resolve findings from the latest TDI process hazard review."
