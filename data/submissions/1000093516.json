Incident Investigation - ANPI investigates each incident that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, an accidental release of a regulated substance. An ANPI investigation team immediately initiates an incident investigation. The ANPI investigation team prepares an incident report and develops a system to address and resolve report findings and recommendations. In addition, the incident investigation report is reviewed with all affected ANPI personnel and the report is retained for five years.\r\n\r\n12. Compliance Audit - At least every three years, ANPI evaluates compliance with the provisions of the PSM. ANPI specifies the requirements for the audit team and the report.

Whether a release of anhydrous ammonia poses a threat to health depends on the concentration of ammonia in the air and the duration of exposure. If individuals remain exposed to high concentrations of ammonia in air for long periods of time, any or all of the following health effects could occur: 1) eye contact: severe irritation, swelling, partial or full blindness; 2) skin contact: severe irritation, blisters; and 3) inhalation: difficulty breathing, lung damage, and death by suffocation.\r\n\r\nANPI's RMP is designed to reduce the number and severity of potential regulated substance releases. This reduces ANPI's risk to offsite receptors near the ANPI facility. At the ANPI facility, the frequency and severity of a regulated substance release is reduced through the implementation of effective prevention, management, mitigation, and emergency response (ER) measures.\r\n\r\nANPI's RMP reduces the likelihood of a regulated substance release by implementing a prevention program. An organizational chart illustrating ANPI's prevention program management system is available.\r\n\r\nANPI's prevention program elements are the same as the requirements for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). ANPI has qualified employees trained in PSM and has established an organization to assure proper implementation of PSM within the RMP.\r\n\r\nANPI implements a set of twelve management areas designed to protect worker health and safety in the event of accidental releases. To address the hazards of a potential regulated substance release, the following PSM steps are taken at the ANPI facility:\r\n\r\n1.

ANPI informs contractors of process hazards and applicable parts of ANPI's Emergency Response Program (ERP). ANPI has developed and implements safe work practices to control contractor access to the manufacturing process areas. ANPI conducts periodic walk-through inspections to evaluate the safety performance of contractors. ANPI's policy is to hire qualified contractors who are trained to safely perform their jobs and who are knowledgeable in the hazards related to their jobs.

Anhydrous ammonia is imported to the ANPI facility by railcar and by truck\u00a0. The railcars and trucks \u00a0are unloaded into the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area. Ammonia then enters into ANPI's Nitric Acid Plants (AOP3 and AOP4). The resulting acid, below the minimum 80% concentration referenced in the RMP rule, feeds into the Neutralizer where it is reacted with more ammonia to produce Ammonium Nitrate Solution. The majority of the ANS is then pumped to the Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant where it is concentrated and converted from liquid to solid form. The remaining ANS is either sold directly to customers or converted into fertilizer solutions. ANS is used to produce several liquid fertilizers to serve the seasonal needs of the agricultural industry.\r\n\r\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe potential hazards associated with ANPI's manufacturing process are related to chemical releases, equipment failures, and process upsets.

ANPI (formerly the Apache Powder Company) has been manufacturing at its Cochise County facility since 1922. ANPI established a mission to be best in its class and recognizes that attaining that commitment means operating and maintaining its manufacturing process in a safe and responsible manner. To prevent accidental releases of regulated\u00a0 substances, ANPI has developed and is implementing a comprehensive Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. ANPI understands the risks associated with releases of regulated substances and ensures that those risks are being well managed at its facility.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure the safety of its employees and the public as well as to protect the environment, ANPI's RMP is a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning programs. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in place at ANPI.\r\n\r\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nANPI manufactures nitrogen-based chemical products for the mining and agricultural industries.
