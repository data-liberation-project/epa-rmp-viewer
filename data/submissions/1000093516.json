      "SummaryText": "1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES \n\n\n\nApache Nitrogen Products, Inc. (ANPI) manufactures nitrogen-based chemical products for the mining and agricultural industries. ANPI (formerly the Apache Powder Company) has been manufacturing at its Cochise County facility since 1922. ANPI established a mission to be \"best in its class\" and recognizes that attaining that commitment means operating and maintaining its manufacturing process in a safe and responsible manner. To prevent accidental releases of regulated  substances, ANPI has developed and is implementing a comprehensive Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. ANPI understands the risks associated with releases of regulated substances and ensures that those risks are being well managed at its facility.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure the safety of its employees and the public as well as to protect the environment, ANPI's RMP is a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency planning programs. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in place at ANPI.\n\n\n\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nANPI manufactures nitrogen-based chemical products for the mining and agricultural industries. In simplest terms, ANPI converts anhydrous ammonia into various ammonium nitrate products. There is the ammonium nitrate process  at the ANPI facility consisting of five interconnected production units: 1) Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area, 2) Nitric Acid Plant AOP3, 3) Nitric Acid Plant AOP4, 4) Ammonium Nitrate Solution (ANS) Plant, and 5) Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant. Additionally, the magazine storage area includes multiple rail spurs located northeast of the ammonium nitrate process. ANPI has two support (i.e., non-production) units that are located apart from the manufacturing process: 6) Brine Concentrator and 7) Powerhouse. For the purposes of this Risk Managemen"

      "SummaryText": "t Plan, the Brine Concentrator and Powerhouse units are not part of the RMP covered process.  Different safeguards apply to different units in the covered process, except for the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area and ANS Plant which share safeguards.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only regulated substance present at the ANPI facility in an amount equal to or greater than the \"threshold quantity\", as defined by 40 CFR Part 68. Anhydrous ammonia is imported to the ANPI facility by railcar and by truck . The railcars and trucks  are unloaded into the Ammonia Unloading and Storage Area. Ammonia then enters into ANPI's Nitric Acid Plants (AOP3 and AOP4). The resulting acid, below the minimum 80% concentration referenced in the RMP rule, feeds into the Neutralizer where it is reacted with more ammonia to produce Ammonium Nitrate Solution. The majority of the ANS is then pumped to the Prilled Ammonium Nitrate Plant where it is concentrated and converted from liquid to solid form. The remaining ANS is either sold directly to customers or converted into fertilizer solutions. ANS is used to produce several liquid fertilizers to serve the seasonal needs of the agricultural industry.\n\n\n\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe potential hazards associated with ANPI's manufacturing process are related to chemical releases, equipment failures, and process upsets. The nature of the hazard is related to the type of event or accident that could occur.\n\n\n\nRelevant onsite or facility hazards associated with the production and support units are reported in this document on a unit-by-unit basis. Major onsite hazards include toxic release; fire; explosion; over pressurization; corrosion; overfilling; contamination; equipment failure; and/or loss of cooling, heating, electricity, or instrument air.\n\n\n\nThe relevant offsite hazard that could impact the local population and environment is also reported in this document. The major offsite haz"

Whether a release of anhydrous ammonia poses a threat to health depends on the concentration of ammonia in the air and the duration of exposure. If individuals remain exposed to high concentrations of ammonia in air for long periods of time, any or all of the following health effects could occur: 1) eye contact: severe irritation, swelling, partial or full blindness; 2) skin contact: severe irritation, blisters; and 3) inhalation: difficulty breathing, lung damage, and death by suffocation.\n\n\n\nANPI's RMP is designed to reduce the number and severity of potential regulated substance releases. This reduces ANPI's risk to offsite receptors near the ANPI facility. At the ANPI facility, the frequency and severity of a regulated substance release is reduced through the implementation of effective prevention, management, mitigation, and emergency response (ER) measures.\n\n\n\nANPI's RMP reduces the likelihood of a regulated substance release by implementing a prevention program. An organizational chart illustrating ANPI's prevention program management system is available.\n\n\n\nANPI's prevention program elements are the same as the requirements for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119). ANPI has qualified employees trained in PSM and has established an organization to assure proper implementation of PSM within the RMP.\n\n\n\nANPI implements a set of twelve management areas designed to protect worker health and safety in the event of accidental releases. To address the hazards of a potential regulated substance release, the following PSM steps are taken at the ANPI facility:\n\n\n\n1. Employee Participation - ANPI consults with its employees on the development of process hazard analysis (PHA) and the development of the other elements of PSM.

Process Safety Information (PSI) - ANPI has established and implements a written program that addresses and controls written PSI on each production and support unit in the manufacturing process. PSI was compiled with respect to the hazard of the chemicals used in the process, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process. ANPI implements good engineering practices for the design, maintenance, inspection, testing, and operation of process equipment.\n\n\n\n3. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) - ANPI has established and implements a written program to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards for each production and support unit in the manufacturing process. ANPI updates and revalidates each PHA at least every 5 years by addressing the items to evaluate in the analyses, deciding the make-up of the PHA team, and resolving PHA findings and recommendations. ANPI retains the PHA record for the life of the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n 4. Operating Procedures (OPs) - ANPI has developed and implements a written program that addresses and controls written OPs process. OPs are consistent with the PSI for each production and support unit in the manufacturing process. OPs address the steps for each operating phase of the manufacturing process, the operating limits, certain safety and health considerations related to the process, and safety systems and their functions. OPs are readily accessible to ANPI employees, reviewed periodically for accuracy, and certified on an annual basis. ANPI has developed and implements safe work practices such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the manufacturing area.\n\n\n\n5.

Contractors - As part of its selection process, ANPI evaluates the safety performance and programs of ANPI contract employees. ANPI informs contractors of process hazards and applicable parts of ANPI's Emergency Response Program (ERP). ANPI has developed and implements safe work practices to control contractor access to the manufacturing process areas. ANPI conducts periodic walk-through inspections to evaluate the safety performance of contractors. ANPI's policy is to hire qualified contractors who are trained to safely perform their jobs and who are knowledgeable in the hazards related to their jobs. The contractor's training is verified by ANPI. Safety rules are strictly enforced at the ANPI facility to ensure that contract employees follow safety rules. ANPI requires contractors to inform ANPI of any unique hazards presented by the contractor's work.\n\n\n\n7. Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) - When a modification requires a change in the PSI, ANPI performs a PSSR for new sources of regulated substances. The PSSR confirms that specific listed items are addressed before a regulated substance is introduced into ANPI's manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n8. Mechanical Integrity - One of the most important prevention program elements is to ensure mechanical integrity.

ANPI's community outreach program:\n\n \n\n    Presents the basic health hazards associated with ammonia \n\n    Explains how you will be notified in the event of an off-plant ammonia release \n\n    Details the shelter-in-place protection procedures \n\n    Provides general information on evacuation, fundamental first aid, decontamination measures, and special assistance needs.\n\n\n\n5.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, there has not been an anhydrous ammonia release from the ANPI facility that meets the regulatory criteria for accident reporting under the RMP rule (40 CFR 68.42). ANPI has had no onsite deaths, injuries, or property damage as a result of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. There have been no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage as a result of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the ANPI facility.\n\n\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nApache Nitrogen maintains a continual improvement process to identify and implement process and/or procedural improvements to our safety program.  Most recently, the Unusual Incident Report (UIR) has been developed and implemented.  As the name implies, the UIR captures unconventional incidents, potentially outside the scope of regulation mandated incidents, which could have a detrimental impact on the safety of workers and/or the public.  Participation in the UIR process is available to, and encouraged among, all Apache employees.  All incidents captured by the UIR process are documented, reviewed, and addressed by Apache Nitrogen senior management. \n\n"
