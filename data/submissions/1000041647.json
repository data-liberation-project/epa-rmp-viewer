This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Devon's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\nWet inlet gas is gathered from wells in the area and sent to Devon's Medford Compressor Station Facility (MCSF) for additional processing prior to sales. This gas contains condensate, liquid hydrocarbons and produced water. Produced feed streams entering an inlet gathering system will inherently drop liquid out in low points in the piping system. Water will have to be removed from these pipelines periodically through a pigging operation. MCSF is equipped with pig receivers to assist in this pigging and dewatering process. Hydrocarbons and water enter this facility at approximately 20-40 psig, liquids are separated in a Slug Catcher and Inlet Separator and are routed to the Low Pressure Drain Header and captured in the Condensate Tanks. Gas is compressed by the Inlet Compressors to processing pressure, and dried in the Glycol Dehydration System.   Hydrocarbon liquids are removed using a mechanical refrigeration process, and residue gas is sent to sales. NGL product is further processed in the Stabilizer Unit to separate any remaining residue gas for sales. The remaining liquid is sent to the NGL Storage Tanks and is loaded on trucks for sales and/or further processing.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief discussion of equipment involved in handling this gas. Gas flows into this facility through two"

These pig receivers are aligned in the piping system to receive an incoming pig when the 16\" inlet and 8\" outlet valves are in the open position. Water/condensate accumulation will increase considerably during pigging. Slug Catcher, SE-1101 is designed to minimize the shock of receiving the pig and to hold additional water/condensate that flows into the facility during pigging operations. Water/condensate is dumped by level control to the Low\r\nPressure Drain Header and is routed to Condensate Tanks, TK-1308 and 1309. Inlet gas continues through a single line to Inlet Separator, SE-1102. Gas exiting the Inlet Separator goes to the suction of both Inlet Compressors. Liquid collected in the Inlet Separator is dumped by level control and is piped to the Low Pressure Drain Header and is routed to Condensate Tanks, TK-1308 and 1309.\r\n\r\nThe gas fired engine driven compression packages are complete with cooling and scrubbing on\r\nall three stages of compression.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nDevon Energy Production Company has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nDevon Energy Production Company primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident s"
