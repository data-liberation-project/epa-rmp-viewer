Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Marine Terminal is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Texas City Marine Terminal is a distribution facility that serves as a major regional distribution hub for Union Carbide products and annually loads and/or unloads more than 6.4 billion pounds of chemical products.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Texas City Marine Terminal, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide Texas City Marine Terminal has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances in quantities above the threshold: \n7 Vinyl Acetate\n7 Ethylenediamine\n\nThe terminal has the following RMP-regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold:\n7 1,3-Butadiene\n7 Propylene\n\n3.    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The terminals general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nVinyl Acetate: This scenario assumes that a failure of a field storage tank of vinyl acetate releases 23,000,000 pounds of vinyl acetate as a liquid. According to EPAs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following passive mitigation is used in this analysis:\n7 Diking: The diking around the storage tank is designed to contain the liquid release. \nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Equipment Design and Construction: Design and construction codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n7 Piping: Piping is welded to minimize the number of flanges.\n7 Surveillance: The process is monitored by computers and trained, certified operators.\n7 Emergency Response Plans: Emergency response plans are current and drills are performed and critiqued.\n7 Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment: An Emergency Director is on site and trained emergency responders and mobile fire protection equipment available.\n7 Foam: Foam is used by the Emergency Response team to minimize vapor releases. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \nVinyl Acetate: This scenario assumes that a leak develops in a transfer line due to a weld crack or gasket failure releasing 6,180 pounds of vinyl acetate liquid.

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Texas City Marine Terminal maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Marine Terminal maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the  emergency squad, Union Carbide's Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team responds to accidental releases from transportation incidents occurring in the continental U.S.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Texas City/La Marque Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\n\n\n7.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nOn-going programs, such as process hazard analysis reevaluations, continually aim to improve process safety.  The following is a list of specific impro"
