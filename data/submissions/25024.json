This program consists of policies and procedures for responding to releases, including actions to be taken in the event of a fire, explosion, or chemical release. These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, personnel accountability plans, notification requirements to St. Charles Parish OEP and the public in the event of a release, post-incident cleanup and area decontamination requirements. In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to Resins processes.  The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change.  All the above actions of the emergency response program are undertaken by Resolution Performance Products through a service agreement with Shell. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility.

Epichlorohydrin is the only RMP regulated substance stored or processed in amounts greater than threshold quantity in the Shipping/Loading area.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) SCENARIOS\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenarios (WCS) and alternative release scenarios (ARS) involving toxic and flammable substances at Resolution Performance Products LLC.  The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it neither reflects actual operating conditions nor allows credit for all mitigation measures in place.  On the other hand, the ARS is a more realistic scenario, which takes into account actual operating conditions and applicable mitigation measures.\n\nThe following are brief summaries of the Worst Case and Alternate Release scenarios at Resolution Performance Products, including information on mitigation control measures, which can reduce potential offsite impact.  All OCA release modeling was performed using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (USEPA) RMP*Comp offsite consequence analysis program.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps and the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census, LandView\u00e4 III Environmental Mapping Software (1997).\n\n1. Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario \u00bf Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case toxic release scenario is an instantaneous failure of a storage vessel that results in a release of 250,000 lbs. of chlorine over a 10-minute period. The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  The vessel was assumed to be 25% filled, which is the normal le"

Alternative Toxic Release Scenario - Epichlorohydrin (ECH)\n\nThe alternate release scenario for ECH involves a 46,000 lb. release of ECH from a 1.5 inch flange leak during rail car unloading. This scenario was selected because of the release proximity to offsite receptors. The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  ECH rail cars are pressurized with nitrogen to unload the ECH into tank storage.  The scenario assumes a 15 minute release based on operator surveillance to detect the release, stop nitrogen flow to the rail car, and apply water to the affected area with area firewater monitors to mitigate the release.  Passive mitigation consists of a 400 square foot containment dike.  The distance to toxic endpoint (0.076 mg/L based on the AIHA ERPG-2 level) was calculated at 0.1 miles (528 ft.).  A population estimate of 45-50 people offsite, including residential public receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.\n\n4. Worst Case Scenario - Flammable Mixture\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a flammable release assumes the catastrophic failure, release, and vapor cloud explosion of 82,000 lbs. of propylene in a column.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  No passive mitigation (i.e. containment) credit was applied to the release calculation.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 0.3 miles (1,584 ft.).  A population estimate of 45-50 people offsite, including residential, recreational, religious, school and commercial public receptors could be potentially affected by the release.

A population estimate of 283,934 people offsite, including residential, religious, recreational, hospital, school, prison, commercial, and environmental receptors could be potentially affected by the release.\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for mechanical safety systems on worst-case scenarios, there are various prevention measures that significantly reduce the potential risk and impact of the worst-case scenario.  These measures include:\n\n- Mechanical integrity inspection and preventive maintenance programs\n- A perimeter chlorine detection system\n- Critical instrument systems with audible and visual alarms\n- Automatic isolation valves\n- An emergency containment system\n- Routine surveillance by trained operators\n- Normal operating limits of storage vessel maintained at 20-30% of capacity. \n\n2. Alternative Toxic Release Scenario \u00bf Chlorine\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a 6,150 lb. release from a 1/16 gasket leak on a 6 pipeline orbit valve.  This scenario was selected because of the release proximity to offsite receptors.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the proximity of congested process areas and buildings.  The release is assumed to last 1minute, from the time of detection to complete mitigation.  Mitigation measures include detection by area chlorine monitors, activation of alarms and automatic isolation valve, initiation of emergency notification procedures, operator intervention to activate a firewater monitor and activation of pipeline emergency purge procedures.  The distance to toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L based on the AIHA ERPG-2 level) was calculated at 0.9 miles (4,752 ft.).  A population estimate of 641 people offsite, including residential, religiou"

On 13 December 2000, an HCl absorber column ruptured after a minor plant upset.  The column was one of two columns in HCl absorber service.  They operate in parallel and are both constructed of fiberglass reinforced plastic with a PVDF liner.  The column rupture was caused by a cracked vessel liner.  The liner was damaged through thermal and mechanical stresses associated with transient startup conditions.  The cracked liner permitted HCl from the process to deteriorate the fiberglass reinforcing in the column until it could no longer retain operating pressure.  As a result of this incident, 2200 pounds of propylene was released.  This incident did not result in any on-site or off-site impacts.  However, the Louisiana State Police, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, and St. Charles Parish EOC were notified.  The Louisiana state Police responded to the incident. \n\nThe failed column was repaired by removing the damaged section and replacing it with new FRP material.  The entire column was then re-wrapped with FRP to provide a wall thickness double that of the original column.  The second HCl absorber column was inspected and determined to be in good condition.  Both the columns"
