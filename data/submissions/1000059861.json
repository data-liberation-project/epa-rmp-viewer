      "SummaryText": "The 3A Composites facility in Glasgow, Kentucky is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, the Glasgow facility has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Pentane and 1,1 difluoroethane (152a) Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68 and with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  The facility has complied with the OSHA PSM standard since 1993.\n\n\n\nPentane is stored on site in a 30,000 gallon tank.  152a is stored in a 5,300 gallon tank and a 6500 gallon tank.  Pentane and 152a are both used to produce foam that is either laminated or non-laminated.  The foam that is laminated with paper is sold for use in the graphic arts industry and construction market.  \n\n\n\nIn order to minimize the potential for release, the facility has developed detailed procedures for handling Pentane and 152a.  The facility also proactively maintains the components of these systems by conducting nondestructive testing of the storage tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures are detected before they occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility has had no accidents relating to PSM/RMP in the last five years that resulted in injuries or property damage.\n\n\n\nIf there is an incident with Pentane or 152a that results in a fire, the facility will immediately contact the fire department.  The facility has coordinated emergency response actions with the fire department.  Facility personnel will not provide emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe facility recently held a Process Hazard Analysis on 1/5/16.  "
