Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Storage and Terminal facility management for resolution.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC, (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal located in Apache County, Arizona is owned by Enterprise Products Operating LLC, and is operated by Enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal facility is a bulk hydrocarbon storage and handling facility. The facility receives propane, butane; pentane and mixed refinery grade butane (RGB) liquids either by rail car or transport truck and stores these liquids in one of ten active underground storage caverns. These liquids are stored until needed and are then shipped back out of the facility to wholesale customers.  Normal butane is shipped out exclusively by railcar. The other liquid products stored at Adamana are shipped out either by railcar or transport truck. A number of surge tanks are on site at the facility to receive products prior to subsequent pumping into the storage caverns. A solid bed propane dehydrator is used to provide dehydration for stored propane product prior to truck or railcar loading.  An iso-butane / normal butane splitter unit is also available for on-site fractionation of refinery grade butane (RGB) products on a batch basis.  The fractionation facility is currently isolated and shut down. Should fa"

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Adamana Storage and Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Storage and Terminal facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform Storage and Terminal facility personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.
