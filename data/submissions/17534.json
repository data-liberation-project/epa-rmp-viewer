The plant trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\nJ) Employee Participation\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant developed a written employee participation program for the covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant's workers are addressed.  The plant encourages active participation of personnel in the prevention program activities at the plant.  Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\n\nK) Hot Work Permits\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant established a hot work permit program to control spark or flame- producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against a release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\nEquistar's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered.  When a hazardous substance is used, Equistar considers the potential for this substance which could adversely affect the plant workers, the public and the environment through the management of change and the process hazard analysis processes and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nEquistar strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility: Equistar implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used, the equipment is carefully designed, built, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment. Equistar uses Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval.  In addition, Equistar requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and the training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the management of change process.

In reality, however, Equistar does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  \n\nEPA Look-Up Tables were used for evaluating the distance to 1 psi overpressure for the flammable WCS.  To model the alternative releases, the TRACE modeling program was used.  Equistar's Lake Charles plant uses an onsite SAFER Real Time system for emergency response determination.  TRACE, which is a model based on the same dispersion principles as SAFER, is the model of choice for the consequence analysis.  The meteorological data used for the WCS modeling was the EPA default data, and weather conditions used for the ACS were those typical for the Lake Charles area obtained from review of past weather history.

This review confirms that:\n\n7 Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\n7 Adequate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\n7 Employee training has been completed   \n7 For a covered process, that management of change requirements have been completed.\n\nA pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\nH) Compliance Audit\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant audits the covered process to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues of operating the plant.  The plant assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process, and this team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP"

      "SummaryText": "the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors' train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker can begin work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\n\n5) The five-year accident history (' 68.155e):\n \nThe facility experienced an accidental release of propylene and methane on July 6, 1994 when a leak developed on a piece of operating equipment.  The release did not find an ignition source and was subsequently isolated.  The release resulted in the replacement of the existing equipment, but did not result in any other additional on-site or off-site impact.  No off-site response or assistance was required. Revisions were made to the operating procedures, mitigation systems, emergency response plan, and the equipment design as a result of the incident.\n \n6) The emergency response program (' 68.155f):\n \nThe Equistar Lake Charles Plant emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the following regulations:\n \n7 OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 (a) - Employee Emergency Action Plans\n7 OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 (n) - Process Safety Management Of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\n7 OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (p) and (q) -  Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)\n7 OSHA 29 CFR 1910, Subpart L - Fire Protection\n7 LADEQ LAC 33.1'3901 - Notification Regulations for Unauthorized Discharges\n7 LDPS Title 33, Part V, Subpart 2.

Fixed fire protection systems are designed to National Petroleum Refiners Association (NPRA) guidelines.  The plant has an Emergency Response Team on each shift, available 24 hours per day, to respond and initiate response actions to contain, control and if possible mitigate the release.  The team has access to on site emergency equipment, which are appropriate for the anticipated emergency situations and capabilities of Equistar personnel.  The following is a listing of some of the equipment, which is available for emergency response:\n \n7 2500 gallon per minute / 70 foot Aerial Pumper Truck\n7 HAZMAT / OPA 90 Response Trailer\n7 Rescue / Medical Response Vehicle\n7 21,000 gallon per minute Firewater System\n7 Mobile Incident Command Trailer\n \nQuarterly drills are conducted to assess and evaluate the emergency response effort at the Lake Charles Plant.  If assistance is required during an emergency response, the Southwest Louisiana Mutual Aid Association would be activated and requested to provide additional resources as necessary.\n\nThe Lake Charles Plant uses a SAFER Real Time modeling system to assess release impacts if any and to aid in the determination of response activity.  The Lake Charles Plant has a community alert (CAL) system available through the Office of Emergency Preparedness to notify the public of a potential or actual hazardous situation.
