      "SummaryText": "The Cabot Corporation site in Carrollton, Kentucky, is located on approximately 7.5 acres and manufactures amorphous fumed silica.  The site employs a total of 31 employees, both full and part time, conducting operations 24-hours a day.  Fumed silica produced by the site is utilized in several end-use products, supplying various markets such as the automotive and construction industries, household goods, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical products.\n\n\n\nRMP APPLICABILITY \n\n\n\nThe Cabot Corporation Carrollton site is subject to Program 3 RMP requirements for toxics due to the following:\n\n1.    RMP substance above the threshold quantities within a stationary source\n\n          -The substance methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) is processed within a stationary source at a quantity which exceeds the 5,000lb threshold.\n\n          -The stationary source is a steam jacketed liquid vaporizer.\n\n2.    Public and Private receptors within the worst-case release endpoint\n\n3.    Process at the site is covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nBoth accidental and general accidental releases are prevented at the site via adherence to policies and procedures as well as routine, appropriate employee training.  A formal Emergency Response Program is detailed within a separate document maintained and controlled by the Safety, Heath, and Environmental Manager. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nThis is the initial RMP submittal for the Cabot Corporation Carrollton site.  To date, there have been no accidents involving MTCS within the last five years.\n\n\n\nSAFETY IMPROVEMENT\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Cabot Corporation Carrollton site require that certain materials used are potentially harmful if the appropriate safeguards and work practices are not implemented.  Employee safety and the safe use of these chemicals is the highest priority for all site personnel.  Continuous improvement is "
