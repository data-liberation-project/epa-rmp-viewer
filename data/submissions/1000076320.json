The natural gas liquid (NGL) is an RMP-regulated flammable mixture. Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119). Public receptors are not located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant. Therefore, the Midmar West Plant is subject to Program 1 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. \n\n\n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Midmar West Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor. \n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant employs 4 full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility. \n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant maintains a policy of safe natural gas liquid extraction operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the separation processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment. \n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a natural gas liquid release.\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant stores and processes the following RMP-regulated substances: natural gasoline, natural gas liquids (NGL) and propane. NGL is a flammable mixture that contains propane, ethane, N-butane, isobutane, isopentane, N-pentane, and methane.  The stationary source determined to provide the worst case scenario is the Product Surge Tank. The Product Surge Tank contains NGLs. Ethane was used as the flammable in this scenario due to it being the only regulated flammable that exists in the mixture above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of ethane. The Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. The Midmar West Plant's general accidental release prevention program  and chemical specific prevention ste are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document. Required elements include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation; \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information; \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis;\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures;\n\n\n\nTraining;\n\n\n\nContractors; \n\n\n\nPre-startup Review; \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity; \n\n\n\nHot Work Permits;\n\n\n\nManagement of Change; \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation; and \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant is a new RMP regulated facility and as such has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Midmar West Plant maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that provides guidance for emergencies expec"

The ERP addresses all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the Facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.
