Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, and neighbors.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe ProMix Fractionator is owned by K/D/S ProMix, LLC, which is a partnership owned by Dow Chemical and Enterprise Products Partners.  Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (Enterprise) id the operator of the plant.\n\n\n\nAt the facility, the plant receives natural gas liquids (NGL) as feedstock from natural gas processing facilities.  The incoming plant feed is fed directly into the plant from an incoming pipeline.  This feedstock is treated (for removal of CO2) prior to entering the fractionation process.  This is accomplished by an Amine system, which uses a Diethanolamaine and Methyldiethanolamine mixture to remove the CO2.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has a capability to fractionate the feedstock into six product streams:\n\n\n\n    Purity Ethane\n\n      Ethane/Propane (E-P) Mix\n\n    Propane\n\n    Iso-Butane\n\n    "

The fractionated hydrocarbon products listed above are flammable substances regulated under the RMP regulation.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of the RMP is to provide information about our operations, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, our emergency response plans in case of an accidental release, our five-year accident history and our planned changes to improve safety at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe operations at the Pro Mix Fractionation Plant were reviewed to determine the toxic and flammable hazardous materials that are present on site that are covered by the EPA Risk Management Program.   These hazardous materials are as follows:\n\n\n\nToxics\n\n\n\nNo toxic materials to report.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nListed flammable substances which are handled or stored above the threshold quantities at the ProMix Fractionation Plant are raw make (Y-Grade Product), purity ethane, ethane/propane mix, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.
