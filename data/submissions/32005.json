      "SummaryText": "The City of Donna Water Filtration Plant accidental release prevention policy  approach integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. The Donna emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Donna\u00bfs Water Filtration Plant is located at 801 South Hutto Road, Donna, Hildalgo County, Texas.\n\n Its chlorination building houses six, 1-ton chlorine cylinders and consists of a three-walled, canopy structure facing north, and located on the south side of the facility. Two operational 1-ton cylinders within the walled, canopied structure are connected at any given time. One is in operation and the other is for backup. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of released chlorine. Personnel oversee the facility 8-hours a day, including daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage occupies locations in the office approximately 100 feet from the chlorination building. \n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Donna's Fire and Police Departments reviewed the facility's emergency response program. Both departments are members of the Hidalgo County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills, drill evaluations, and emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed annually."
