This water treatment plant is owned by Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) wich is a Geverment Agency. PRASA has developed the RMP following the Program #3 for the Management and Prevention of Risks associated with the storage and handling of the toxic substanve used as for water disinfection: Chlorine. The RMP was prepared in compliance with EPA 40 CFR Part 68. The Prevention Program was prepeared in accordance with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, as established in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.   .                                                                                                                                                                          Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is PRASA's policy to comply with EPA and OSHA Federal and State applicable requirements.  Chlorine, is a toxic substance regulated by EPA, for that reason La Plata-Aibonito Filtration Plant is already observing many engineering controls.Changes have been put in place to improve security and as a part of the Prevention Plan implemented to protect the wellness of workers, employees, contractors, visitors and immediately surrounding areas and inhabitants.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe La Plata-Aibonito Water Filtration Plant is located close to the area where tha plants supply the potable water. The chlorine is used as a disinfectant to destroy micoorganism that could cause illness in humans. The chlorine is delivered from PRASA's Storage Center in Puerto Nuevo to the plant in one (1) ton containers. La Plata-Aibonito Plant could have a maximum volume of 12,000 pounds distributed in six (6) containers. The containers are connected to vacumm chlorinators which the chlorine flows to the injectors.and then the chlorinated water is sent to two (2) different injections points"

This guidanceconsiders the release of chlorine Gas of the entire container (2,000 pounds) during 10 minutes and other secifications related to the conditions and a radio of 1.3 miles, for a chlorine  concentration equal or higher than 3 ppm, wich is the American Industrial Hygine Association exposure limit above wich it is determined human health will be affected. Using Landview 6 Simulator and the CENSUS 2000, it was identified that 1969 residents are inside the 1.3 radio. No known environmental receptors (state, parks or official designated wildlife preserves) are located within this radio area. The ALOHA Modeling Dispersion Program was used to simulate the gas dispersion.\n\nEPA requires the determination of the area (zone of vulnerability) which may be exposed to a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm or greater.  According to the American Industrial Hygiene Association, 3 ppm is the maximum concentration of chlorine in air below which nearly all people could be exposed for one hour without serious health effects.  Based on the worst-case assumptions, the zone of vulnerability was determined to extend 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area.                                                             .                                                                                                                                                                          Alternative Case Scenario:\n  \nThe more realistic  scenario was also simulated as per Wastewater Tratment Plants parameters, as a release of the total content of a 2,000 punds container, but throughout a pipe leak. In the case the end point distance is calculated at 0.1 miles and 46 public receptors were identified over the most rece"

      "SummaryText": "nt map. No know environmental receptors are located within the radio area.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nPRASA is actually in a very aggressive opration to implement a Prevention Plan to ensure the maintenace and mechanical inegrity of the facility wich will improve significantly the safety scope of the current prevention plans. Standard Operational Procedures (SOP's) are already in place to comply with OSHA and PROSHO requirements in order to keep all the involved parties aware of the hazardous risk realated to chlorine. List of all SOP's are indicated in the PSM report and are located in the plant.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nPRASA  has various SOP's to manage emergency response programs associated to a release of the chemical and also related to the emergency actions to be taken before and after hurricanes and other atmospherics events.  \n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n No mayor release of chlorine in excess of ten pounds has been reported during the last five years.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRASA has implemented in La Plata-Aibonito Filtration Plant, a vacuumm operated system to improve the control of the process and the safety of the chlorine handling and storage. It is still needed to reinforced administrative activities related to containers handling and transportation, employee's training, preventive maintenace and audits. Recommendations were given on that regard on last PHA dated 12/07/2007."
