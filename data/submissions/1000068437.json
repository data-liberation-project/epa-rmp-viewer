EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOperating in a safe and responsible manner is a core value and an integral part of CF Industries. Our safety strategy revolves around our \"Do It Right\" value and permeates our business in three key ways:\n\n? Robust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\n\n? Superior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\n\n? Engaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\n\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\n\n\n\nVERDIGRIS NITROGEN FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Verdigris Nitrogen Facility manufactures anhydrous ammonia, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution, and other nitrogen products.  Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include nitric acid, urea solution, and ammonium nitrate solution.  An ancillary substance that is present at the facility is chlorine. The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine, and flammable mixture. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Verdigris Nitrogen Facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:  \n\n? Process safety information that is accurate and up to date;\n\n? Well-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\n\n? Written operating procedures;\n\n? Me"

Coordination with local emergency and fire responders;\n\n? Stringent design standards of equipment which incorporate substantial safety factors and include state of the art monitoring and control instrumentation; and\n\n? Formal policies for contractor management\n\n\n\nThis facility is also a participant in the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) to promote effective worksite-based safety and health and have qualified for VPP Star status, which is recognition for exemplary achievement in the prevention and control of occupational safety and health hazards and the development, implementation and continuous improvement of safety and health management systems. Approval into VPP is OSHA's official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThis facility has not had any accidental releases subject to EPA 40 CFR Part 68, within the last five years. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIn accordance with a June 14, 2018 determination by EPA Region 7, the Verdigris Nitrogen facility, is designated as a \"non-responding\" facility, and the information specified in Section 9.

The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperation with emergency responders and local officials, recognition programs and participation in industry safety initiatives help keep our focus on what it takes to \"Do It Right.\" Through our ongoing commitment to make our facility as safe as possible for employees, contractors, the community, and the environment, we are always continuously improving our systems and practices. \n\n\n\n"
