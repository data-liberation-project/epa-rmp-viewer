EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nOperating in a safe and responsible manner is a core value and an integral part of CF Industries. Our safety strategy revolves around our Do It Right value and permeates our business in three key ways:\r\n\u00bf Robust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\r\n\u00bf Superior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\r\n\u00bf Engaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\r\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\r\n\r\nVERDIGRIS NITROGEN FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Verdigris Nitrogen Facility manufactures anhydrous ammonia, urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) solution, and other nitrogen products.  Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include nitric acid, urea solution, and ammonium nitrate solution.  An ancillary substance that is present at the facility is chlorine. The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia, chlorine, and flammable mixture. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe Verdigris Nitrogen Facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with all of the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements as set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119. The following summarizes the elements of the release and chemical-specific prevention that are in place at our facility:  \r\n\u00bf Process safety information that is accurate and up to date;\r\n\u00bf Well-trained operating, maintenance, and contract personnel;\r\n\u00bf Written operating procedures;\r\n\u00bf Me"

Approval into VPP is OSHA's official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThis facility has not had any accidental releases subject to EPA 40 CFR Part 68, within the last five years. \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nIn accordance with a June 14, 2018 determination by EPA Region 7, the Verdigris Nitrogen facility, is designated as a non-responding facility, and the information specified in Section 9.

      "SummaryText": "e ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all federal, state, and local laws are complied with. The ERP is a definitive plan that assigns responsibilities, defines several different methods of communication, designates evacuation procedures, and coordinates with outside assistance. The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that employees are required to have depending on their responsibilities. Furthermore, the plan commits the company's management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nRigorous training, drills, audits, cooperation with emergency responders and local officials, recognition programs and participation in industry safety initiatives help keep our focus on what it takes to Do It Right. Through our ongoing commitment to make our facility as safe as possible for employees, contractors, the community, and the environment, we are always continuously improving our systems and practices."
