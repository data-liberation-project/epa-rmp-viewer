If an emergency involving formaldehyde were to occur, the facility's policy is to notify the Winnsboro Fire Department if outside assistance is necessary.               \n\nFacility Description & Regulated Substance:\nThis facility manufactures textile material which is supplied to other facilities for use in tire manufacturing.  Formaldehyde (37% solution) is an ingredient in a textile treatment dip solution which is applied to a woven fabric.  The formaldehyde process consists of one 5,000 gallon storage tank and associated equipment. The tank and other equipment are located inside the manufacturing building.  \n                                                                                                                                           \nWorst-case Release Scenario:\nThe worst-case release scenario of the 37% formaldehyde solution is the complete discharge of a full tank (5000 gallons) through the loading pipe and onto the outside loading pad area.  In this most unlikely scenario, the release would be mitigated by a raised curb around the unloading area pad and stormwater sewers.  According to EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables, this release could result in a hazard zone of up to 0.3 miles (1584 feet) which could impact several residences located near the facility.  (Note:  If the formaldehyde tank itself ruptured and the contents spilled out, they would be contained in a dike around the tank inside the manufacturing building, and this would result in a lower potential release rate than a discharge of the tank contents through the loading pipe to the outside loading pad area).  \n\nAlternative (More Likely) Scenario:\nThe more likely scenario, if there were any incident, would be a small release from a hose failure when offloading the material f"

According to EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables, a release of this caliber could result in a very limited hazard zone of up to 528 ft, which could possibly impact some of the facility's nearest neighbors.  However, considering the precautions that are taken by personnel during the offloading process and the spill prevention and response program in place at the facility, a release of this nature is unlikely to actually occur.  Historically, such a release has never occurred.\n\nPrevention Program:\nThis facility complies with EPA's Risk Management rule and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  Additionally, the storage tank and process are located inside the building to prevent releases to the environment.  The process is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with OSHA's PSM and good engineering practices.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nThe facility has never had an accident involving formaldehyde that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe facility has a spill prevention and response procedure in place, which includes employee training and coordination with local emergency response.  In the event of an emergency requiring assistance, it is the facility's policy to notify the Winnsboro Municipal and Fairfield County  Fire Departments and request that they respond to the emergency.  This policy has been discussed with the fire department."
