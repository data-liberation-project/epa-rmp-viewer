The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive annual training in these procedures to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant also maintains a volunteer fire brigade comprised of plant employees for the purpose of prevention, controlling/containing and suppressing industrial fires or chemicals releases.  The Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant is a member of the Baytown Exxon Emergency Response Network (BEERN) and the Channel Industries Mutual Aid group (CIMA).

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR\nEXXON CHEMICAL BAYTOWN OLEFINS PLANT\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \n\nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant (BOP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by its' continuing participation in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Program, as well as through the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  In 1993, BOP was awarded the coveted STAR recognition by OSHA for excellence in occupational safety and health.  Continued membership as a STAR site requires continuous improvement in each of 19 rigorous elements, with periodic recertifications by OSHA.  In 1996, BOP was recertified as a STAR site and we are currently preparing for our second recertification in 2000.  Key elements of the VPP program include Hazard Assessment, Employee Participation, Management Commitment and Involvement, Process Safety Management, Incident Analysis and recommendation follow-up to completion.  Our objective is to implement effective controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nExxon Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems"

They went on to say, We further believe Exxon to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\nThis Executive Summary describes the following: Stationary Source, Hazard Assessment Results, Accident Release Prevention Program Elements, Chemical Specific Prevention Steps, Five-Year Accident History, Emergency Response Program, Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Community Communication.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n \nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant is located in Baytown, Harris County, Texas.  It operates to produce a variety of chemical intermediate feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene, and butadiene.  The plant has several regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and butenes.  In addition, the plant uses chlorine, which is a regulated substance under this Rule.  The entire plant is considered one covered process for purposes of this plan.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS \n\nThe hazard assessments were done using the EPA supplied look up tables and equations.   These tables and equations cover all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate case (ACS) scenarios.\n\nThe WCS associated with toxic substances at our plant is a potential release of chlorine from a shipping cylinder that has a potential off-site impact. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should one occur, EPA allowed no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures to be taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  Chlorine cylinders are stored in two locations  approximately 1/4 mile apart.  Since the scenario circles are offset by 1/4 mile and could potentially affect slightly different population groups, two potential worst case scenarios are included in the plan.  The only difference between the two scenarios is the loca"

This scenario does factor in the safety measures that we have in place; including chlorine monitors, frequent inspections and detailed operating and maintenance procedures that would minimize the likelihood and magnitude of any potential release.  As a result, this scenario could only impact an industrial right of way.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at our plant is a potential vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a refrigerated storage tank containing a covered flammable, in our case a mixture of 1,3-Butadiene and other C4's.  The full tank inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences should one occur, EPA allowed no credit for mitigation to be taken into account in evaluating this WCS. This WCS has a potential off-site endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario for flammable substances involves a leak from a failed piping flange gasket with subsequent explosion. This scenario does factor in the safety measures that we have in place; including hydrocarbon monitors, frequent inspections and detailed operating and maintenance procedures that would minimize the likelihood and magnitude of any potential release.  As a result, this scenario could only impact an industrial neighbor plant.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS \n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant.

Further, as already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this Risk Management Plan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  To minimize rework, we selected May 1, 1999, as the date to begin collecting this information.  Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, a key thrust of the OSHA VPP program.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, a number of initiatives are under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personnel safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe op"

Specific groups within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the plant has identified Operating Envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

In addition, new projects that add new facilities are analyzed as part of the design process to ensure that the controls necessary to adequately manage the hazards associated with these new facilities are installed as part of the project.\n\nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by Exxon Research and Engineering and Exxon Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated (called a Process Hazard Analysis, or PHA, team).  The PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results, as well as tracks changes through the management of change system (discussed below).  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and re"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  \n\nThe plant has identified operating envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations and mechanical technicians periodically receive refresher training on the procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the chemical plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) \n\nThe Exxon Baytown Olefins Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information and therefore, is controlled by management of change (MOC).  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.
