Other processing operations at this facility include fresh cherry packing, dark sweet cherry processing, and frozen dark sweet cherry process.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brines that preserve, firm and bleach the cherries.  This process is essential to optimize uses for the growers' fruit and preserve cherry quality.  Fresh and frozen products are stored in cold room and freezers using Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant.  Our mission is to produce the highest quality cherry products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public and the environment.\n\nTo assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Oregon Cherry Growers has a long standing safety program that includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and implroved if possible.  Increased security measures have also been taken to secure railcars and protect operators during operations.  Process team members assist in the annual update of our procedures and safety information.  There have been no reportable releases of Sulfur Dioxide or Ammonia in the last 10 years.\n\nTo assure that Ammonia is handled safely, only trained refrigeration mechanics operate our refrigeration systems.  Our safety program for Ammonia also includes annual training for all operators, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing followup to assure that safe practices are followed.  Both the Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonia systems have instrumentation and emergency shut off systems in place to prevent releases.  \n\nTo assure accidental releases are"

      "SummaryText": " prevented, Oregon Cherry Growers has a continuing safety program for Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonia.  All process procedures are written and closely monitored by trained qualified employees.  Process monitoring methods include checklists for operations, regular equipment inspections, documented preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity inspections.  Additional security measures have also been put in place in compliance with changes in security regulations.  Oregon Cherry Growers maintains a stringent operator training program to keep operators alert to safe operations.  Emergency response activities are reviewed and updated annually.  Emergency response training is included in pre-harvest training activities.\n\nPlanned improvements include security upgrades for the facility, additional coordinated training with local emergency response agencies,  and applying the principles of continuous imporvement to all chemical handling processes.  All improvements are documented and reviewed with the process team prior to implementation."
