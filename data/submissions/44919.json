Executive Summary\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis plan has been revised and is being resubmitted according to 40 CFR 68.190(b)(5) due to recent changes that required a revised PHA or hazard review.  These changes include the startup of the Gasoline Desulfurization Unit (GDU) and the conversion of the Heavy Cat Naphtha Hydrotreater (HCNHT) to a Kero Hydrotreater (KHT) in June 2005, and the startup of the Coker Gas Plant and Boiler 401D in October 2005.  \n\nThe St. Charles Refinery is owned and operated by Valero Refining-New Orleans, LLC, formerly owned and operated by Orion Refining Corporation.  The St. Charles Refinery is currently operating its Crude Unit, Vacuum Unit, Delayed Coking Unit, Milli-Second Catalytic Cracker (MSCC), Gasoline Desulfurization Unit (GDU), Alkylation Unit, three Hydrodesulfurization Units, two Sulfur Units and associated utilities facilities.  \n\nThe purpose of this plan is to provide information about regulated substances and release scenarios at the facility, policies and programs to prevent accidental releases, emergency response planning, accident history and planned changes to improve safety at the facility.  Each of these aspects are summarized below and fully detailed in the RMP.  \n\nRegulated Substances and Release Scenarios\n\nThe St. Charles Refinery has six flammable substances in amounts estimated to exceed the thresholds for covered substances.  They are Propane, Propylene/Propane mix, Butane, Isobutane, Butylene/Butane mix, and LPG.  There has been no change in the quantities of these regulated flammab"

      "SummaryText": "le substances in the facility from the previous RMP submittal.\n\nUsing the worst-case scenario specified for flammables by the EPA, a vapor cloud explosion of the largest vessel containing a regulated flammable substance, the Butylene/Butane sphere, would have the greatest impact.  Using the EPA model known as RMPComp (version 1.07), the distance impacted by such an explosion was calculated to be 1.4 miles.  Although numerous in-place controls prevent such an event from occurring, none of those controls are considered in modeling the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe alternate release scenario was identified based on a review of existing Process Hazard Analysis documentation.  A flange leak at the Propylene/Propane vessel was calculated to have the greatest off site impact by affecting up to 0.3 miles from the vessel.  No residential areas are located in the area of impact; however, a neighboring chemical facility would be affected if this scenario occurred.  A strategically placed isolation valve, an in-place water curtain safety feature, on site presence of a fire brigade, operator intervention, and other Emergency Response Team actions will reduce the distance of impact.\n\nPrevention Policies and Programs\n\nThe St. Charles Refinery operates under the strict guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Facility personnel strive for excellence in PSM by thoroughly integrating PSM into the organization's culture.  The PSM program is designed to:\n\n* Reduce the potential for serious accidents\n\n* Increase plant reliability, efficiency and product quality\n\n* Diminish the potential for releases with environmental impact\n\nEmergency Response Planning\n\nThe St. Charles Refinery has its own Emergency Response Team (ERT) to respond to all on site emergencies.  This team would coordinate with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) personnel during any incident with potential for off site impacts"

      "SummaryText": ".  Copies of the Emergency Response Plan as well as ERT planning activities and exercises are coordinated with the DEP Director on an ongoing basis.\n\nAccident History\n\nTwo reportable accidents related to RMP substances have occurred at the facility in the past five years.  The first incident occurred on June 7, 2001 as a result of a lightning strike on an oil storage tank.  The lightning strike resulted in an on-site fire, with a release of 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.  Property damage was estimated to be over one million dollars while the off-site impacts included the sheltering in place of Parish Water Works personnel.\n\nThe second accident resulted in an on-site fire in the Coker Unit.  This accident occurred on January 29, 2003.  Coking is a severe method of thermal cracking used to upgrade heavy residuals into lighter products or distillates.  Coking produces straight-run gasoline (coker naphtha), diesel (light coker distillate), and a heavy distillate fraction used as catalytic cracking feedstock.  The fire in the coker unit was due to a pipeline failure resulting in release of hot heavy oil, with auto ignition of the product.  Damage on-site was estimated to be over one million dollars.  Off-site impacts included temporarily closing two adjacent roads.  Environmental monitoring during this event indicated no hazardous air pollutants present offsite.  To limit the recurrence of coker unit fires, Valero Refinery has made improvements and upgrades to the affected equipment and revised the maintenance and inspection procedures.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nContinuing compliance with PSM/RMP guidelines and regulations forms the basis of the refinery's commitment to ensuring a safe working environment for employees as well as a safe community.  The facility benefits from the use of the latest technology in its processes as well as the assurance of the finest training of its employees.  Specific actions that will improve safety include:\n\n?

Use of process controls such as vents, relief valves, check valves, scrubbers, flares, shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypasses, emergency air and power supplies, backup pumps, grounding equipment, quench and purge systems and rupture disks to prevent or minimize releases\n\n? Use of mitigation systems such as sprinkler systems, deluge systems, water curtains and neutralization to reduce the impacts of any accidental releases\n\n? Use of process area detectors to quickly identify and respond to emergencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII.  Data Elements\n\n\n\nThe following Risk Management Plan is a copy of the submittal to EPA and was created using RMP Submit 2004.  RMP Submit 2004 is the electronic submittal program prepared by EPA for use by all facilities required to report under the RMP regulation.\n\nRMP Submit 2004 requires certain information concerning the Offsite Consequence Analysis, Five-Year Accident History, Emergency Response Program and Prevention Program.  This section presents the information as it was submitted to EPA.  For a more detailed account of the information required by RMP Submit 2004, please see the data elements in the Documentation Section of this manual, under the tab labeled ?Risk Management Plan ? Data Elements.?\n\nThe Data Elements are the same elements required to be completed when preparing the electronic submission form.  The EPA version of the data elements has been modified by adding ?Source? and ?Rationale? columns.  These columns have been added to explain where the information given in that particular data element was found (Source) and the reasoning behind an answer to a particular data element (Rationale), if an explanation was needed.  These two extra columns will not be reported to EPA in the Risk Management Plan submission.  They are for the facility?s information and use.\n\nThe USGS "

      "SummaryText": "topographic maps in scales of 1:100,000 and 1:24,000 have been included as documentation of public and environmental receptors.  The 1:100,000 scale maps were used when the distance to the endpoint was fairly large (such as a 25 mile radius for a toxic worst case scenario).  1:24,000 scale maps were used when the distance to endpoint was not more than 5 miles.\n\nThe maps have been reviewed to determine what receptors (schools, hospitals, etc.) were within the distance to the endpoint.  The presence of various categories of receptors is recorded in the Risk Management Plan.\n\nIncluded in this documentation are LandViewTM printouts indicating population within the distance to endpoint.  LandViewTM (Version 5), a software package created by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Census Bureau, shows population statistics from the 2000 Census for the WCS and ARS radii determined by the Offsite Consequence Analysis.  The radii are indicated at the top of each page.\n\n\n\n\n\nIII.  Worst Case/Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nThe following matrix shows the different scenarios evaluated in the process of determining what alternative release scenario would be reported to EPA.  It indicates the different parameters (hole area, pressure, temperature, time of release) used in calculating the distance to the endpoint for that particular scenario.  The scenarios reported to EPA for toxics and/or flammables are shown in red on the matrix.\n\nAlso included are printouts from RMP*Comp Version 1.07 showing results of the worst case and alternative release scenarios.  RMP*Comp is the software created by EPA to replicate the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document Look-up Tables and was used to calculate the distance to the endpoint for each scenario.  RMP*Comp analyses are printed for each of the scenarios reported in the matrix.  It should be noted that RMP*Comp requires pressure to be entered as ?psia? (absolute).  Therefore, all pressures found in these printouts will be 14"
