      "SummaryText": "About our Facility:\n    The East Plant Facility is located in rural western Union County, about 13 miles west of El Dorado and 17 miles south southeast of Magnolia, Arkansas.  Land use in the immediate vicinity of the site is primarily agricultural, with silviculture and animal operations predominating.  There is a bromine manufacturing facility operated by Great Lakes Chemical Corporation southwest of the East Plant Facility.  The plant is located on the west side of a low north - south trending hill or ridge just east of an intermittent stream.  The East Plant is a new facility which began operation in 2000.  \n    The location of the plant is due to the presence of natural brine deposits located about 1.5 miles beneath the plant.  These brines are withdrawn through a system of wells and processed to produce bromine and hydrogen sulfide, and then replaced into the same geologic formation by a second system of wells.  \n    The East Plant Facility produces bromine and sodium hydrosulfide.   \n\nAbout our accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n    The East Plant Facility has very active accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.  It is the policy of the East Plant Facility to reduce the risk of chemical release to the extent feasible.  The main vehicle for chemical risk reduction is the Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  When the OSHA PSM standard was promulgated, existing programs were subsumed into the PSM program following the OSHA standard.  The East Plant is subject to the same internal and external requirements as its sister plants in South Arkansas.  \n    The Policy of the East Plant is to first prevent the occurrence of emergency situations, but if prevention measures are unsuccessful, to respond to those situations in a professional and appropriate manner.  The site has an integrated Emergency Plan which follows EPA's \"One Plan\" concept.  East Plant personnel respond to emergencies on site with a trained fire b"

The emergency plan provides for coordination with local care givers, first responders, law enforcement, and the county emergency response infrastructure through the county-wide emergency plan.  \n    Briefly, if a chemical incident appears to have the potential for off site impact, the local County Emergency Coordinator would assume situational control, while East Plant personnel work to mitigate the problem.  If a situation has impact beyond the borders of Union County, the county-wide emergency plan provides for coordination with adjoining counties and parishes.\n    All of our south Arkansas facilities use the same basic accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.  Using the same plan makes training easier and coordination with local off site responders better.  Details of the emergency plans (such as maps; locations of response equipment) are different due to the physical differences in the facilities.\nRegulated substances handled at the East Plant:\n    The East Plant manages three regulated chemicals in one regulated process.  Information on the handling and storage of chemicals at the East Plant was gathered.  These three chemicals and one process were found to be subject to the RMP rule.  The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs are exactly the same for covered and non-covered processes; covered and non-covered chemicals are both subject to both programs.\n    The Risk Management Program has been incorporated into the PSM program to provide continuity.  A description of our risk management program is found below.  \n\nOur accidental release prevention program:\n    The East Plant Facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard - therefore subject to RMP Prevention Program 3.

This information is used in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).\n    PHA's have been conducted on all processes, and are repeated according to a regular schedule (maximum of 5 years) or when certain events trigger performance of the PHA.  The PHA identifies any and all possible mishaps, the likelihood and consequences of mishaps, and predicts how safety and mitigation systems will perform in the event of a mishap.  For each PHA, a team is formed which possesses the requisite expertise in engineering, process operations, hazard analysis, industrial hygiene, safety systems, and emergency response.  Several standard methods may be used to analyze the available information, and more than one method may be applied to a process hazard analysis.  The PHA documentation is retained for the life of the process.  This information is used to eliminate hazards when possible, and mitigate those hazards when elimination is not possible or impractical.\n    Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist when each process is first started up, and undergo continual review and improvement.  Some of the items included in SOP's are procedures for start-ups, shut-downs, routine or hazardous procedures, operation of safety and environmental control systems, and mitigation of process hazards.  SOPs are updated to reflect current operating conditions.  Each SOP is reviewed no less often than annually.\n    Training is the key aspect of accident prevention.  Each employee in an operating process receives job specific and general training on safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  This training is administered according to the needs of the employee and the specific requirements of the program.  \n    Preventative Maintenance (PM) is an integral part of our accidental release prevention program.

The program includes regular inspections and tests of process equipment consistent with manufacturer's recommendations, good engineering practices, and field experience.  Documentation of the results of tests and maintenance is maintained.  \n    When a new or modified system is started up for the first time, the likelihood of unexpected consequences is increased.  For this reason, pre-start-up reviews are conducted with the aim of insuring that: design specifications are adequate and have been met; adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place; and that employee training is adequate and has been completed.\n    Many historical accidents may be traced to a seemingly minor or inconsequential process change.  We manage process changes through a system that insures the impact of a change is assessed and appropriately addressed before the change is implemented.  Part of this program (Management of Change) is communication of the change and anticipated effects to all affected employees, and training provided as necessary.\n    To assure compliance with this program, regular audits are conducted. \n    We make every effort to minimize risk through training, preparation, and planning.  Yet an incident may occur.  When an incident occurs, an investigation is performed to determine the root causes for the incident and to recommend corrective action to prevent a reoccurrence.  These investigations are performed on minor (even trivial) incidents.

      "SummaryText": "the risk management program is ensured and encouraged.\n    We use a permit system to ensure that all aspects of a job (non-routine) must be considered before performing that job.  Each process issues Safe Work Permits for non routine jobs done in that area each day.  Permits generally expire at the end of a shift and are critical to communicating jobs in progress within a process area.  A Safe Work Permit may require the permittee to initiate and complete a Hot Work Permit before performing certain tasks.  Sometimes, tasks involving welding, cutting, braising, or other flame or spark producing activities, must be performed in areas where flammable chemicals are present.  Hot work permits ensure fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the work.  Another essential part of the risk management program is the use of \"lock out/ tag out\" procedures.  When a safe work permit is issued, the permit requires the permittee to assure that all sources of potential energy have been deactivated.  For instance, the permittee may perform the following procedures before working on a pump: Check the Safe Work Permit to make sure operations has purged and drained the pump; check the red tags in place to make sure the pump is isolated from the process; register the red tag on the unit Red Tag Master; and place a personal locking device on the electrical switchgear energizing the pump.  No employee can remove a red tag, actuate a tagged component, or remove a personal locking device placed by another employee.  \n    We depend on contractors and contract employees for many essential services.  Under our PSM program, we ensure that contractor preformed maintenance, repair, and general operations are preformed safely.

The EPA RMP program requires reporting on \"regulated\" chemicals in \"covered\" processes in the five years proceeding the date of RMP submission.  The East Plant (New in 2000) did not have any incidents which meet the EPA criteria. \n\nFacility emergency response program:\nOur emergency response plan is in the format developed by EPA, a format commonly known as the \"One Plan.\"  This particular format was developed to address the off site responder need for simplicity while complying with all regulatory requirements.  \n   The emergency response program is based on the principle that the facility should respond to incidents within the scope of the facility's expertise, while the local authorities respond within the scope of the Union County Emergency Response Plan.  This means that the facility is responsible for preventing incidents before they happen.  But if a incident does occur, the facility is responsible for mitigating the offsite consequences of the incident by source control.  The Union County Department of Emergency Management is charged with implementing the Union County Emergency Plan and coordinating the response.  The Union County Emergency Plan was developed by the Union County Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (UCLEPC) under the direction of the Union County Emergency Response Director with the aid of the Union County Judge.\n   The East Plant Emergency Plan contains procedures for response to chemical releases, fires, and natural disasters.
