P., has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant located in Eddy County, New Mexico,  owned by Enterprise Field Services L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, L.P..\n\nThe South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant is being constructed on the location of the existing South Carlsbad Compressor Station.  Historically, the gas produced in the area and flowing in the South Carlsbad gathering system has been compressed and flowed into long distance natural gas transmission pipelines.  The relatively lean gas has been subjected to glycol dehydration to remove water vapor , but has not been conditioned to remove potentially condensible hydrocarbons.  This has resulted in a gas hydrocarbon dew point which can be above the hydrocarbon dewpoint required by the receiving long distance, high pressure natural gas pipeline system.  As a result, Enterprise Field Services is installating a hydrocarbon dew point control plant on the South Carlsbad delivery to insure that the gas will meet contractural hydrocarbon dew point requirements in the future.  \n\nThe new South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant is a simple heat exchange and refrigeration process that will reduce the hydrocarbon dew point of "

The dew point control plant will utilize heat exchange and propane refrigeration to cool the gas to the required dew point, condensing the liquifiable hydrocarbons into a liquid phase.  The mixed hydrocarbon liquid stream will be flashed to a lower pressure and heated to stabilize the product for atmospheric storage and trucking.  The lighter, higher vapor pressure hydrocarbons that are removed from the recovered and stabilized liquid will be recompressed and recycled to the inlet of the dew point control plant.  \n\nThe South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities to be kept on site based on the process design and the size of the proposed process vessels.  Listed flammable substances which will be present above the threshold quantities at the South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and pentane.  The Plant is designed to operate as an unattended gas processing facility.  An operating technician will visit the site for a short period each day to check on the operation of the equipment and to confirm proper levels of operating and lubricating fluids.  Occasionally, a crew of technicians, possibly assisted by a maintenance contractor, will be present on site for extended periods to perform equipment maintenance tasks, frequently during periods when the entire plant is shut down. There are no other gas processing, gas compression or industrial facilities nearby, so the South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant qualifies for exemption from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation as a remote, unattended facility.  Due to the presence of regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity, the South Carlsbad Dew "

There are flammable substances on site, but no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  The calculated distance for the Worst Case Scenario is less than the distance to nearest offsite receptor.  Since there have been no accidents with offsite consequences within the last five years and emergency response is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Commission, the plant qualifies as an RMP Program 1 facility.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the safety and accident prevention program in place at the South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, but are not subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  Even though the South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant is exempt from OSHA PSM regulation coverage, the aforementioned commitment to safe operations at all Enterprise Products Operating, L.P. facilties has resulted in the implementation of a number of safety management best practices at the South Carlsbad facility.  Standard Enterprise safety management practices and programs utilized at the plant are detailed below.\n \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant?s safety program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding safety compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a ?near-miss? reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nNecessary process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS) which are available online through the Enterprise ImageWave MSDS viewer..\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and insure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings for existing facilities is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios are assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  For a new facility, the PHA team recommendations are forwarded to the Engineering Contractor for installation. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe South Carlsbad Dew Point Control Plant will have and maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.
