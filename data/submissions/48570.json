In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nMerchants Cold Storage Ammonia system can hold approximately 13,700 pounds. Should an accidental release occur, under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel up to 3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:  worst-case weather conditions are uncommon; the ve"

I also understand that Merchants Cold Storage operates an enclosed Ammonia System located at 240 Shorland Drive, Walton, KY 41094.\n\n\n\nDate:                  _______________________________________\n\nSignature:           _______________________________________\n\nPrinted Name:     _______________________________________"
