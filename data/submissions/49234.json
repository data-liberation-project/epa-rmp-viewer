(Enbridge) is committed to the same level of safety and environmental excellence that all other Enbridge assets promote.  This philosophy involves making every each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety as well as that of the community around them.  As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure that a safe and healthy environment for all.\n\nEmployees who enter the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant facility complete a thorough training program, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise.  This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training.  In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep \noperators? problem solving abilities up to date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements.  Our regular training audits provide an excellent checks and balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\n\nThe Weatherford Gas Processing Plant is one of many facilities operated by Enbridge.  At the facility, we receive wellhead gas from wells via pipeline.  We separate the liquid hydrocarbons out by employing the cryogenic extraction process.  There are no toxic substances present at the plant in quantities exceeding risk management planning thresholds.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  The purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is to provide information about our operations at the facility, our programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, and our emergency response plans in case an accidental release should occur.  \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs specified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP regulations, our worst-case release scenario for flammables would be the l"

In the case of the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant, this would involve our 26,500-gallon Plant B Product Surge Tank (V-4403).  Using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) would be approximately 0.4 mile (2,112).  An overpressure of 1 psi is the EPA?s threshold for measurable impacts.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown, etc.) and to manage potential consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario. \n\nBecause there are off-site receptors (residences and commercial buildings) within the 1 psi overpressure of the worst case scenario, an Alternative Release Scenario for flammable substances was considered at this plant.  An Alternate Release Scenario would result from the loss of NGL from a 17,000-gallon Plant A Demethanizer Bottoms Surge Tank (D8.0304).  The Alternate Release Scenario would result in an instantaneous release of 17,000 gallons of NGL.  Using the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) methods, the distance at which the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) would be approximately 0.3 mile (1,584 feet).  Off-site receptors are located within the Alternative Release Scenario radius. \n\nWe have discussed potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Parker County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public.   \n\n\nPrevention Program \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Weatherford Gas Processing Plant.

Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).  \n\nProcess Safety Information:  Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-If/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nTraining:  In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods for increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with orientation sessions pertaining to these key points.  \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR):  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  \n\nMechanical Integrity:  Enbridge has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment, that will be implemented at Weatherford Gas Processing Plant.

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC):  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation:  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant will promptly investigate all incidents that result in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

We place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to reduce the risk of accidents.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWeatherford Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  Employees receive training in these procedures as needed to perform their specific emergency response duty.  \n\nThe emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or other Enbridge facilities.  The emergency response program changes are administered through facilities and the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.  \n\nThe overall emergency response program for Weatherford Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Parker County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Weatherford Gas Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (fire department).  "

      "SummaryText": "This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Weatherford Gas Processing Plant will conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the gas plant will provide annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.  \n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n -     Diligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at Weatherford Gas Processing Plant.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n -     The MOC provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n -     The PHA provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\n -     The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n -     Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n -     An ongoing dialogue with the Parker County LEPC Chairman will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops.  In this way, we shall bolster our strong commitment to the safety of our workers and the community.\n\nWe encourage all interested citizens or community organizations to contact the Parker County LEPC Chairman for the latest information on emergency response for the county.  We plan to diligently integrate our response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
