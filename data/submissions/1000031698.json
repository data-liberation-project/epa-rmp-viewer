      "SummaryText": "Frosty Packing Co., LLC operates an apple packing warehouse and refrigeration storage in the northwest part of Yakima, Washington.  This RMP is for a storage only facility on 2809 River Road.  Apples are harvested and loaded in regular cold storage rooms and controlled atmosphere rooms over a several week period in the fall. Apples are removed from the storages and are washed, sorted, and packaged for fresh fruit markets, year round. The packaged apples are stored in refrigerated rooms until shipment. A refrigeration operator checks the operation of the system every work day and a continuous monitoring and alarming is done by the facility computer control system. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the system. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. It is present as both a liquid under pressure and as a vapor in the system. There is 10,981 pounds ammonia in the refrigeration system. To maintain a safe facility operation the Frosty Packing Co., LLC has developed an emergency action plan that provides instructions to all employees of what actions to take if an ammonia release is detected. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). A majority of all refrigerated areas in the facility are monitored by an ammonia detection system and any alarm would also be sent to the refrigeration operator by a dial up modem. Also, the computer system will notify the refrigeration operator on any alarming or out of normal condition in the system (temperatures/pressures). All employees at the facility receive annual training on the emergency action plan with annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan. The facility has complied with both State and Federal regulations regarding ammonia used as a refrigerant, and has in place both the OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) (29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) (40 CFR, Part 68). These programs are r"

      "SummaryText": "eadily available to on-site personal to help in maintaining a safe operating facility. As required by the RMP an \"Off-site Consequence Analysis\" has been done for the facility to determine what impact the \"Worse Case\", and the more realistic \"Alternate Case\" releases of ammonia would have to the surrounding area. There have been no reportable releases of ammonia from the system during the last five years. To deal with any possible release of ammonia Frosty Packing Co., LLC maintains an ongoing relationship with two experienced refrigeration contractors, both within 6 miles away in Yakima. In the event of a significant accident, the fire department is about five minutes away. The facility has an action plan, not a response plan, so it is not expected or intended that employees would attempt to enter the facility until proper trained personnel with the appropriate PPE arrive. Frosty Packing Co., LLC has taken many steps to improve the safety at the facility. All of the refrigeration computer controls have be updated with new computers and software. Ventilation has been increased in the machine rooms and ammonia detection has been added to several unprotected locations. "
