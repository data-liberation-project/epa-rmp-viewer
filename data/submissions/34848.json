              "Description": "Our stationary source includes a double walled railcar (built to D.O.T. specifications) with transfer piping and three process injection points.  The railcar supplied by the chemical vendor is equipped with an excess flow valve. Three remotely-operated solenoid valves are located in the main pipeline header.  In the event of a transfer piping leak the railcar can be remotely isolated.  The main transfer piping is composed of 3/4\" welded stainless steel.  To minimize the possibility of fitting and joint leaks, the main transfer header is constructed with socket weld joints.  Two of the three process injection points are inside the factory building.  Process piping for these two injection points is composed of 1/2\" stainless steel tubing. In the event of an SO2 leak within the factory building, these 1/2\" headers can be remotely isolated with the solenoid valves.  In addition to the structural safeguards noted above, several notable points of our prevention program are listed below: 1.) A Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) has been implememted as outlined in 29 CFR 1910. 2.) An emergency railcar capping kit is onsite to securely isolate any leaking railcar valves or fittings. 3.) Depending on ambient temperatures, liquid spills forming puddles may be neutralized using calcium carbonate which is present onsite. 4.) Risk management program has been discussed with local officials and emergency service departments. 5.) SO2 rail cars are only stored onsite during beet processing campaigns which last approximately five months per year (Oct. - Feb.).  After each beet processing campaign the railcars are returned to the chemical vendor.",

This plan protects both onsite workers and the public.\n    B. Local officials and emergency service deparments have reviewed the factory Risk Management Plan and Emergency Preparedness and Contingency Plan (EPCP).\n    C. Accidental releases will be reported per the Emergency Planning Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA 302 & 355).\n    D. Minor leaks (e.g., leaking fitting) will be addressed by factory personnel using our Standard Operating Procedures for SO2.\n    E. Nyssa Rural Fire Department will be notified in the event of a reportable release.\n2. Stationary source & hazardous material handled.\n    A. Stationary source is a railcar.\n    B. Material is anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2), liquidified under pressure.\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n    A. PSM has been implemented as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.\n    B. Emergency railcar capping kit is onsite to isolate any leaking railcar fittings or valves.\n    C. Remote control solenoid valves have been installed at several locations on SO2 transfer lines. In event of a leak, these valves can be triggered to isolate both the railcar and sections of the transfer piping.\n    D. To minimize the possibility of leaks, the main transfer line is constructed of 3/4'' SS pipe with socket weld joints.\n    E. Depending on ambient temperatures, liquid spills forming puddles may be neutralized using calcuim carbonate available onsite.\n    F.
