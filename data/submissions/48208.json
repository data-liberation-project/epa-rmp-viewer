      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIntroduction\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment. They are transported on roads, water, and railways. The Idaho Falls Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) uses chemicals, too, such as chlorine to disinfect wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment and for landscaping or irrigation uses. The WPCP chlorination system uses chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine containers. Because storing large quantities of chlorine can be hazardous, the WPCP takes its safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as providing safe, disinfected water to the environment. The following document describes what could happen in the event of an accident, the steps the WPCP takes everyday to ensure safe operation, and what to do in event of an emergency. Please feel free to contact David Smith at 208-529-1108 if you have any questions.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe Idaho Falls WCPC and Idaho Falls Fire Department accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff on operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of Idaho and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures. \nThis document complies with the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP), under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), Amendments of 1990 and 2004 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. This document summarizes the WPCP?s existing health and safety programs, internal management response team, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine to the environment. The WPCP has prepared a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle any potentia"

To date, the WPCP has an excellent record in accident prevention.\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\nThe Idaho Falls WPCP, operating since 1973, is located at 4055 Glen Koester Road, City of Idaho Falls, Bonneville County, Idaho. The WPCP is on a 29-acre property about 3 miles south of the center of town and adjacent to Snake River. Wastewater from the Bonneville service area is treated at the WPCP, and the disinfected water is either discharged into the Snake River or reclaimed for landscaping and irrigation uses. The Idaho Falls Wastewater Treatment Plant is designed for 17 MGD, 35,000 lbs. BOD, and 38,000 lbs.TSS.  It currently receives 10.5 MGD, 20,000 lbs. BOD, and 18,000 lbs. TSS.  \n\nUpon entering the plant, the wastewater passes through a pair of one-eighth inch diameter escalator punch plate screens. The raw sewage is screened using fine screening technology with an opening of approximately 3 millimeters.  The solids removed by fine screens are washed to remove organic material, dewatered and compacted to remove the free water, and loaded into a storage dumpster.  All of the equipment and facilities are located indoors in the new Headworks Building to facilitate equipment operation and maintenance.  The screened material is landfilled.\nThe wastewater then flows to an aerated grit chamber and then to the primary clarifier.  Floatables from the top of the clarifier as well as the settled sludge from the bottom are pumped into the primary digesters.  These digesters are of the anaerobic type and utilize the mesophilic temperature range for digestion and stabilization of sludge.\n\nAfter leaving the primary clarifier, the sewage flows to the secondary pump station where it is pumped over an activated biological filter tower.  This tower utilizes redwood media and the wastewater is passed over it at a super rate in excess of 27 million gallons a day. The purpose"

      "SummaryText": " of this tower is to remove nutrients and act as a buffer to prevent ?shock loads? from affecting the activated sludge system.\n\nUpon discharging from the tower, the wastewater enters the aeration basins.  The basins are of a complete mix type and utilize floating aerators with propellers to provide aeration and mixing.  These basins together with the ?tower? provide an environment for higher bacterial life forms to develop.  These bacteria multiply utilizing additional wastewater as a food source.  Normal detention time for the basins is about 5 hours under present flow conditions.\n\nFollowing aeration the flow passes to the secondary clarifiers providing a resting stage where the microbial solids ?clump? together and settle.  The settled solids return (underflow) to the secondary pump station and remix with primary effluent thus creating activated sludge.  A portion of this recirculated settled sludge is wasted daily to the solids handling building where centrifuges thicken the sludge and pump it into the primary digesters.  It is wasted to keep the microbial population in balance.\n \nAfter clarification, the wastewater (overflow) enters the chlorine contact chambers where it is disinfected with chlorine gas. Following disinfection the residual chlorine is neutralized with sodium bisulfite and discharged to the Snake River.\n\nFollowing anaerobic digestion the sludge is further stabilized in a storage lagoon and easily meets all the ?Class B? requirements set forth in the 40 CFR 503 regulations.  It is used as a fertilizer and soil conditioner on farmland in the area\nThe WPCP currently stores chlorine; a regulated toxic substances under the RMP regulations. Chlorine is stored in twelve, 1-ton steel containers containing a maximum of 12 tons of chlorine. This chlorine storage exceeds the listed threshold quantities in both the RMP Rules and in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Rules (29 CFR 1910.119).

Current processes only allow gaseous chlorine to be withdrawn from the 1-ton containers. In both the Tank Room and the Chlorinator Room, chlorine leak detectors monitor continuously for chlorine leaks. In the event of a leak, the detectors sound an alarm at the plant control panel; additionally, the tank area has both an audible alarm and a flashing warning light inside and outside of the building. \nBoth the Tank and the Chlorinator Rooms are enclosed in the Chlorine Building. The Tank Room is equipped with an automatic chlorine scrubber ventilation system that automatically operates when 5 parts per million (ppm) of chlorine are detected in the room. An emergency shower and eye wash station are provided on the outside of the building. Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) packs are available onsite in the Administration Building. The Chlorine Building has a fire sprinkler and fire alarm system in the event of a fire.\nThe WPCP entrance is controlled by a gate at Glen Koester Road. Visitors and contractors must enter the administration building and be approved by WPCP staff prior to entry into the WPCP. The WPCP is staffed year-round, 24 hours a day. \nElectrical power is available to the chlorination and dechlorination facilities in the event of an emergency. The back-up generator starts within seconds of electrical power supply loss and supplies power to critical processes within the WPCP, including the chlorine leak detectors, lighting, and ventilation systems.\n Summary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chlorine-Specific Prevention Steps \nThe WPCP has a thorough Safety Management Program.

A list of actions to resolve any found significant hazard review findings was prepared, and staff has resolved this action item list. \nOperating Procedures\nThe Idaho Falls WPCP maintains up-to-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the chlorine process. The WPCP ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the chlorine system. Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation. Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, consequences of deviation, and steps to correct deviations. Procedures are updated whenever a change occurs that alters the steps for safe operation. Operating procedures will be developed and in place before starting-up a changed process or before any new process equipment goes on-line.\nOperations and Maintenance Training Program\nEach WPCP employee presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine process is trained in a process overview and in detailed, applicable, operation and maintenance procedures. The WPCP helps its employees understand, through training, the nature and cause of problems arising from operations involving chlorine on site, and increases its employees' awareness with respect to these hazards.
