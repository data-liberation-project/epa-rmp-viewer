Chemicals Incorporated\r\nFully complies with these regulations with employee training and written plans. Additionally, the facility is a\r\nmember of Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu, the local emergency response group.\r\n\r\n2. Source and Substances Handled\r\nPrimary Activities: Specialty Chemical Toll Manufacturer\r\nUse of Substances:\r\nHydrochloric Acid (toxic): 55,000 lbs (max) bulk storage tank (8,000 gallons) - 2 Nos.\r\nTrimethylamine 19.5% solution (flammable): Total of 52,800 lbs 19.5% solution (appox. 10296 lbs of TMA) stored in in 14 totes and 72 drums. Max in a tote is 2062 lbs solution, which is approx. 40.2 lbs TMA.\r\nFormaldehyde solution -37% (Formalin) (toxic): One bulk storage tank of 6,338 gal. \r\nEthyl chloride: There are 22 cylinders (each net 800 lbs). Therefore total in Warehouse=17,600 lbs. But the Max used in the process is 3,300 lbs (charged to TK 808 from about 4.5 cylinders).\r\n\r\n3. Consequence Analysis\r\n a. Toxic Worst Case Scenario:\r\n(I) Hydrochloric acid: Failure of a 4,000 gallon tank (80% full) of Hydrochloric Acid (37%) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of contents over a 174 minute period inside a diked (secondary containment) area of 11721 sq.ft and dike height of 1.5 ft. The 31,750 pounds (approx.) would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 2.7 miles.\r\n(II) Formaldehyde solution: Failure of a 6,355 gallon tank of Formaldehyde solution (37%) with no emergency response resulting in the complete release of 42,000 pounds of contents. The 42,000 pounds released would form a vapor cloud with a toxic endpoint radius of 0.8 miles.\r\n\r\n b. Toxic Alternative Scenario:\r\n(I) hydrochloric acid: Hole/rupture (1 inch dia = 0.785 sq.inch) in 4000 gallon tank of Hydrochlo"
