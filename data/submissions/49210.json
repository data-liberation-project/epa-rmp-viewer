      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary    \n\nNew York City DEP uses chlorine to meet the New York State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water Act disinfection requirements.  Hillview Reservoir is one of the locations where some of the City?s water is treated with chlorine.\n\nNew York City DEP is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through the City emergency management agencies.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nDEP is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment and individual designated as the RMP Responsible Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.   The RMP Responsible Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both the EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management Requirements.\n\nTo ensure that an offsite release does not occur, the NYC DEP maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\n?    Chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n\n?    Process Safety Information to document the safe process design;\n\n?    Process Hazard Analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n\n?    Operating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\n\n?    Maintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained accor"

Training, hot work permits, contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\n\n?    Management of Change and Pre-startup Safety Reviews to ensure that the changes are documented, analyzed and kept within the design basis;\n\n?    Incident Investigation procedure to investigate each incident and ?near misses? to determine root causes and make needed safety improvements; and,\n\n?    Periodic compliance audits to ensure that our programs are working as they should to protect both employees and the public.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years, the Hillview Reservoir Facility has not had an accidental release that resulted in injuries or property damage.  The plant has never had a major chlorine release that had an adverse effect on the public.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Hillview Reservoir Facility coordinates emergency response with the Fire Department.  If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the DEP police who would contact the Yonkers Fire Department who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release.\n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\n\nThe NYC DEP continually works to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect employees and the community we serve.  The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices.  Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization.  Although the chance of any chlorine release at the Hillview Reservoir Facility is remote, DEP is planning to insta"
