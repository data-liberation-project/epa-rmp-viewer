The carbon dioxide is purified, compressed and refrigerated into liquid form and the carbon dioxide is stored under pressure as a refrigerated liquid.  This facility also manufactures and processes various forms of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice).  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in two independant and separate Ammonia refrigeration  systems located in the facility.  Each system has an ammonia receiver that stores the ammonia refrigerant in addition to various heat exchangers, compressors, condensors and connecting piping and valves.\n\n       Our worst case scenario for the ammonia system is a failure of the ammonia receiver resulting in the release of ammonia.  The quantity of the release is estimated to be 13,000 lb of ammonia over a 10 minute period of time with the most stable of atmospheric conditions which minimizes dispersion of a release and thus the worst case of quantity released and worst case due to atmospheric conditions.  The calculated toxic endpoint of which the concentration is calculated not to exceed 200 ppm is 1.4 miles.  These calculations are based on the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  Public receptors identified within 1.4 miles of the facility include residences, schools, prison/correctional facilities, recreational facilities, and commercial/industrial areas.\n\n       An alternate release scenario was also calculated using EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  A leak from a pipe, pump or vessel was assumed to create a release of 133 lb. per minute.  The atmospheric conditions are assumed more typical of the area and the calculated toxic endpoint of which the ammonia concentration is said not to exceed 200ppm. is 530 feet (0.1 miles).  Again calculations were based on EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  Public re"

In addition, this facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management regulations.  Our comprehensive prevention program includes documented process safety information to ensure safe and reliable plant operation, process hazard analysis to identify and train all effected employees in the hazards associated with the operation of an ammonia refrigeration system, mechanical integrity procedures to ensure adequate and proper plant maintenance.  Should an accident or near miss occur, procedures are in place to thoroughly investigate the incident and take corrective action as necessary.  We believe the key to preventing incidents is continously improving our operating and prevention procedures and better educating our employees.\n\n       Since the start-up of the plant in 1996, we have not experienced any accidents involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, property damage; or that resulted in any offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n       In the event of an ammonia release, the plant has developed an emergency response plan and procedure.  If necessary, the Pekin Fire Department will be contacted and emergency reponse procedures will be coordinated with the Pekin Fire Department.  The Fire Department has inspected our facility and we will continue to work  with the fire department, the Tazewell County LEPC and any other local authorities in order to most effectively protect our employees, our property, and the community.\n\n       This facility is committed to the continued safety of its employees and the community by adhering with all applicable federal, state and local laws.
