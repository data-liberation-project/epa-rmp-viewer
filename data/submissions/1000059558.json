ARB plans to start operations in September 2016 to operate a bulk chemical and material transfer facility to offload materials from rail cars to appropriate tanker trucks.  This RMP Executive Summary has been prepared for the offloading of butane. This facility is subject to the Program 3 requirements of 40 CFR 68 due to the quantities of butane in rail tanker storage on site during transfer operations.\r\n\r\nThe process at ARB includes bulk transfer of butane from a stationary rail cars to a waiting empty LPG transport truck.  Only one rail car will be offloaded at a time.  The maximum inventory can never exceed the quantity of butane that was originally in the rail car.  The rail car capacity is 30,000 gallons.   ARB expects that as many as 10 rail cars may be spotted on the private siding at one time, and therefore the maximum inventory available on site is 300,000 gallons of butane.\r\n\r\nAll materials used in construction of the new process (including soft-goods) are compatible with LPG as required by NFPA-58.  Materials of construction for the Butane Railcar Offloading Process are generally carbon steel, with stainless steel and brass used on a select number of items.  Material call-outs are listed on the P&ID for piping and valve components.  Additional details regarding specific items of equipment, valves, and other components are included in the transloader Job Book which is kept on site in the office.\r\n\r\nARB has developed written programs, conducted the initial PHA, trained personnel, and conducted the PSSR as required for a Program 3 process subject to 40 CFR 68.  ARB has also conducted process and program inspections to insure that the preventive measures needed to safely manage the transfer operations for butane are practiced.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThis is a new process with startup planned in early September 2"

Since this is a new process there have been no accidents resulting in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  ARB believes that the facility's chemical accident preparedness and prevention programs with regard to butane provide the framework for continued and sustained safe performance for actions related to this process.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at ARB:\r\nThe top priority of safe operations by ARB is worker and community safety and environmental stewardship.  To that end, ARB will work closely with local and state agencies to implement programs as required by federal, state, and local regulations.\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps \r\nARB is committed to operating the butane transfer operation in a safe manner.  ARB personnel have been given training on safety information including information pertaining to the hazards of the regulated substance (butane), the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process.  In addition, ARB has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safe use and operation of the transfer equipment, ARB will conduct periodic maintenance of process components, and will safely manage change to the covered process or equipment through the use of management of change procedures.\r\n\r\nARB has implemented butane transloader safety systems to include the following as required by NFPA-58: emergency shut-down valves at the rail car with manual, ESD, thermal, and excess flow activation; emergency shut-down valves at the transport truck connections with manual, ESD, thermal, and break-away activation; sight glass/check valves; ESD air dump valves (5 total) on each corner at ground level as well as on rail car working platform; B.A.S.E. engineering shutdown system for remotely activa"
