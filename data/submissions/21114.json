      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\n\nIt is the policy of the General Mills Operations, Inc. (GMOI), Carlisle, Iowa, facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to GMOI employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nGMOI management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe GMOI, Carlisle, Iowa, facility utilizes flourmills to produce flour. The raw materials used in the processes are wheat flour and chlorine gas. Support operations include a grain elevator, warehouse, a quality assurance/control laboratory, and administrative offices. Figure 1-1 shows the site location. Figure 1-2 shows the site plan.\n\nOne chemical is utilized at the facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP. The chemical is chlorine and is used to bleach or age the flour.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nChlorine\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a chlorine release included a release of all the contents of one of the 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders in a 10-minute period (per EPA guidelines). This release translates to a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes or 200 pounds/min. Other assumptions included in the worst-case assessment are: the chlorine is a liquefied gas; the cylinder is not diked; the release does not take place indoors; the nearfield dispersion environ"

      "SummaryText": "ment is characterized as rural; 10-minute averaging period; the wind speed is 1.5 meters/sec, and the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable). The results of the worst-case assessment for chlorine show that the plume must travel 3.0 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 3.0 parts per million (ppm). Figure 1-3 shows the worst-case release radius.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from a flour plug on the inlet side of the flour agitator. The plug prevents flour from entering the agitator, which results in the loss of the flour seal on the discharge side of the agitator. The chlorine is released in the mill building as a vapor. The release rate is a maximum of 121 lb/hour (2.0 lb/min).\n\nThe distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l is 0.1 miles. Figure 1-4 shows the alternate case release scenario radii.\n\nNo active or passive mitigation measures are currently in place. The meteorological data used for this alternative release scenario was a wind speed of 3 meter/sec, an atmospheric stability classification of D (neutral stability), and an urban dispersion environment in the nearfield.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Carlisle facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public, and to the environment. These regulations include:\n\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n\nThe key concepts in GMOI release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.\n\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by GMOI manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment. Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the chlorine system.\n\nGMOI policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes. This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.\n\nGMOI is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures. New employees are provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility. In addition, GMOI conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year. Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nGMOI has not had a release of chlorine from the Carlisle facility that has affected their employees, the public or the environment.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nGMOI does not have personnel trained in emergency response at the facility. The Carlisle Fire and Rescue Department will be the first response organization contacted. In the event of a chlorine release that threatens the public, environment, or GMOI employees, the Carlisle Fire and Rescue Department has the authority to contact the Des Moines HazMat Team for assistance.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nGMOI and Research Products Company complete a thorough review of the chlorine systems each time a design change is implemented. The system is also evaluated each time the PHA is revised. GMOI is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
