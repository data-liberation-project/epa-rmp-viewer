      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThis facility handles anhydrous ammonia, which is considered a hazardous material.  The properties of  the material make it necessary to observe safety precautions in handling to prevent human exposure and to reduce the threat to the facility's workers and nearby members of the community.  It is the facility's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State of California rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the safe procedures used to handle anhydrous ammonia; the safety devices and systems designed and constructed into the facility; and the training of pertinent personnel.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at Sierra Hills Packing in a refrigeration system to provide cooling to fruit product stored in the cooling rooms of the facility.  The cooling inhibits the ripening process of the fruit and prolongs its shelf life.  The refrigeration system is state-of-the-art technology for the application.  It is computer controlled and has micro processors as part of the control system.  The majority of the refrigeration equipment is located in or near the Mechanical Equipment Room.  The remainder of the refrigeration equipment items are located in the fruit storage rooms and the shipping area.  The ammonia is delivered to the Facility in liquid form and is pumped into a 3,900 gallon capacity High Pressure Receiver.\n\nThe receipt, storage, and handling of the subject substance is considered part of a single process.\n\n3a.  Administrative Controls\n\nAdministrative controls to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of anhydrous ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably, to not have a release occur.  These administrative controls are inherent in the operational procedures for the anhydrous ammonia systems and the training provided to the anhydrous ammonia system operators"

      "SummaryText": ".\n\n3b.  Mitigation Measures\n\nMitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario exists to restrict to a minimum the amount of anhydrous ammonia released, if a release were to occur, and preferably, to not have a release occur.  The mitigation measures are based upon the design, inspection, testing, and maintenance of the anhydrous ammonia system and its related equipment and components.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility complies with all applicable federal and state codes and regulations.  There are safety meetings and safety training.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) program implemented at the facility for the anhydrous ammonia related system activities and equipment represents one of the facility's main active commitments to an accidental release prevention program.\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years at the facility.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is based on alerting personnel at the facility of the need to evacuate the facility and await the arrival of responders from the City of Stockton Fire Department at the evacuation assembly location if a release occurs that causes the evacuation to be initiated.  The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services may incorporate this response into the County Area Plan for the Region 4 Local Emergency Planning Commission.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCommitments made under the Process Safety Management (PSM) are implemented as scheduled by the facility.  Current applicable codes and regulations are reviewed as a part of the PSM to determine if other commitments need to be made to achieve increased operational safety for the regulated process system.  These commitments will be prevention and mitigation measures for accidental releases of the regulated substance."
