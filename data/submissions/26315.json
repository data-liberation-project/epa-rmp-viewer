All employees are trained to  high levels of preparedness to cope with such eventualities.    A policy of providing emergency response information is and has been a central part of Dumont's policies.   In advance of this program Dumont has provided local responders, such as fire departments, facility layouts, etc.    The company has also extended complimentary training to some county governmental agencies.\n\nThe Dumont Company is a distributor of industrial chemicals primarily serving water, wastewater treatment, agricultural and industrial customers.  The business has less than four on-site employees and would be considered small in comparison to other similarly titled business.    The only materials stored in sufficient quantities to warrant reporting under SARA Title III at the Starke stationary site is Chlorine, CAS# 7782-50-5.\n\nDumont performs the following functions at its Starke operations facility pertaining to Federal Regulations contained in 40 CFR 68.\n\n1.    Receives, unloads and stores vessels containing a material covered under 40 CFR 68 (specifically - chlorine) from vendors. \n2.    Reloads and transports subject transport vessels to customers premises. \n3.    Transports, unloads, and stores empty subject vessels.\n4.    Reloads empty subject vessels on vendor transportation.. \n5.    Normal storage quantities are twenty-five one hundred fifty pound containers.\n\nDumont does not in its normal course of business perform any of the following functions with the material subject to the regulation sited. \n\n1.    Dumont does not consume subject material. \n2.    Dumont does not product the material or convert the material to another form. \n3.    Dumont does not package or repa"
