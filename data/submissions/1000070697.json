      "SummaryText": "This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements specified for risk management programs from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nGaseous chlorine is the regulated substance handled by the Llano Water Treatment Plant. The chlorine treatment system consists of four one-ton chlorine gas cylinders. Chlorinators dose the water at a rate of 390PPD. \n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of a chlorine release, the operators will immediately call 911 to notify the city fire department of the hazard. Operators will then contact the Utility Director to notify him of the accident. If operators are unequipped to fix the release themselves, or if the leak is so hazardous that it is beyond their ability to do so feasibly, the city emergency responders will attend to the release in accordance with the community's emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.\n\n\n\nThe main goal of the risk management plan is to identify ways to work safely and effectively, ultimately preventing accidental releases in the first place. To prevent accidental releases, employees are trained in safe work practices, and training regularly updated. Safe operating procedures were developed and continue to be expanded upon through the prevention program outlined in this report. By encouraging employees to be consistently aware in their surroundings, and confident in their skills, we can prevent accidental releases from taking place.\n\n\n\nLlano has not had an accidental release of chlorine within the last five years. The stationary source is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C 11003. Based on the results of the process safety management program, as outlined in this report, changes to improve safety are being implemented. Since discussing the possible hazards of the work site, such as dangers when working with the automatic crane, operators are more aware of how to conduct themselves safely.\n\n"
