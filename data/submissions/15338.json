      "SummaryText": "The City of Fredericksburg is located in Gillespie County, Texas and provides wastewater treatment facilities to the City of Fredericksburg citizens.  The treatment plant is located on U.S. Hwy 290 and serves approximately 7,500 people.  The primary disinfectant for the wastewater, once it is treated, is chlorine gas.  The entire supply on-site consists of 2, one-ton cylinders.\n\nOnly one cyclinder is in the process,while the other remains as the back-up or replacement cylinder.  A vacuum system prevents leaks from the tank and a chlorine leak detector is in operation.  The chlorine system is monitored several times daily and monitored on the weekends daily by an on-site operator.  Preventative maintenance is performed regularly and all manifold piping is replaced annually, regardless of condition.\n\nThe City of Fredericksburg Fire Department provides emergency services for the treatment plant and for the City of Fredericksburg.  Emergency Response efforts for chlorine releases will be coordinated with the Fire Department.  An SCBA is available at the wastewater treatment plant to handle chlorine emergencies.\n\nAn emergency action plan is being prepared, which will be maintained on-site at the wastewater treatment plant.  The plan includes:\n1.  Identification of an incident commander, operations and safety coordinator, and information coordinator\n2.  Compilation of incident checklists and emergency notification lists in a central location.\n3.  Compilation of all MSDS in a central location.\n4.  Mapping of the immediate area with identification of all residents and businesses which might be potentially affected."
