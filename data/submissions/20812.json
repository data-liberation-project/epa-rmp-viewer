We have a refrigerated storage capacity of 250,000 BBLS in three refrigerated storage tanks, an additional 120,000gallons are stored in four pressurized bullets. We are engaged in the wholesale business, our primary customers are LPG distributors. We also serve as back up fuel  supply to a 500 MW Power Generating Plant.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n-The Scenario. Rupture of 8\" pipe in the refrigerated tank base, 10 minutes release. A total of 500,000 pounds of propane released at ground level and subsequent Vapor Cloud Explosion.\n-Distance to endpoint. Using reference table #9, distance to 1 psi overpressure = 0.64 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\n-The Scenario. Vapor Cloud Explosion from 150,000 pounds presurized tank .\n-Distance to endpoint. Using reference table #9 , distance to 1 psi overpressure = 0.43 miles.\n\nPrevention Program:\nWe are covered by OSHA 29 CFR 1910 9 (PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT). Since the the nature of the business is to handle an mantain propane inventories, everything is covered by PSM except the waste water handling activities.\n\nThe most important element of our prevention program is the computerized preventive maintenance system.The relaibility and integrity of the plant is assured, leaving little marg"

OurTraining Program in the other hand closes the error marging, it allows our personnel to complement the maintenance program with their input in maintenance and operational issues.\n\nAccident History:\nIn the History of the Terminal we have never expirienced an accidental release of propane with offsite consequences. No accidental release of propane has ever resulted in off site or in plant death or injury. No environmental restoration activity has ever been conducted as a result of an accidental release of propane.\n\nEmergency Responce Program:\nThe Emergency Response Plan has been designed to mitigate effects of a potential release of propane. This is accomplished by anticipating potential situations that may affect the terminal. Personnell is trained in this procedures, refresher training and drills are performed with the participation of local responce groups.\n\nPlans to Improve Safety:\nWe have plans to continuoslly improve safety. Improvements are made by adding new technologies, adding emergency responce equipment, providing responce training and making critical systems redundant as additional back up to help respond to emergencies. We have a capital investment budget dedicated to the implementation of new technologies and  the resolution of safety and environmental concerns raised by the 2 years internal Safety Audits or by the 5 year HAZOP reviews. In ProCaribe there is no compromise with Safety."
