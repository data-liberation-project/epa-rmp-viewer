West Point, Nebraska facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.  This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.\nTyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n2.  Facility Description\nTyson operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  Tyson operates rendering systems for low protein beef byproducts, and tallow at this location.  Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, a potable water treatment system, cold storage, and administrative offices.\nTwo chemicals are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  These chemicals are chlorine and ammonia.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant and to treat potable water, wash water, and wastewater.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the facility.\n3.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe West Point, Nebraska facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, t"

Tyson has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia and chlorine systems.  Tyson employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\nTyson policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.  Tyson maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\nTyson is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility.  In addition, Tyson conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of Tyson?s emergency response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n4.  Five Year Accident "

      "SummaryText": "History\nBetween March 1999 and March 2004, Tyson has had no reportable accidents that qualified for the five year accident history and has not had a release of ammonia or chlorine from the West Point, Nebraska facility that has affected the public or the environment.\n5.  Emergency Response Program\nTyson has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nTyson completes a thorough review of the ammonia and chlorine system each time a design change is implemented.  Tyson is committed to using these methods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
