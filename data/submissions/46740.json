Our network of 74 modern distribution centres, our modern fleet of trucks, our dedicated service teams, and the know-how gained through 60 years in public refrigerated warehousing add up to integrated and flexible solutions to meet all of your temperature-sensitive food handling needs. From storing, processing and freezing raw ingredients, to inventory management and complete third-party logistics and local, regional, and national distribution - look to us. We're first in cold! \n\nVersacold's senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but to also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  The facility maintains a Safety Committee whose members are involved in reviewing the PSM  Program.  Versacold has an Emergency Response Plan (Plan) in effect, which is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document maintained at the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility is located on a 90 acre site, 0.25 miles east of Route 435 in the city of Gouldsboro, Pennsylvania. The cold areas are refrigerated using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Internati"

The mitigation measures generated from this study include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The Versacold safety committee is planning to complete several items, including the recommendations, over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\u00bf  Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\u00bf  Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\u00bf  Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\u00bf Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

The majority of each system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold areas.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Versacold ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\nIn addition to the 2000 IMC, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\nGiven the presence of anhydrous ammonia, Versacold has in place a Process Safety Management program to ensure the safety of employees and the general public in the vicinity.  This program addresses items related to the operation of ammonia based refrigeration systems including but not limited to the handling of the chemical, operator training, equipment selection and maintenance, contractor qualifications, preventative maintenance programs, routine and e"

Versacold also has an emergency action plan in effect, which is designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\nAmmonia has a strong pungent odor which is detectable at very low concentration levels when released to the atmosphere.  The refrigeration system is designed such that under normal operating conditions, no ammonia is released to the atmosphere.  However, unforseen circumstances or system upset could lead to leakage of a portion of the ammonia from the system.  Given the strong odor of ammonia, even a small quantity of released ammonia will be detected at some distance from the source of the leak.  Ammonia is detectable by its odor at levels well below that which will raise health concerns.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe construction of the facility will be completed in October 2006.  There is no accident history to report at the time of this writing.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Versacold facility has a Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations.  This Plan outlines the policies and procedures in place to respond to potential ammonia alarms or releases.  The facility has several trained personnel to assist in an orderly evacuation as well as to diagnose the alarm condition.  The facility employs a total of 240 people full-time.  However, the facility operates in shifts, with a maximum of 90 employees on site during any shift. \n\nThe Response Plan for On-Site Emergency Operations includes the facility emergency coordinators, the staff alerting list, emergency notification list, and the hazardous material agency notification and procedures.  This Plan then proceeds to detail the procedures for employees and management in the event of a fire, evacuation, compressor room shut down, blackout, and ammonia release/clean-up.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFET"
