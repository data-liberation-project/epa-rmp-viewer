(Braskem) Seadrift Operations is committed to operating and maintaining our polypropylene manufacturing process in a safe and responsible manner.  We have developed and implemented programs to safeguard the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  Our programs not only satisfy applicable standards imposed by government agencies, such as those of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), but also adhere to Braskem's corporate requirements.  We review and, as appropriate, update our Process Hazard Analyses periodically to ensure that process hazards are properly identified, understood, and adequately mitigated.  We also conduct other systematic internal evaluations to ensure the proper maintenance of policies and mitigation controls designed to prevent accidents and releases.  Primary responsibility for safe operation of the facility resides with the facility manager, but this responsibility is shared broadly with all employees through participation in safety related teams, projects, evaluations, and other activities, and through adherence to established policies and procedures.\r\n\r\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nBraskem's Seadrift Operations manufactures polypropylene.  Our final product is transported in railcars or trucks in the form of small pellets which are inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous, and do not burn readily.  Propylene is our primary raw material.  Propylene is flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air in sufficient concentration, and has similar characteristics to propane.  The inventories of propylene and propane in our process are each above the RMP reporting threshold.  Inventories of other flammable materials in our process, such as methane, ethane, ethylene, and hyd"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nKey elements of Braskem's Seadrift Operations accident prevention program include the following:\r\n\r\n- Equipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to  recognized industry standards and/or government requirements.\r\n- Process Safety Information:  Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted to identify potential hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\r\n- Layers of Protection Analysis:  LOPA's are conducted as appropriate in conjunction with process hazard analyses. The protection layers that are established based on the LOPA  are maintained in place to ensure appropriate levels of protection.\r\n- Operating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on the safe operation of the process.\r\n- Operator Training / Certification Program:  A formal training and testing program is used to ensure that operators have the requisite knowledge and information prior to allowing them to take responsibility for operation of the process.\r\n- Maintenance Procedures:  Specific procedures are used for maintaining process equipment in a safe operating condition.\r\n- Mechanical Integrity Program:  Vessels and other process equipment are periodically tested and inspected to ensure safe operation of process equipment, following recognized industry standards and governmental requirements.\r\n- Management of Change:  A management system is used to ensure that facility modifications are considered and evaluated to ensure consistency with safe operating practices.\r\n- Pre-startup Safety Reviews:  Reviews are conducted prior to start-up of new or modified processes.\r\n- I"

Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the last 5 years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at Braskem's Seadrift Operations that resulted in on-site death, injury, or property damage; or known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nBraskem's Seadrift Operations is located in an industrial park within The Dow Chemical Company Seadrift Site.  Emergency Response for the entire Seadrift Site, including the industrial park and Braskem's Seadrift Operations, is coordinated by The Dow Chemical Company Seadrift Site (Seadrift Site).  Some employees of Braskem's Seadrift Operations participate on the emergency response squad for the Seadrift Site.\r\n\r\nThe Dow Chemical Company maintains a written emergency response program for the Seadrift Site to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\r\n\r\n - Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures;\r\n - Plans govern"

The emergency response squad trains and conducts drills to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\r\n\r\nThe Seadrift Site emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed Seadrift Site emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Calhoun County Emergency Planning Committee and the community.  A Mutual Aid Network has been established with Calhoun County and other local chemical plants to further enhance the ability to respond to an emergency.  The Seadrift Site emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes or regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBraskem's Seadrift Operations has been assessed and is a Star rated facility in OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).  Although the Plant has not identified any changes to safety practices necessary to achieve or maintain compliance with any applicable regulatory standard, several projects are currently in-progress to further enhance safety.  These include Building 101 Low Roof Replacement Project, Type IV Reactor Modifier Gas Valve Position Indication & Alarm Project, and Pellet Water Cooler Drain Piping Modification Project."
