      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCrane Gas Plant\nThe Crane Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is\ndemonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering\nsafety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does\noccur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Crane gas plant is located outside of Crane, Texas and processes wet natural gas to produce a dry natural\ngas stream, natural gas liquids and a hydrocarbon condensate oil. The plant has several regulated flammables,\nsuch as methane, ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.\nThe wet natural gas from local oil and gas wells enters the facility at pressures ranging from 5 psig to 600 psig.\nThe gas is compressed to 600 psig via six natural gas fired compressors. Condensate is produces ad the gas is\ncompressed and cooled via aerial coolers. The gas then flows to an amine system that is used to sweeten, or\nremove H2S and CO2 from the sour wet natural gas. The sweetened gas then flows on to the Triethylene Glycol\nContactor (TEG) contactor for dehydration.\nAfter leaving the TEG contactor the gas flows to a molecular (mol) sieve bed system to accomplish the final\ndehydration before entering the cryogenic section of the plant.\nThe sweetened, dehydrated gas is compressed via two natural gas fired compressors to 1000 psig. The gas\nenters the cryogenic section of the plant is cooled by cross exchangers, a propane refrigerant system (<10,000\nlbs of propane), and a turboexpander. The result of this process is that natural gas liquids (NGLs) are removed\nfrom the gas and a dry natural gas streem is produced. NGLs, condensate and the dry natural gas are delivered\nto local pipelines.\nGENERAL ACCIDEN"

New employees receive\nbasic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully\ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and\ntasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to\nperform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all\noperators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and\nknowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conduced at least every 3 years. All\nof this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood\nthe training.\nContractors\nThe Crane Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or\nconstruction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has\nprocedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate\nknowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in\nevent of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any\nhazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process\noverview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4)\nsafe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Crane Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety\nprograms and performance during the selection of a contractor.
