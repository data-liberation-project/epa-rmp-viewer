Albertson's operates many retail grocery stores throughout the West that are supplied through a frozen food distribution center located in Buena Park, California. The Albertson's distribution operation employs approximately 88 people. The Albertson's Frozen Food Distribution Center, located on this facility site, uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the products in storage. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The refrigeration capability at the facility was reduced in 2000 when one of the sections of the property containing a stand alone refrigeration system was sold.  The existing property maintains a refrigeration system; however, the total ammonia inventory onsite has been reduced.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations, Albertson's has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If?/Checklist Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the Buena Park facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm.\n\nAlbertson's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include a preventive maintenance program (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system as well as a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work pr"

Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  The following is a description of the results:\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration\n\nAlbertson's stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in storage.  Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefits to employee safety.  Ammonia at the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system, much as the refrigerant in your car air-conditioner.  The Albertson's Buena Park Distribution Center has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\nThe worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the system, which is located indoors. The analysis of this release indicates that potential public recpetors include schools, residences, and business areas.\n\nIn determining the alternate case scenarios for ammonia, Albertson's analyzed incidents occurring at other refrigeration facilities and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA).  The scenario chosen for the ammonia system assumes a \u00bd\" hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers in each system. Such a release would create the potential to affect residences and a school.  \n\nAlbertson's is committed to minimizing accidental releases of amm"
