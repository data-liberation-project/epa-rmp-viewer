It is the policy of\nMarva Maid Dairy to operate its facility in a manner that will minimize the\nrisk of any accidental release. While not all accidents are preventable, it is\nthe policy of Marva Maid Dairy to take all appropriate steps to minimize the\npossibility and impact of such accidents and releases. These steps include\nthe proper training of our operators, development of safety programs and\noperating procedures and frequent review and refresher training.\nSince Marva Maid Dairy recognizes that there are accidents that may occur\nregardless of the amount of training, planning and program development it\nis also the policy of Marva Maid Dairy to be prepared for any possible\ncontingency. Toward this end Marva Maid Dairy has developed an\nemergency response plan. The local emergency response first response\nagency as well as the Local Emergency Planning Committee has been\ninvolved in ongoing discussion and coordination of this emergency\nresponse plan.\n\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCovered Process:\n\nThe covered process is an ammonia refrigeration system serving a dairy\nfacility providing\nstorage for milk and other dairy products. The refrigeration system has a\npublished\ncharge of 19,750 pounds of Anhydrous. The refrigeration process can be\ndivided into two primary missions:\n\n1. Maintain storage and production areas at approximately 34A?F to 40A?F to\npreserve quality and freshness of the product.\n\n2. Maintain water at approximately 32A?F for use in the various production\nprocesses.\n\nCompressors:\n\nThe system has 7 compressors operating as a single stage system. The\nsystem is designed\nat 78A?F wet bulb and 34 PSIG suction pressure. The screw compressors all\nutilize liquid injection oil cooling. All compressors are stage"

The system has a Hansen\nTechnologies refrigerated Auto-purger to insure the removal of air or other\nnon-condensables and utilizes a treatment system to control algae,\nbacteria, fungus and scaling.\n\nReceivers / Vessels:\n\nThe system has one high pressure receiver and one critical receiver to\ninsure oil cooling for the screw compressors as well as one large recirculating\nreceiver.\n\nEvaporators / Chillers:\n\nThe system utilizes some 15 pump overfed evaporators to provide climate\ncontrol for the entire processing and storage facility. Additionally, there are 2 flooded\nchillers providing chilled water for the processing areas. \n\n3.0 WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nAs part of the Marva Maid Dairy safety program a Process Hazard\nAssessment was completed. As part of this assessment one worst case\nand one alternate case release scenario was completed. RMP*Comp was\nused to calculate the distance to the toxic endpoint for each of these\nscenarios. The impact of this release scenario was assessed using a plot of\nthe resulting distance, developed using Marplot, Landview 6 and the 2000\nCensus data.\n\n3.1 Worst-Case Scenario Description\n\nOne worst case release scenario was developed based on a release of\n5,579 pounds of ammonia from the high pressure receiver. This represents\nthe maximum planned contents of the largest receiver as specified in 40\nCFR 68.25(b)(1). The scenario was calculated using RMP-Comp and was\nbased on the entire contents being released as a vapor over a ten-minute\nperiod resulting in a release rate of 558 pounds per minute. No mitigating\nmeasures were included in the calculation. Additional criteria for the\ncalculation were:\n\nTopography: Urban surroundings\n\nToxic Endpoint: 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\n\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: .9 miles (2.1 kilometers)\n\nThe following assumptions were made in calculating this scenario:\n\nWind Speed: 1.5 meters/seco"

The rational of this scenario is based on an actual\nevent at the facility. The quantity released from a 3/4\" ammonia liquid line\nstruck with a forklift resulted in a release estimated to be 1,330 pounds of\nammonia. The scenario was calculated using RMP-Comp and was based\non the actual observed events. An automatic control system which\nisolated the leaking section is a mitigating measure attributed with\nmaintaining the minimal release quantity. Additional criteria for the\ncalculation were:\n\nCondensing Pressure: 155 psia\nTank Temp: 81A?F\nRelease Rate: 1,330 pounds per min\nMitigation Measures: Automatic isolation control system.\nTopography: Urban surroundings\nToxic Endpoint: 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers)\nWind Speed: 3 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour)\nStability Class: D\nAir Temperature: 77A? F (25 degrees C)\n\nIt was determined that a release of this nature under these conditions\nwould have minimal effect offsite.\n\n4.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn an effort to insure the general safety and well-being of plant personnel as\nwell as the community Marva Maid Dairy has implemented numerous\nsafety and emergency preparedness programs. These include Lock-Out /\nTag Out, Permit Entry Confined Space Entry, Emergency Response, and\nothers. Standard Operating Procedures have been developed to establish\nuniformity and safety in the day to day operations of the refrigeration\nsystem. Additionally, Marva Maid Dairy has developed and implemented a\ncomprehensive training program to insure the kno"

The key element and foundation of the Marva Maid Dairy\nsafety and training programs is the Marva Maid Dairy Risk Management\nand Prevention Program.\n\n5.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the five year period preceding this report there has been one\nrelease from covered processes that resulted in significant property\ndamage on site. This occurred when a forklift struck an ammonia liquid\ntransfer line, breaking the pipe. Approximately 1330 pounds of ammonia\nwere released and significant dairy product was contaminated and had to\nbe destroyed.\n\n6.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nIt is the intent of Marva Maid Dairy to prevent all foreseeable emergencies.\nEmergencies are not completely preventable so this plan defines the\nframework for an effective emergency response. The framework addresses\nsuch issues as training, preparation, assignment of authority, and risk\nassessment. It gives employees procedures to follow for effective and safe\nactions during an emergency, including evacuation.\nThe Marva Maid Dairy emergency response program has specific\nprocedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other\nemergencies. We work in conjunction with the local Fire Department and\nthe Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary\nnotification of all effected neighbors.\n\n7.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a\nlist of action items to improve safety was developed and their status\nmonitored to ensure that implementation is accomplished."
