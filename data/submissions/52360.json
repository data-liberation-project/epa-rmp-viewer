      "SummaryText": "Color biotics\nAmes, Iowa\n\nRMP Executive Summary\n\nThe emergency response plan for the Colorbiotics aqueous ammonia storage tank utilzes the resource of compnay personnel in concert with the local emergency response coorinator and the locat fire and police departments.\n\nIn the event of a release, trained plant personnel will be dispatched to the source to evaluate the situation and to request the desired emergency response personnel.  Once the initial review has been completed, mitigation activiites will be taken to reduce the impact of the release and abatement activiites will be commenced to prevent additional release.\n\nOccupied buildings in the vicinity have been identified and lised such that a coordianted evacuation effort can be conducted with the assurance that all known areas have been checked.\n\nThe locat emergency respnse personnel will be availabe to initiate a controled evacuation plan dicteated by wind direction.  Based on the quantity of material that may be released, different areas of evacuation are anticpated.  A minor release may not required any evacuation, while a complete release of the entire tank contents may require the evacuation of appromiately 20 facilities.\n\nA stepped approach is as follows:\n\n1.  Initiate response\n2.  Evaluate the situation\n3.  Summon response personnel\n4.  Initiate initial mitigation\n5.  Initiate initial abatement\n6.  Initiate evcuation plan\n7.  Continue mitigation and abatement as necessary to return area to safe conditions.\n\nThe toxic endpoint model notes two scenarios for planning with respect to the noted aqueous ammonia tank.  The first scenario is limited to a small gaseous plume of ammonia that migrates 30 yards from the source, which is a significnat distance from any off-site populated areas.  The second scenario notes a toxic endpoint at approximately 1,380 yards from the source that has the potential to impact commerical, medical, and industrial facilities."
