      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPioneer Americas LLC d/b/a Olin Chlor Alkali Products' (Olin) Santa Fe Springs, California, Bleach facility is committed to the safety and well being of its employees, neighboring community, and the environment.  Olin is an active member of the Chlorine Institute, an industry group that develops technology for the safe handling and management of chlorine.   Responsible CareA? is the industry's effort to reach out and dialogue with the public regarding our environmental, health and safety programs and to receive input from the community on issues of concern.  Olin Santa Fe Springs is also a participating member of the Santa Fe Springs area Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) group.\n\nStationary Source\n\nThe site produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic).  These chemicals provide important benefits in critical applications such as water purification and household disinfectants.  Pioneer's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of a hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThis Risk Management Plan has been prepared to address the handling of chlorine at the Olin Santa Fe Springs Bleach facility.\n\nLiquefied chlorine is received in 90-ton rail cars and repackaged into tank trucks.  It is also used in the manufacture of bleach.  Customers use both chlorine and bleach to treat drinking water, wastewater, swimming pool water and industrial water to eliminate and/or prevent the growth of harmful organisms.\n\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nA Worst Case Scenario (WCS) was performed for this facility in 1999 and was reviewed in March 2004 and June 2009.  Per the April 9, 2004, amendment to the RMP rule (69 Fed."

Per the April 9, 2004, amendment to the RMP rule (69 Fed. Reg. 18819) and the RMP*Submit 2004 Help Page, the ARSs are not included in this Executive Summary.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOlin has a comprehensive release prevention program, meeting the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, the Federal RMP Prevention Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  We have physical safeguards in place to prevent a release of chlorine.  We also follow best industry practices for the design and construction of equipment, piping and instrumentation.  Our process design includes expansion bottles and/or rupture disks and pressure switches to safeguard against hydrostatic overpressure of equipment and piping.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been two accidents within the past 5 years.  Both accidents resulted in the release of less than 1 pound of chlorine for less than 1 minute.  The first incident occurred when the operator did not follow written procedures and attempted to remove a valve cap while the valve was open.  The operator immediately closed the valve.  The incident did not trigger the detection alarm, which is set at 1 ppm.\n\nThe second incident occurred when the operator was removing a cylinder from the fill rack.  The operator did not have the fill valve in a fully closed position, resulting in a small release of chlorine fumes.  Valves were replaced with positive locked valves, ensuring valves are fully closed.  The detection alarm indicated 5 ppm in the immediate vicinity of the release.\n\nBoth of the above accidents occurred in the repack process, which is no longer performed at this facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOlin has a compreh"

      "SummaryText": "ensive emergency response program that includes detection, alarm, shutdown and containment systems to halt and/or mitigate a release.  In the unlikely event that a release cannot be controlled completely with these systems, Olin has an Emergency Response Team trained and equipped to respond safely to a release in accordance with a written Emergency Response Plan.  Olin has worked closely with the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department (SFSFD) in developing its Emergency Response Plan.  The SFSFD Hazmat Unit has participated with Pioneer in several training exercises at the Santa Fe Springs facility.\n\n"
