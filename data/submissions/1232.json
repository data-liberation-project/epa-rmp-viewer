Slezak, President\nRisk Management Plan-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n    The owners, management, and employees of Lone Maple Agricultural Services are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Ahydrous Ammonia at our plant. If an accident should occur, the facilty and employees are fully prepared to work with the local fire companies or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to the people and environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n   The primary activity at Lone Maple Agricultural Services is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n   Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending of mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n   The maximum quantity stored would be 102,000 pounds in our two-12,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 150,000 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n          A. Our worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank (or truck) released as a gas over ten minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) is 1.63 miles.\n         B. Our alternative release scenario based on the five-year acciden"

The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n    Our facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Hnadling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910, 111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n    Our facility has had no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility nor, to our knowledge have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damages or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n    Our facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29CFR 1910.38\n     We provided state and local authorties the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n     We have a written emergency response prgram, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910, 120, including pre-emergency planning and employyee training.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at Lone Maple Ag. Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional Anhydrous Ammonia safety recommendations that we plan on implementing at this time."
