The condensate stored on site is low and the substance is not likely to travel off site and will not pose a hazard to the public. In the event of a release, the facility personnel will implement the spill response procedures outlined within the PPC and SPCC plans. \r\nThe closest end point to the Endeavor is an intermittent creek which flows to West Run during seasons that it has water. The creek is located west of the facility and the only possibility of any substance from the Endeavor reaching the intermittent creek would be a simultaneous tank failure and flood. This scenario is highly unlikely but the SPCC outlines proper boom placement and containment procedures if it were to occur.\r\nThe site processes natural gas, which is mostly methane. There is a possibility of a methane release if equipment failure occurs due to a puncture or leak. If a methane release occurs the gas will be released into the air until facility personnel can initiate the emergency shut-off and either divert flow lines or repair equipment. The SPCC and PPC outline proper response procedures for personnel and all personnel are trained regularly in response procedures.\r\n\r\n<> General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe Endeavor facility operates in compliance with the Clean Water Act Regulations at 40 CFR 112, OSHA Regulations at 29 CFR 1910.38 and all state EPCRA rules and laws. Safety and environmental protection are upheld as highly important by all facility personnel and company management in every-day activities as well as during policy creation and company standards. \r\n\r\n<> Five-Year Accident History\r\nThe Endeavor facility does not have any spills or accidents reported within the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n<> Emergency Response Program\r\nThe Endeavor facility has implemented a PPC Plan and SPCC Plan to prepare personnel to respond in a safe, effective, and timely manner to mitigate the impa"

Equipment is regularly monitored and checked to maintain integrity and prevent equipment failure. \r\n\r\n<> Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe primary activities at the Endeavor is natural gas processing. The facility is equipped with multiple pressurized machinery (a.k.a. vessels) that each perform separate functions to convert the raw, produced natural gas from a well into clean, usable and sale-ready natural gas. The equipment utilizes propane and other chemicals to operate. The site does not store any hazardous or extremely hazardous substances above the reportable quantity threshold. The chemicals on site where checked against the List of Lists: Consolidated List of Chemicals Subject to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act to determine if the chemicals were regulated as hazardous.\r\n\r\n<> Worst-Case Release and Alternate Release Scenario(s)\r\nThe Endeavor facility stores a small a"
