      "SummaryText": "A? Executive Sumary\n\n1.  General Information\n\nWastewater is treated at the City of Lubbock Southeast Water Reclamation Plant (SEWRP) to become a reuseable resource.  The treatment process utilizes both physical and biological processes to produce a high quality effluent.  Recognizing the need/value of water on the South Plains, effluent is reused for local/area agricultural, industrial processes, and discharged to the North Fork of the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River.  The local plant is designed to meet Lubbock's needs for the next twenty (20) years and currently treats approximately twenty-one (21) million gallons of wastewater per day.\n\nWastewater treatment yields liquid and solid components.  The solid portion goes through three (3) processes yielding a product which resembles rich black potting soil.  Currently the solid product is disposed of at the City of Lubbock Landfill.  Research indicates this product is rich in nutrients and may be suitable for agricultural uses in the future.\n\nThe liquid component runs through seven (7) distinct treatment processes.  During the primary treatment, bar screens filter out rags, sticks and other large items before they enter the plant.  Primary clarifiers allow 60-75% of the solids contained in the liquid to settle out.\n\nDuring secondary treatment, aeration basins, the heart of the wastewater treatment process, utilize aerobic bacteria to consume materials present in wastewater.  These bacteria are quite sensitive to changes in temperature, hydraulic and biological loading, pH, and oxygen levels.  Therefore, this process must be carefully monitored by highly qualified staff personnel.  Secondary clarifiers allow solids and beneficial bacteria to settle out producing a clear high quality effluent.  A disinfectant, chlorine, is then used to kill pathogenic organisms.\n\nThe City of Lubbock Water Reclamation Lab provides the necessary testing to monitor plant performance at all stages of treatment.  This is a vital ser"

A large portion of the resulting treated effluent is utilized for irrigation at the City's two land application sites.  The remainder of the effluent is purchased by industry for reuse or discharged to the NOrth Fork of the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River.\n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nChlorine is present at the Southeast Water Reclamation Plant (SEWRP).  Chlorine is classified as a toxic chemical under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.  Some of the same properties which  make chorine a valuable and necessary component of the SEWRP's operation also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, including the threat to plant personnel, neighboring citizens of the City of Lubbock, as well as the environment.\n\nIt is the City of Lubbock's policy to strictly adhere to all applicable Federal and State guidelines and regulations. safety depends on the manner in which chlorine is handled at the plant, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures which we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nThe City of Lubbock Fire Department will respond to any major release involving chlorine.  Our Emergency Response Plan (ERP) is based upon available information related to chlorine.  The ERP includes procedures for chemical containment, notification of the City of Lubbock Fire Department and any potentially affected neighbors in the unlikely event of containment and neutralization failure.\n\n3.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handeled\n\nAs described in Section 1, the primary purpose of the SEWRP is to treat wastewater to a point that it becomes a reusable resource.  Chlorine is received in one (1) ton cylinders by truck.  It is placed in a containment building, then utilized in disinfecting"

The RMP regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine. The total inventory of chlorine maintained at the SEWRP is twenty (20) tons.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe SEWRP complies with all applicable Federal and State guidelines, codes, and regulations. This facility is also operated in accordance with recommendations from the Chlorine Institute, Washington D.C.  To prevent accidental release of chlorine to the atmosphere, all chlorine cylinders are enclosed in a ventilation controlled, tornado resistant, storage building.  In the event a chlorine leak occurs, sensors in the storage structure signal actuators to automatically close ventilation ports and activate a scrubber system which evacuates and neutralizes the chlorine from the storage building.  \n     \n5.  Five-Year Accident History\n     \nWithin the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).  No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.  Additionally, uncontrolled runaway reactions may pose a danger to public emergency responder entering the distance-to-endpoint.  Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n6.

More involved releases of chlorine will be responded to by the City of Lubbock Fire Department per the ERP developed by the City of Lubbock Water Utilities Department.  After chlorine cylinders are enclosed within the storage building, a worst case or alternate case release event should be totally contained within the structure, and the released chlorine should be automatically scrubbed.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Southeast Water Reclamation Plant will continue to improve its operations on an ongoing basis.  Chlorine Institute and additional engineering programs will be reviewed to determine that processes being conducted at the facility are in compliance with the latest safety innovations."
