      "SummaryText": "ABE South Dakota, LLC is a fuel ethanol plant operating in Huron, SD.  This facility is able to process approximately 11.4 million bushels of grain per year and produce up to 30 million gallons of denatured ethanol per year. The facility produces dried distillers grains with solids (DDGS) and wet distiller's grains with solids (WDGS) as by-products.  \n\n\n\nGrain is received by truck and dumped into an enclosed receiving pit or delivered by conveyor. The grain is transported from the receiving pit to grain storage bins. The grain is then transported from the grain storage bins to a hammer mill. The hammer mill grinds the grain into flour which is blended with hot water and enzymes to produce a mash.  The mash is pumped to the fermentation process. In the fermentation process, yeast and enzymes are added to the mash to convert the starch to sugars, which are then converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The resulting liquid (beer) contains ethanol. After approximately 50 hours, the beer in the fermentation tank(s) is pumped to a beer well.    \n\n\n\nIn the distillation process, the beer from the beer well is pumped to the top of the beer column (stripper) and is heated by vapors from the Evaporators. The ethanol vaporizes and is collected in the rectifier, producing approximately 187-190 proof ethanol (93% ethanol and 7% water). Where it then is pumped to either the 190 holding take or to the 190 reflux tank, where it may be pumped back to the rectifier to help \"proof up\" the alcohol vapors. The 190 proof ethanol is superheated and sent to one of three molecular sieve beds where the remaining water is removed to produce 200 proof ethanol (100% ethanol). The 200 proof ethanol is condensed and pumped to outside storage tanks.\n\n\n\nThese outside storage tanks contain up to 200,000 gallons of denatured ethanol and are exempt from the CAA 112(r)(7)'s Risk Management Program.  The contents of these tanks does not meet the NFPA -4 criteria. Information found on the MSDS indicates t"

      "SummaryText": "hat Denatured Ethanol has an NFPA flammability rating of 3 (NFPA-3).  ABE South Dakota, LLC follows the general duty provisions to operate the Denatured Ethanol safely under the CAA 112(r)(1) (the General Duty Clause).\n\n\n\nThe 200 proof ethanol is denatured with gasoline. Denaturing is required to render the ethanol unfit for human consumption. The gasoline used may either be unleaded gasoline or natural gasoline (sometimes referred to as well head gasoline or well head drip gas). The facility has chosen natural gasoline, due to restrictions on specifications of impurities for fuel ethanol in some states. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole stillage (beer without the ethanol) is processed through centrifuges to produce thin stillage and a solid fraction. The thin stillage is sent to an evaporator where the water is evaporated to produce a syrup containing about 27 to 30 percent solids. The syrup is added with the solid fraction, which is referred to as wet distiller's grain and solids (WDGS). This WDGS contains approximately 65 percent moisture and is sold as animal feed or refined through an additional process to produce dried distillers grains with solids (DDGS). When producing DDGS, the WDGS is sent processed through a dryer producing a 12 percent moisture product. This 12 percent moisture product is referred to as DDGS and is also sold as animal feed. \n\n\n\nFor ABE South Dakota, LLC, this RMP is completed for the anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks and the denaturant storage tank along with associated piping, pumps and metering controls. \n\n\n\nABE South Dakota, LLC has an active preventive maintenance program that incorporates the inspection of the natural gasoline (denaturant) storage tank and the associated piping and equipment.  In an effort to assure protection of the environment, the denaturant tank is situated in a bermed area to provide secondary containment for the denaturant tank contents in the event of an accidental uncontrolled release.

In the event of a large release of denaturant, the Plan calls for contacting two local construction company's with the equipment to build additional dikes and containment, as necessary.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the physical protection of secondary containment, there is also a fusible link valve on the denaturant tank.  This valve closes in the event of a fire, preventing the tank to drain through a damaged header or ruptured pipe.  The facility also maintains a portable trailer with a fire-fighting foam eductor capable of connecting to a fire hydrant to foam flammable liquid fires.  This trailer has been made available for local fire department use in the event of a community emergency.\n\n \n\nABE South Dakota, LLC also has a Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  We believe this is another tool to enhance employee safety programs, protect the environment and continue safe operation of equipment.  As a rule, very few hazardous chemicals are stored on site in a quantity to cause significant problems in a release situation.  ABE South Dakota, LLC actively trains employees on chemical use, hazard communication and handling procedures. In addition, as part of this program, ABE South Dakota went through an extensive pre-startup safety review.

This tank contents are used to denature ethanol to render it unfit for human consumption.  \n\n\n\nABE South Dakota, LLC is subject to and complies with several federal and state regulations.
