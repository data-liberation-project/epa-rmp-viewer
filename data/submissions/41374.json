      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis technical study was conducted for Wm. Bolthouse Farms, Inc. (Bolthouse Farms) to fullfil the Hazard Assessment (Off-Site Consequence Analysis) requirements of the following regulations:\n\nEPA's 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Program (RMP)\nCCR Title 19, Div. 2, California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program\n\nThe only regulated substance on-site is anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant in the facility's refrigeration system.\n\nThe Bolthouse Farms facility is located at 29750 Highway 58, in Buttonwillow, California. The immediate area is primarily light industrial and agricultural. \n\nThe facility uses approximately 28,000(~5,100 gallons) of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system. The system, consisting of piping, valves and equipment, cycles ammonia througe various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, high pressure vapor, low pressure vapor and back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for various process equipment including hydrocoolers and chillers as well as evaporators for cold storage.\n\nThere is a single ammonia refrigeration system at the Bolthouse Farms, West facility. The facility was origionallly constructed in 1997 under the ownership of Golden Valley Produce, LLC. Bolthouse Farms purchased the facility in 1999 and made several modifications and upgrades to the system prior to re-starting the system in December 1999\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at Bolthouse Farms West Facility within the last five Years."
