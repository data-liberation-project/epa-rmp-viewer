Since it is a new facility there is very little historical data to report.\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt El Dorado Nitrogen Company, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes \n(especially those involving hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner. We use a\ncombination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment. El Dorado\nNitrogen Company maintains an open dialogue with primary emergency responders. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have \ndesigned and implemented, including the following:\n\nA description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process,\nwhich are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Planning (RMP) Regulation.\n\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases.\n\nAn overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\nA accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP rule, since the plant was commissioned which indicates there were no incidents.\n\nAn overview of the Emergency Response Program.\n\nThe certifications that EPA requires us to provide, with regard to RMP.\n\nThe detailed information (called data elements) about our Risk Management Program.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur facility's primary activity involves the production of nitric acid.  This product is used in the agricultural and specialty chemical manufacturing industries.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals in the threshold quantities that EPA has identified on the RMP Toxic Substances List:\n\nTOXIC SUBSTANCES                          "

This vessel will be inspected on a scheduled basis utilizing an ultra-sonic testing method, which verifies the mechanical integrity of the tank.  The vessel is carbon steel and designed for 360 psig MAWP.  It is normally operated at 140 psig.  The worst case was developed using Class F atmospheric stability (1.5 m/s wind speed conditions) and does not account for any active mitigation measures.  Furthermore, we have not experienced an ammonia release from this vessel since initial startup.  Related data is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nRelease Rate -                                                      1,380 lbs./min\nDuration of Release -                                           10 minutes\nMeteorology -                                                       25 degrees C / 50% RH (Class F)\nOff-Site Consequence -                                        1.5 miles\nToxic Endpoint -                                                   0.14 mg/l\n\nALTERNATE CASE - AMMONIA:  This alternate case scenario involves a release from a pressure relief valve in an ammonia evaporator.\n\nRelease Rate -                                                      90.8 lbs./min\nDuration of Release -                                           26 minutes\nMeteorology -                                                      25 degrees C / 50% RH (Class D)\nOff-Site Consequence -                      "

Also, El Dorado Nitrogen Company parallels the RMP rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nEl Dorado Nitrogen Company, Baytown, Texas, maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"HAZOP\".  These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.  Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, El Dorado Nitrogen Company maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-up, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and start-up after a turn-around.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nEl Dorado Nitrogen Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

Process Technicians, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly trained, and are an integrated part of the change order process.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at El Dorado Nitrogen Company.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEl Dorado Nitrogen Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determing whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nEl Dorado Nitrogen Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a release of a regulated substance.
