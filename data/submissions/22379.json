Its policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous material from occurring, to provide early detection of a release in the unlikely event that one would occur, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to address the hydrofluoric acid process at the Alloys Cleaning, Inc. facility located at 1922 E. Gage Street, Los Angeles, CA 90001.\n\nc. The worst case release which was modeled was the release of the entire contents of the largest container of 70 % hydrofluoric acid. The alternate release scenario was taken to be the same scenario modeled under less pessemistic meterological conditions. Both scenarios have offsite impacts. No credit for measures to prevent and/or mitigate such a release was taken.\n\nd. A prevention program is in place meeting the regulatory requirements for a Program 2 Risk Management Program. Physical safeguards to prevent a release include best industry practices for the design and construction of vessels, equipment, and piping, safety shutdown systems, and various procedural safeguards.\n\ne. This is a new process and there have been no accidents involving hydrofluoric acid within the five (5) years prior to submission of this RMP.\n\nf. The hydrofluoric acid operations invlove delivery of drums, unloading to a contained area protected by a scrubbing system, and use in dip tanks in the same area. Delivery and transfer is supervised and both delivery and facility personnel are tarined and equipped to deal safely with spills. If it is determined that the situation requires emergency response per Cal-OSHA regulations, Title 8, Section 5192, Los Angeles County Fire Department will be summoned, neighbors notified and the facility will be promptly and safely evacuated.\n\ng.
