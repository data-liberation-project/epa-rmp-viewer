THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 280,000 POUNDS IN THREE SEPARATE TANKS,A TWELVE THOUSAND GALLON,A EIGHTEEN THOUSAND GALLON,AND A THIRTY THOUSAND GALLON TANK.THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF PRODUCT OUT AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES OUT OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK,AT 85 % CAPACITY.THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF DISPERSION BASED ON THE MODEL USED IS 1.16 MILES.THE ALTERNATIVE-CASE SCENARIO IS THE ASSUMPTION TO BE A RELEASE FROM A RUPTURED THREE INCH PIPELINE,WITH 26,638 POUNDS RELEASED OVER TWO MINUTES.THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF DISPERSION IS .78 MILES. THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH THE RULES AND REGULATION RELATING TOTHE HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THESE REGULATIONS ADMINISTERED BY THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ARE CONSISTENT WITH ANSI K61.1 AND OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 REGARDING STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THIS FACILITY. PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE NEEDS AND THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE EQUIPMENT.  SAFE OPERATIONS OF THE MATERIAL HANDLING AND STORAGE AT THE FACILITY ARE ALSO DISCUSSED.THE ONLY ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO UPDATE THE EMERGENCY RESPOSE PROGRAM."
