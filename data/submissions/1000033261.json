Beaumont, Texas facility to reduce the risks associated with accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals. This Risk Management Plan summarizes the managerial, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases. The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan definitions and requirements.\n\n\n\n*Introduction\n\n*Arkema Inc., Policies to Protect Health, Environmental, and Safety\n\n*Facility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes\n\n*General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n*Five-Year Accident History\n\n*Emergency Response Plan\n\n* Planned Changes to improve safety (need to include)\n\n\n\nARKEMA INC., POLICIES FOR HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\n\n\n\nArkema Inc., is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety by conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive risk management program that covers equipment design, installation, operating procedures, preventive maintenance, and employee training associated with processes at the Beaumont plant. The Risk Management Plan formalizes the management system that documents these activities.\n\n\n\nThis commitment to health, environment, and safety (HES) starts with the Chief Executive Officer. Senior\n\nManagement routinely dedicates time to review HES matters. This emphasis on safety is carried on at all\n\nlevels of the plant. The Beaumont plant has a safety committee that meets monthly to discuss HES topics.\n\nThe success of the plant's HES program is also demonstrated by a strong commitment to safety by our\n\nemployees and site contractors.\n\n\n\nArkema Inc., HES programs include policies, procedures, standards, and guidance materi"

This facility\n\ncurrently manufactures Methyl Mercaptan and Ethyl Mercaptan. Methyl Mercaptan is used to produce\n\nphotographic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and Methionine, a synthetic amino acid used in animal feed\n\nsupplement. Ethyl Mercaptan is used to produce agrichemicals such as biodegradable herbicides and\n\npesticides. Certain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated substances under 40 CFR 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule. An RMP has been previously filed with the EPA and presented to the public. Methyl Mercaptan, Hydrogen Sulfide, Carbon Disulfide, Ethyl Mercaptan and Acrolein are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.  Acrolein is used as an intermediate product to manufacture Methylmercaptoproprialdehyde (MMP). MMP is formed by reacting\n\nMeSH and Acrolein.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Arkema Inc. Beaumont plant has an accidental release prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases. This program is designed to address the requirements of the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68. The accident prevention program includes the following elements and activities:\n\n\n\nIn-depth process hazard analysis studies conducted every five years for existing units by personnel\n\nknowledgeable with the process. The team utilizes study techniques approved under the OSHA Process\n\nSafety Management Standard. \n\n\n\nWritten operating"

All personnel working in a covered process have been certified to work their jobs.\n\n\n\nA Management of Change Program is in place to ensure that process operating changes are managed safely and that no additional risks result from the change.\n\n\n\nCritical equipment is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to ensure safe operating conditions.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews are conducted by plant personnel on all changes that affect the Process Safety\n\nInformation.\n\n\n\nRoutine investigation of incidents is conducted as part of continuous improvement.\n\n\n\nRoutine audits are conducted of the Process Safety Management System to ensure the standard is being met.\n\n\n\nAll equipment including, pressure vessels, piping systems, pumps, compressors, and instrumentation are\n\ndesigned in accordance with industry codes and standards.\n\n\n\nA safety permitting system is in place to control work activity.\n\n\n\nA process control system is monitored on a 24 hour basis by plant personnel.\n\n\n\nThe multiple layers of preventive and mitigation measures are currently in use at the Beaumont plant makes it very unlikely that a significant release would occur. In the unlikely event that such a release occurs, Arkema Inc. has mitigation measures in place to reduce potential impacts to the community.\n\nSpecific chemical mitigation measures include:\n\n\n\n* Fixed water deluge systems on storage vessels and stationary fire monitors that can be used to suppress\n\nvapor\n\n* Mechanical Integrity Program\n\n* Trained Emergency Response Team on-site at all times\n\n* Member of area Mutual-Aid organization\n\n* Vapor Scrubbing System\n\n* Flare System\n\n* Excess Flow Valves on Storage Tanks\n\n* Dikes\n\n* Emergency Shutdown Systems\n\n* Area Gas Detectors\n\n* Planned Inspection Programs\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Beaumont facility had one incident on 5/2/2011 at 10:50 AM in the B1 process unit.

      "SummaryText": "The incident was a Hydrogen Sulfide release and fire from a valve stem failure.  The site shut down the road and informed the scrape yard across from the plant to shelter in place as a precaution until fence line  monitoring was preformed.  The road was reopened within 15 minutes once the monitoring confirmed that no hazard existed.  The incident was investigated and all action items found have been closed.\n\n\n\nEMERGENVCY RESPONSE STATEMENT\n\nThe Arkema Inc. Beaumont facility maintains a written Site Emergency Response Plan. The plan includes the procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an accidental release. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are maintained to provide appropriate medical treatment and first aid necessary in response to accidental human exposures. All employees and contractors are trained in the plan and drills are conducted on an annual basis. The plan provides response guidelines for employees to use to respond to liquid spills, gas releases, and fires. The plan is updated as necessary based on review of incidents or drills.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Arkema Inc. Beaumont facility is currently installing automated controls to reduce operator intervention and risk, based on latest PHA recommendations.  The site has various capital projects to replace and upgrade vessels and piping with better metallurgy, to improve mechanical integrity reliability of existing vessels and piping systems,   The facility has added and continues to modify testing and maintenance procedures for critical instrumentation and equipment, based upon PHA and incident investigation recommendations.   \n\n"
