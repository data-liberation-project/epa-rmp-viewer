If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n\n\nThe LLC periodically retains OUTSIDE contractors who utilize a mobile unit for the production of ammoniated polyphosphate liquids.  The LLC is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does the LLC own the conversion equipment.  The liquid fertilizer grade produced during the conversion process is 10-34-00.  Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water. The anhydrous ammonia used in the conversion process is brought onto the facility in a semi transport. The anhydrous ammonia is on site temporarily:  the anhydrous ammonia is never off-loaded into a permanent storage container at the LLC.  Therefore this RMP is being filed as a Predictive Filing.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThe LLC has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture Administrative Rules, and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. LLC employees are not involved with the conversion process-the contractor utilizes their own employees. The contractors have provided the LLC with documentation to support a mechanical integrity program is in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan, and a training program for the conversion process.  \n\n\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": " been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia at the facility.  Accident histories referenced in Section 8 solely relate to the respective contractors only and did not happen at the NW Agronomy LLC physical site. \n\n\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe LLC has:\n\na. A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standards. The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release. The EAP plan was last updated in July 2016 and reviewed by site employees in July 2016 as well.  A site  Incident Response Plan (per Minnesota Department of Agricultural requirements) is also in place.

Their portable or mobile mix units carry a PSM/RMP manual and it would be on site at all times during the conversion process.  Both contractors have a company Emergency Action Plan and a Field Emergency Procedure/Plan.  \n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Currently, there are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation.  \n\n"
