Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Facility:\r\n\r\nManagement and employees of NW Agronomy Company LLC, Welcome, MN location (hereinafter LLC), are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information:\r\n\r\nThe LLC periodically retains OUTSIDE contractors who utilize a mobile unit for the production of ammoniated polyphosphate liquids.  The LLC is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does the LLC own the conversion equipment.  The liquid fertilizer grade produced during the conversion process is 10-34-00.  Raw materials used in the conversion process include anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water. The anhydrous ammonia used in the conversion process is brought onto the facility in a semi transport. The anhydrous ammonia is on site temporarily:  the anhydrous ammonia is never off-loaded into a permanent storage container at the LLC.  Therefore this RMP is being filed as a Predictive Filing.\r\n\r\n3.
