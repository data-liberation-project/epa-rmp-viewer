      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe people at Flambeau River Papers are committed to operating in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public and the environment.   Our environmental policy states:\nWe will continually identify, evaluate and control the risks associated with our operations.  We shall have procedures in place to prevent and respond to emergencies.\n\nAs part of this commitment, we have established a system to ensure the safe storage, handling and use of dangerous chemicals used in our manufacturing operations.  One component of that system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage chemical risks, and which complies with the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency?s Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  \n\nOne of the RMP rule requirements is the preparation of a risk management plan (RMPlan) which identifies certain dangerous chemicals possessed in quantities exceeding specified thresholds, and which describes the plans in-place to manage the risks to the public that they present.  This document is intended to satisfy that RMPlan requirement and to provide the public with a description of the chemical risk management program at the Flambeau River Papers mill.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Strategy\n\nOur chemical risk management plan consists of numerous policies and procedures intended to minimize the risk that dangerous chemicals pose to our employees and the public.  In general, they are:\n\n1. We limit the use of dangerous chemicals by first considering less dangerous alternatives.  When a dangerous chemical is selected for use we consider the potential harmful affects to our employees and the public, and take steps to eliminate or minimize the risks identified \n \n2. We prevent releases of the dangerous chemicals we use.  When a dangerous chemical is used, we design, build, operate and maintain appropriate facilities and equipment.   All employees using dangerous chemicals a"

We train all our employees in basic emergency procedures, and maintain an in-house \"level-A\" hazardous material (HAZMAT) team to actively intervene in all dangerous chemical emergencies.  In addition, we train for emergencies with local emergency response agencies, and participate actively on the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nRMP Rule-Covered Dangerous Chemicals In Use \n\nThe mill is a partially integrated pulp and paper manufacturing facility.  To produce sulfite chemical pulp we use the following dangerous chemical in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule:\n\n                                Chemical                                                Maximum Quantity On Site\n                              Sulfur Dioxide                                                         56,500 lbs\n                          \n\nOffsite Consequence Analyses\n\nWe have performed mathematical modeling exercises to estimate the off-site consequences of a release of sulfur dioxide from our mill.  The analyses include both worst-case, and more realistic, alternative release models.  Given the chemical risk management program in-place, the likelihood of a worst-case release scenario occurring is extremely remote.  The alternative scenarios selected are ones that could conceivably happen and which have the potential for significant off-site consequences. \n\nThe objective of performing the off-site consequence analyses are to determine the distances from the mill where danger to the public might occur because of an accidental release (called the end-point distance) so that local emergency response agencies can complete the necessary emergency response planning.  \n\nSulfur Dioxide Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for sulfur dioxide is the complete discharge of our 56,500 lb. storage tank over a 10-minute period.  That event"

In that event, approximately 444 lbs. of sulfur dioxide would escape in the 30 seconds required for the personnel present to respond.  That event would place an estimated 210 people at risk within the ? mile end point distance circle.\n\nAccidental Chemical Release Prevention Program\n\nThe accidental chemical release program at the Flambeau River Papers - Park Falls mill consists of these elements:\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nWe maintain a variety of technical, operating and engineering materials that are used for training our employees and as a reference resource to help ensure the safe use of sulfur dioxide. \n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA)\n\nWe perform and periodically update systematic PHAs of the sulfur dioxide system to help identify and eliminate system, equipment and process hazards that could cause an accidental release. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWe use detailed operating and maintenance procedures to train our employees in the safe performance of their work, and to serve as an on-going reference guide.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nWe conduct periodic compliance audits to verify that our risk management system is   operating as intended, and in compliance with the RMP rule.  All deficiencies identified in the audit are corrected promptly.\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nWe investigate all incidents that cause, or might have caused, a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide to the environment.  The results are documented and appropriate corrective measures implemented.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nWe have had no accidents that resulted in the release of sulfur dioxide in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWe have a written emergency response plan that complies with the RMP rule and which has been communicated to the Price County an"

Chlorine was still needed as a disinfecting agent at the wastewater treatment plant for several years following; however, chlorine has since been removed from the facility."
