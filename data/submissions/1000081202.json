This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our standing practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated flammable substances. However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will take appropriate action to control/mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Milfay Gas Plant located near Milfay, Oklahoma uses cryogenic fractionation to separate ethane and heavier hydrocarbons from raw wellhead gas to produce marketable natural gas. As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances are processed, recovered, and stored at the facility (e.g. methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane, and n-pentane).\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the plant. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accidental prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Milfay Gas Plant encourages employees to participate in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created a"

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives in place that address process safety and employee safety issues.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Milfay Gas Plant keeps a variety or technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The Engineering Department, in conjunction with plant personnel, is assigned the responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, pressure) in the plant's Operating Procedures. The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems). Also, the gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \r\n\r\nThe Milfay Gas Plant primarily uses the HAZOP/What-If analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as we'll as accident prevention and mitigation measures and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are sent to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by the report written by the PHA team. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.
