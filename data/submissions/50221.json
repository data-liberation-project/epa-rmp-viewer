      "SummaryText": "Niacet Corporation(Niacet) began as a semi commercial chemical plant based on acetylene in 1924. Tha\ncompany is a privately owned corporation with approximately 85 employees. The facility operates 24 hours\na day 365 days per year. The facility occupies 19 acres in a commercial/industrial area. The Niacet facility\nis bordered by property owned by Praxair Corporation to theEast. It is bordered by Niagara Falls Boulevard to the North and 47th Street to the West, and Simmons avenue to the South. The nearest residential area is approximately 0.5 miles to the NW.\nNiacet is a major producer of metal organic acid salts such as calcium propionate, sodium acetate, and sodium phenoxyacetate (SPA) which is used in the fermentation of penicillin. Niacet produces monochloroacetic acid which is a raw material for SPA, and is also sold on the merchant market. Chlorine is used to make monochloroacetic acid. Ethyl ether is used to manufacture SPA and anionic surfactants. Chlorine is received via railcar and transferred through a vaporizer into 1 of 2 reactors for the production of monochloroacetic acid. Niacet can have up to 2 railcars on site for a total maximum amount of 360,000 lbs. Safety systems include chlorine sensors,automatic shutoff valves, and video monitors.\nEthyl ether is received via tank truck an dstored in one of 2 14,000 gallon storage tanks.In total the 2 tanks can store up to approximately 170,000 lbs. Ethyl ether is used in the manufacture of SPA and anionic surfactants. The ethyl ether is a processing aid which is recycled and reused in these processes. Safety systems include heat sensors that can activate a water deluge system and LEL monitors and alarms. \nNiacet has a management system in place to oversee the implementation of the RMP program elements. The Manager, Quality Assurance & Regulatory Affairs has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP program elements.

      "SummaryText": "airs reports directly to the Co-Managing Directors. He may assign responsibility of individual elements to qualified individuals identified in the Niacet organizational chart. Niacet is committed to operate our Niagara Falls based facility in a safe and responsible manner. Our long history of no off site releases of regulated chemicals speaks for itself. This is due to the layers of safeguards in place to prevent the release of hazardous substances. In the unlikely event of a chemical release, comprehensive emergency response plans are in place to bring any situation to a safe resolution. Niacet meets regularly with emergency responders, and conducts ongoing training of employees and emergency responders to be prepared in the unlikely event of an emergency situation.\nAccident prevention is a key element of our RMP plan. We take a systematic/ proactive approach to preventing the accidental release of hazardouds chemicals. Niacet's RMP plan includes the adoption of OSHA's accidental release prevention program. Some key elements include: Operating Procedures, Process Safety Information, Process Hazards Analysis, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits, Management of Change, Contractor Management, Prestart up review, and Employee Participation. Continual im provement is key to our sucess. This includes our joint Union/Management safety comittee, review of plant procedures, near misses, incident investigation programs, solicitation of suggestions, and the maintenance of regularly scheduled comprehensive saftey meetings."
