Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of AgriServices of Brunswick (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to     farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct     application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n    Propane is stored at a separate site in one-18,000 gallon gallon storage tank and is used     for grain drying. It's maximum quantity is 56,610 pounds.    \nAnhydrous ammonia and propane are stored at the facility in 2 storage tanks 12,000 gallons (ammonia), 18,000 gallons (propane). The maximum quantity for ammonia is 51,000 pounds.\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 51,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.5 miles.  \n        Propane- The maximum quantity released would be 56,610 pounds. The distance             to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.3 miles, or 1,580 feet.\n\n    b.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most         likely     potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose. A                 maximum quantity of     26,640 pound"

The distance to the endpoint (point of             dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.  \n        Propane- The alternate release scenario is a release from a hose rupture caused \n        by a pull-away and assumes a 25-foot length of 4-inch transfer hose. The active             mitigation decices are assumed to function as designed, limiting the release to the         contents of the hose.  The maximum quantity released would be 69 pounds.  the             distance to the end point (point of 1 psi overpressure) is 0.03 miles, or 175 feet.\n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The applicable standard for propane is NFPA-58. The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propanein the past \nfive years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c.    a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard \n29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training"
