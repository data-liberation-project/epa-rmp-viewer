      "SummaryText": "A. Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nInter-Pac Incorporated is a specialty foam manufacturing facility which produces polyethylene (PE) foam, and structural polystyrene (SPS) foam.The PE foam manufacturing process also includes a laminated PE foam process.\n\nPolyethylene foam or \"PE\" foam is a plastic product made of polythylene resin that can be produced in various thicknesses and colors and rolled to different lengths. This process involves mixing resin with reclaimed product and additives, extrusion of the mixed resin through a highly specialized plastic extruder; adding a liquid blowing agent (isobutane), then cooling the material and forcing it through a die. The isobutane is stored at the tank storage area in (2) 6,000 gallon, and (1) 7,000 gallon storage tank(s).\n\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of Inter-Pac\n\nInter-Pac is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public, and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards. Appropriate responses to releases of Isobutane is documented in the Risk Management Program document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\nC. Release Scenario Discussion\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP regulations, the owner or operator is required to perform the following off-site consequence analysis:\n* One worst-case release scenario to represent all regulated flammable substances held in excess of the threshold quantity. A worst-case release scenario was conducted for Isobutane.\n* One alternative release scenario for regulated flammable substances held in excess of the threshold quantity. An alternative release scenario was conducted for Isobutane.\n\nInter-Pac used the RMPComp program to establish the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario.

      "SummaryText": "und in the RMPlan.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined by a major release of Isobutane. A major release from 3 tanks would be 64,440 pounds. A release of this nature is highly unlikely due to the storage location and tank design. The results are presented in Section 4 of the RMPlan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario was based on a leak involving Isobutane. It was determined that the approximate release of one (1) pound per minute, for eighteen hours, was most probable. This would lead to a release of Approximately 1,080 pounds of Isobutane. The results are presented in Section 5 of the RMPlan.\n\nD. Five-year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, significant property damage off-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\" Within the past five (5) years, Inter-Pac has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\n\nE. Management System\n\nInter-Pac has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program (RMProgram) to qualified individuals or positions of responsibility. It clearly delineates and delegates responsibilities.\n\nF. Prevention Program Elements\n\nThe Prevention Program Elements include facility and safety information. Training is an integral part of accident/incident prevention. Training material for Inter-Pac can be found in the RMProgram Manual. New employees working with a covered process receive initial training in accordance with 40 CFR 68.54. The training includes an overview of the process and emphasizes safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and the emergency action plan. Refresher training is porvided at a minimum of annually to all employees involved in working with a covered process. Documentation is "

      "SummaryText": "maintained for each employee to ensure that he/she received and understood the required training.\n\nCompliance Safety Audits - RMP compliance is confirmed through an annual RMP audit that is performed at least once every three years in accordance with 40 CFR 68.58. The audits are completed by at least one person knowledgeable in the process. The safety audits are maintained on site in the safety manager's office.\n\nIncident Investigation - Specific incident investigation, reporting, and documentation procedures have been implemented and are followed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.60 in response to any incident involving a covered process that did or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. Under EPA RMP, a catastrophic release is defined as a major uncontrolled emission, fire, or explosion involving one or more regulated substances that presents imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.\n\nThe incident investigation procedure is initiated as soon as possible and no later than 48 hours following the incident. A team is established to perofrm the incident investigation and always includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process, a contract employee if the incident involves work by a contractor, and persons with  appropriate qualifications to investigate an incident/accident.\nFollowing the investigatioin, a written report is prepared summarizing the following information at a minimum: date of the incident, date the investigation began, description of the incident and any contributing factors, and any recommendations resulting from the investigation. When completed, all affected personnel, including contract employees, review the report. Incident investigation reports are maintained at the facility for a minimum of five (5) years."
