Ammonia at greater than 20% is stored at the Ammonia Treatment Plant and is covered by Prevention Program 2.  Hydrogen is currently stored in a single location within the facility and covered by Prevention Program 3. \n \nPrevention Program Level 2:  Ammonia Treatment Plant\n\nThe Process Hazard Review (PHR) Team for Ammonia Treatment Plant is comprised of the following: Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer (team leader), Safety representative, Treatment Plant operator, Controls Technician, and Design Firm representatives.  The results of each PHR are recorded and maintained on file.\n\nOperating procedures for the Ammonia Treatment Plant were originally written by the manufacturer and design firms, with input from Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and involved employees using technical process descriptions and process safety information.  Operating procedures, as specified in the Ammonia Treatment Plant Operations O+ M Manual are available from Environmental Regulatory Engineering D/9XMA and Environmental Engineering and Operations, D/92D.\n\nTraining for the Ammonia Treatment Plant Operation is formulated and tracked by the  Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and training records are maintained by managers of D/9XMA and D92D.\n\nIncident investigation program follows the IBM incident report procedure in the Safety & Health Manual for fact determination, root cause analysis and recommendation implementation.\n\nA maximum of 150,000 pounds of aqueous ammonia (25%) are in"

Operator refresher training and system update training are conducted as prescribed in the operator training program.  All incidents are investigated to determine root cause and system deficiency correction.\n\nNo accidents/incidents have occurred  involving The Ammonia Treatment Plant in the past 5 years.\n\nIBM is currently scheduled to complete upgrades to Ammonia Treatment Plant by 12/31/2008 as recommended by the Process Hazard Review dated 12/06/2007. \n\nPrevention Program Level 3:  Hydrogen Storage\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for Hydrogen Storage is conducted on a five year schedule by the Process Hazard Analysis Team.  The PHA team for Hydrogen is comprised of the following: Gas Engineer (team leader), Safety representative for gases, Gas Technician, representatives from site manufacturing organizations, Emergency Control representative, and Air Products (Vendor Engineer). \n\nOperating procedures for Hydrogen Storage were written by the Gas Engineer using technical process descriptions and process safety information, and with input from the involved employees.  Operating procedures, as specified in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Documentation for the Hydrogen System, are available from Site Gas Operations (D/01EA).
