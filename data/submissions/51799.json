Ammonia at greater than 20% is stored at the Ammonia Treatment Plant and is covered by Prevention Program 2.  Hydrogen is currently stored in a single location within the facility and covered by Prevention Program 3. \n \nPrevention Program Level 2:  Ammonia Treatment Plant\n\nThe Process Hazard Review (PHR) Team for Ammonia Treatment Plant is comprised of the following: Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer (team leader), Safety representative, Treatment Plant operator, Controls Technician, and Design Firm representatives.  The results of each PHR are recorded and maintained on file.\n\nOperating procedures for the Ammonia Treatment Plant were originally written by the manufacturer and design firms, with input from Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and involved employees using technical process descriptions and process safety information.  Operating procedures, as specified in the Ammonia Treatment Plant Operations O+ M Manual are available from Environmental Regulatory Engineering D/9XMA and Environmental Engineering and Operations, D/92D.\n\nTraining for the Ammonia Treatment Plant Operation is formulated and tracked by the  Ammonia Treatment Plant Engineer and training records are maintained by managers of D/9XMA and D92D.\n\nIncident investigation program follows the IBM incident report procedure in the Safety & Health Manual for fact determination, root cause analysis and recommendation implementation.\n\nA maximum of 150,000 pounds of aqueous ammonia (25%) are in"

The PHA team for Hydrogen is comprised of the following: Gas Engineer (team leader), Safety representative for gases, Gas Technician, representatives from site manufacturing organizations, Emergency Control representative, and Air Products (Vendor Engineer). \n\nOperating procedures for Hydrogen Storage were written by the Gas Engineer using technical process descriptions and process safety information, and with input from the involved employees.  Operating procedures, as specified in the Process Safety Management (PSM) Documentation for the Hydrogen System, are available from Site Gas Operations (D/01EA).  The operating procedures are documented as Bulk Gas Procedures or as Desk References.. \n\nTraining for Hydrogen Storage formulated and tracked by the Gas Engineer and training records are maintained by the manager of D/01EA.\n  \nIncident investigation program follows the IBM incident report"

The program consists of equipment lists and specifications, equipment history, and preventative maintenance procedures. \n\nHot work permits for work on the hydrogen system are issued by IBM (Emergency Control) or Air Products.  These permit issuing processes includes a safety inspection of  the area.  \n\nQuality assurance of the Management of Change (MOC) program for Hydrogen is provided  by the Hydrogen Storage Process Safety Management (PSM) Owner.  The MOC is composed of a written program with elements delegated to appropriate members of the PSM team.  A copy of the documentation is maintained for the life of the process. \n\nQuality assurance of the hydrogen pre-startup review program is provided by the Hydrogen Storage  PSM Owner.  Documentation is maintained as part the MOC program.  \n\nA Maximum of 44,000 lbs of hydrogen is inventoried to produce semiconductor and related products.\n\nThe overpressure end point from a worse case release of hydrogen has been calculated to be 0.3 miles  using the RMP*Comp model.\n\nThe overpressure end point from the alternate release case  for hydrogen has been calculated to be 0.2 miles using the RMP*Comp model.\n\nRelease prevention of hydrogen includes the use of mass flow monitoring, automatic shutoff valves, interlocks, alarms and procedures.  Operator refresher training and system update training are conducted as prescribed in the operator training program.  The maintenance program inspections and tests are performed to assure operation of the prevention devices.  Management of change is monitored by the Process Safety Management Coordinator to assure the program is updated and implemented according to the corporate standards for design and operations.
