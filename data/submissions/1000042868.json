The purpose of this Plan is to help prevent or minimize risk of exposure to chlorine gas for both employees of the Facility and also the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n1. FACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe ALASD Wastewater Treatment Plant treats an average of 2.58 million gallons of wastewater per day. The Facility uses approximately 120 pounds per day of chlorine for disinfection. During normal operations, the Facility may have up to 6,000 pounds of chlorine stored at the site. The chlorine is stored in 2,000 pound containers.\n\n\n\nThe Facility is required to create a Risk Management Plan for chlorine in compliance with Environmental Protection Agency Regulation 40 CFR 68. Creation of the RMP also provides compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) requirement in OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. A Facility follows this regulation when it houses more than a threshold quantity of a regulated material for use in a wastewater treatment process. The ALASD Plant maintains more than the threshold quantity, 2,500 pounds, of chlorine on-site at any given time. An original RMP was created and submitted to the EPA in June of 1999.  This version represents the latest of the required five-year updates.\n\n\n\n2. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\n\nThe ALASD Wastewater Treatment Facility has been operating for over 30 years with an excellent record for handling and feeding chlorine.\n\n\n\nThe feed system operates on a vacuum principle with automatic shut-off if the vacuum is interrupted.  This minimizes the risk of a major release as a result of damage to the chlorine piping system.  The facility is also equipped with an emergency back-up generator capable of running the chlorine system in the event of a power outage. The facility is equipped with a dry media chlorine gas scrubber c"

EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe ALASD facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  In the event of a chlorine release, an employee of the facility would be responsible for calling the Alexandria Fire Department and the Morris HAZMAT team.  These agencies are trained in handling emergency situations and dealing with hazardous materials.  They would be responsible for mitigating the effects of the release and coordinating evacuation procedures if necessary.\n\n\n\nA training program has been established to insure all employees of the wastewater treatment plant can identify an emergency situation and will understand the procedure necessary for notifying the proper authorities.  As part of this program, facility employees will also meet with representatives of the fire department to review the plant and emergency procedures.\n\n\n\n4. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RMP/PSM PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Facility has implemented written procedures in compliance with the RMP/PSM regulations to help minimize the risk of a chlorine release. The revised RMP/PSM Manual outlines training requirements, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, and defines responsible persons for implementing the aspects of the Plan. The RMP/PSM Plan will continue to provide guidance for the Facility's day-to-day operation, thereby creating a safer and more effective work environment.\n\n\n\nBruce Nelson (ALASD Executive Director) shall be the RMProgram Manager with overall responsibility for implementation of the Risk Management Program. This Program Manager shall be responsible for delegating responsibility for specific elements and also ensuring that the entire RMP is being implemented."
