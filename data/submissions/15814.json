An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Palatka and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred.  The alternative release scenarios will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distances. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Palatka Operations.
