The 3-inch diameter transfer line downstream of the storage tank pump fails releasing 314 gallons per minute of chlorine dioxide solution. This release rate is based on the rated capacity of a single pump (214 gallons per minute) plus 100 gallons per minute to account for the additional solution that would be released through the pump that is not operating as a result of the liquid head in the two storage tanks. The operations personnel are assumed to detect and isolate the release within 5 minutes. The released chlorine dioxide solution is assumed to spread as an uncontained spill.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nJEFFERSON SMURFIT CORPORATION (U.S.)\nBREWTON, ALABAMA MILL\n\n\nBrewton Mill Policy\n\nIt is the policy of Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (U.S.), Brewton, Alabama mill to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine or chlorine dioxide is minimized and if there is a release the offsite consequence will be reduced. To accomplish this the chlorine valves, regulators, heaters, vaporizers, controllers, lines, connections, fittings, injectors and the chlorine dioxide generator, storage tanks, pipe lines, mixers and pumps are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices. Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine and the chlorine dioxide systems have been trained in the requirements of chlorine and chlorine dioxide safety.\n\nDescription of Brewton Mill Operation\n\nJefferson Smurfit Corporation's Brewton facility produces a solid bleached sulfate paper and mottled white linerboard. In the process of bleaching pulp both chlorine and chlorine dioxide are utilized. Process water is treated with chlorine as part of our normal water treatment process.  \n\nDescription of RMP processes\n\nChlorine - Bleach plant \n\nChlorine is delivered to the mill in 90 tons rail cars that are used as the on-site storage container. The employees of the Bleach/Wash area connect the rail car to the mill unloading lines. This unloading process is continuous until the rail car is empty.  From the rail car, the liquid chlorine is transferred to a chlorine header where the Bleach plant uses the amount they need for their particular process. When the liquid chlorine leaves the header, it flows into a vaporizer and is turned into chlorine gas. The chlorine gas flows through a pressure-regulating valve where the pressure is controlled to 85 psig. From the pressure-regulating valve the chlorine flows through a flow-control valve, through a barometric loop and into the chlorine mixer and is absorbed by the brown stock used for paperm"

      "SummaryText": "aking. \n\nChlorine - Water treatment\n\nThe water treatment system receives their chlorine from the chlorine header described above under (Chlorine- Bleach Plant). When the liquid chlorine leaves the header, it flows into a vaporizer and is turned into chlorine gas and then into the chlorinator. The chlorinator injects chlorine gas into untreated mill water as long as mill water flow is maintained. Remotely operated isolation valves are provided in the liquid and vapor chlorine lines to and from this vaporizer. \n\nChlorine Dioxide\n\nChlorine dioxide is generated by combining R-2 solution (a mixture of sodium chlorate and sodium chloride) and sulfuric acid in an air-agitated reaction vessel called a generator. The gaseous chlorine dioxide is vented into two absorbers where it is absorbed in chilled water to create the liquid chlorine dioxide solution that is used to bleach the paper stock. The liquid chlorine dioxide is pumped to mixers or to stock pumps where it is blended into the stock. The stock is then pumped into towers to provide the necessary residence time required for the bleaching to occur. \n\nVapors that off-gas from the chlorine dioxide absorbers, storage tanks, standpipe, and stock towers are collected and sent to scrubbers to prevent their release to the atmosphere. The scrubbers use caustic solutions to scrub the vapors.\n\nWorst-case release scenario\t\n\nChlorine - Bleach plant / Water treatment\n\nThe worst-case scenario chosen is the catastrophic failure of a 90-ton chlorine railcar. A 90-ton chlorine railcar catastrophically fails releasing 180,000 pounds of pressurized liquefied chlorine over a 10-minute period. The resulting vapor cloud will be released as a dense gas. The RMP COMP model predicts that the resulting vapor cloud disperses downwind to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L approximately 14 miles from the point of release.\n\n\nAlternative release scenario\n\nChlorine dioxide \n\nThe alternate release scenario chosen is the failure of the 3-inch diameter"
