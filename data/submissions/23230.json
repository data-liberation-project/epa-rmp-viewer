This commitment is demonstrated by the investment of significant resources in accident prevention, such as personnel training, mechanical inspection, process control systems and by recognition of safety as a primary factor in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes since acquiring the Sea Robin Gas Plant in April 2000. However, if an accidental release does occur, trained plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nTo prevent accidental releases, the Sea Robin Gas Plant achieves control of hazardous materials by:\n\u00b7 A commitment to OSHA's PSM and HAZWOPER standards, EPA's RMP, DOT's Pipeline Safety and state and local regulations which promote and require adherence to process safety activities designed to prevent accidental releases.\n\u00b7 Development and use of Amerada Hess Corporation and Sea Robin Plant safety, operating, maintenance, emergency response, engineering design and construction policies, procedures and practices designed to prevent accidents and potential releases.\n\u00b7 Knowledge of and adherence to applicable industry recognized standards, specifications and recommended practices that address and provide guidance for the proper design, construction and operation of facilities containing hazardous materials.\n\u00b7 A comprehensive equipment inspection and testing program."

      "SummaryText": "Amerada Hess Corporation\nUnited States Onshore Production\nSea Robin Gas Plant\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency - Risk Management Program\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCERTIFICATION LETTER\n\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for the following process is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor. The Sea Robin Gas Plant identified potential candidates for worst-case scenarios and utilized the services of the Wilfred Baker Engineering Company of San Antonio, Texas to perform consequence analyses using the commercially available DNV Technica PHAST dispersion program and the Baker-Strehlow methodology for RMP radius of exposure for a 1-psi overpressure. According to the analyses, the maximum end point for a 1-psi vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is 111 feet (.021 miles) from the center of the explosion resulting from the instantaneous release of the inventory contained in the Product Surge Tank/Accumulator. The maximum distance beyond the plant property boundary is 21 feet. Within the past five years, the process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)). No additional measures beyond those stated in the Planned Changes to Improve Safety section of the Executive Summary are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process, entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.\n."

      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Plant is located at 5627 Aristide Road near Henry, Louisiana. The plant is across the street from the Henry Complex operated by Bridgeline Gas Distribution LLC, a subsidiary of Texaco Exploration and Production. The plant contains regulated flammables such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL). The main components being Normal Propane and Normal Butane within its process areas.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nProcesses at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. The Sea Robin Gas Plant adheres to all applicable federal and state regulatory statutes. \n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWithin the past five years, the Sea Robin Gas Plant has had no accidental release that caused off site impacts as defined by the Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).  Within the past 5 years the plant has not experienced an incident involving regulated flammables that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is designed to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is involved.  The procedure addresses emergency response, proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing and instructions in the use of emergency response equipment. Employees"

The maximum distance beyond the plant property boundary is 21feet, which enters into an open field owned by Equillon Pipeline Company.\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Sea Robin Gas Plant conducts ongoing efforts to reduce risk through the Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management. These include recommendations from process hazards analyses, employee suggestions, and recommendations from incident investigations, recommendations from compliance audits and review of the preventative maintenance and mechanical integrity program information."
