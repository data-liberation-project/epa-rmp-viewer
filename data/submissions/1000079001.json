      "SummaryText": "1.0  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n1.1  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nFreeport McMoRan is the owner and operator of the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant.  It is the policy of Freeport McMoRan that its employees, environment, property, and the general public be protected from any off-site impacts that may occur as a result of its operations.  To achieve this end, Freeport McMoRan strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations. Freeport McMoRan has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety at the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention (e.g., personnel training, safety consideration in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility, etc.).  The company's philosophy is to implement reasonable mitigation measures to eliminate preventable releases of regulated substances as well as non-regulated substances. \r\n  \r\nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant activates its emergency response policies to comply with the overall Freeport McMoRan policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environment are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\r\n\r\n1.2  Facility Description\r\n\r\nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is located approximately 12 miles inland from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 1.5 miles northeast of the Vandenberg Village.  The nearest public road is Harris Grade Road, approximately 0.25 miles to the west.  The facility is relatively remote and bounded by undeveloped private prope"

      "SummaryText": "rty.  The facility is fenced in and access is controlled by a locked gate that is manned 24-hours a day.  \r\n\r\nThe Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is a relatively small industrial operation, occupying approximately 20 acres and consists of one Program 3 process. The Gas Plant qualifies for Program 3 because it is subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health  Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (8 CCR 5189).\r\n\r\nThe facility receives incoming crude oil and gas from an offshore platform (including some gas from onshore fields) and then utilizes several operations to produce natural gas and natural gas liquids for product.  The incoming oil is processed in the oil treating portion of the facility where water and other contaminates are separated from the crude oil before it is shipped via pipeline to a refinery for further processing.  The incoming gas is treated by removing water, hydrogen sulfide, and other heavy hydrocarbon components.  The hydrocarbon liquids which are separated out are sent to pressure vessels for storage before being trucked offsite to distributors.  The dry natural gas from the process is sold as a product.  \r\n\r\n1.3  Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nRegulated flammable mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane and iso-pentane are present at the facility.  There are no regulated toxic substances present at the facility in excess of the federal threshold quantities.\r\n\r\n1.4  Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release for flammables, as defined in regulation, is a release of flammable materials resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory of the largest vessel. Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is often less than the maximum capacity, and this equipment is protected by high level alarms/shutdowns, pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be"

The Lompoc oil and Gas Plant has a total of three 30,000 gallon vessels located in the southeast corner of the facility, two butane/propane storage vessels as stated above and one vessel containing natural gas liquids. Per 40CFR68.25(b)(1), the greatest amount held in a single vessel shall be used to determine the worst-case release quantity. The worst-case release scenario did not identify and off-site impacts and no impact to public, environmental and residential receptors. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for flammables is a release of a flammable mixture which results in a vapor cloud fire. The alternative release scenario identified no off-site impact. \r\n\r\n1.5  Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program \r\n\r\nIn addition to being subject to RMP requirements the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant is subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions) Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \r\n\r\nCompliance with PSM's comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes which handle flammable materials.  The objective of the company's PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, Freeport McMoRan has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective process safety management program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process. Using this approach the following components were consider"

The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level.

These emergency response procedures address releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of fires or explosions.  The procedures address the following issues:  1) various aspects of proper emergency first-aid and medical treatment for exposures; 2) notification of local emergency response agencies; 3) evacuation plans for the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant and methods of accounting for facility personnel after an evacuation; and 4) post-incident cleanup/decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant follows procedures that address the maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment and alarms. \r\n\r\nApplication of the emergency response procedures ensures compliance with the Cal-OSHA Standard 8 CCR 3220 (Emergency Action Plans), and the emergency response element of PSM.  The basic concepts of these emergency procedures are to provide a comprehensive approach for managing emergencies.  The four elements of this approach are prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.\r\n\r\n1.9 Planned Changes to Improve Safety (On-going)\r\n\r\nAs a requirement of Santa Barbara County, Freeport McMoRan has performed a Best Available and Safest Technology (BAST) audit of the Lompoc Oil and Gas Plant.

The results of the audit indicate that the facility is in compliance with the letter and spirit"
