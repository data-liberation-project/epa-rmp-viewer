      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery, located in Salt Lake City, Utah, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, which includes:\n\n- Hydrogen\n- Methane\n- Ethane\n- Ethylene\n- Propane\n- Propylene\n- Butane\n- Butene\n- Isobutane\n- Isobutene\n- 2-butene-cis\n- 2-butene-trans\n- 2-Methylpropene\n- Pentane\n- Isopentane\n\n\nThe only regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is hydrogen fluoride.  \n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substances in a Program 3 process at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a LPG sphere containing butane.  Based on EPA's Offsite Consequence Guidance document, this scenario results in the 1.0 psi blast overpressure going off-site.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated toxic substances in a Program 3 process is a release of hydrogen fluoride from a storage tank in the Alkylation Unit.

      "SummaryText": ", this scenario results in the endpoint of 20 ppm of hydrogen fluoride going off-site.  No credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of a flammable mixture from a vessel in the Isomerization unit and results in off-site impacts.  However, no residences would be reached by the 1.0 psi overpressure.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for toxic substances at the refinery is a release of hydrogen fluoride in the Alkylation unit.  The scenario assumes a 1/4\" hole in the piping from the hydrogen fluoride storage tank and last for 10 minutes until the emergency block valves are closed.  Even though the refinery has a water spray safety system for hydrogen fluoride releases, this ARS does not take into account the impact of the safety system.  However, activation of the water spray system will significantly reduce the distance that the hydrogen fluoride travels.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. There have not been any incidences with a regulated material that resulted in any on-site or off-site impacts. We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Salt Lake refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Chevron Salt Lake refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\nOperating Procedures\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chevron Salt Lake refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Chevron Salt Lake refinery evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n \n4. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n \n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup power, backup pumps)\n \n6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n7. Automatic Interlocking System\n\n8. RATS ( Rapid Acid Transfer System)\n\n9. Surveilance camers monitored by plant operators\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire extinguishing system\n \n2. Trained emergency response personnel\n \n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing \napparatus)\n\n4. Water spray systems to mitigate a hydrogen fluoride release.\n \n\n\n \n \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.

      "SummaryText": "he Chevron Salt Lake refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Chevron Salt Lake refinery is coordinated with the South Davis Fire District and the Salt Lake City Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) within Davis and Salt Lake Counties. This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committees, which includes local government officials, and industry representatives. The Chevron Salt Lake refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with Davis County Sherriff\u0012s offices and emergency response organizations (e.g., local mutual aid organizations). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Chevron Salt Lake refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the \\\nrefinery. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake refinery resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned:\n\n1. Upgraded Alarm Systems\n2. Fire Water Mitigations Systems\n3. Upgraded Honeywell Controls\n4. Interlock Systems"
