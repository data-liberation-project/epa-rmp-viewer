      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Maumee Complex RMP Executive Summary\n\nSource and Product Description\nThe Andersons Maumee Wholesale Fertilizer facility is engaged in the handling, storage, shipping and receiving of bulk agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular) and miscellaneous farm supplies.  The Liquid Poly Phosphate Processing facility began operations in the fall of 1994.  Key personnel at the Maumee facility are Ed Norris, facility manager and Joe Schweitzer, operations manager.\n\nThe facility manufacturers a liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer called 10-34-0 (N-P-K analysis) which is produced by combining anhydrous ammonia, phosphoric acid and water, in a controlled environment.  While the process is exothermic, the resulting heat is managed through a closed-loop process that virtually eliminates the production of a steam plume.  Production rates average 18,000 tons of 10-34-0 fertilizer per year.\n\nThe Liquid Plant occupies approximately 2.5 acres and is situated on the west side of The Andersons Complex and northeast of the intersection of Ford Street and Illinois Ave.  There are two businesses directly to the north, Williams Brothers Concrete and Stoneco.  Charlie's Dodge Dealership is located to the west, on the other side of Ford St.  The Andersons General Store is southeast of the plant, across Illinois Ave.  \n\nThe only RMP material is anhydrous ammonia at the Wholesale Fertilizer facility.  A 30,000 gallon tank is used for bulk storage of  the material. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold 25,500 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tanks.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard.  Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative toxic effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes in contact with mucous membranes, in particular.  Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flamm"

The most probable time for an exposure or release to occur will be during a transfer from a delivery unit (a tanker truck or rail car) to the bulk storage tank.  Flexible hoses must be connected properly.  Hoses are date-stamped and replaced by the transporter or The Andersons in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are observed by Anderson personnel.\n\nTransfers of anhydrous from the bulk storage tank to the processing system occur inside fixed steel pipes and are automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.  Mass meters are used to indicate the rate of flow.\n\nWith elevated temperatures that occur during mid-to-late summer, the ammonia gas inside the bulk storage tank can expand, and possibly cause the relief valve to open in order to equalize the pressure inside the tank.  The relief valve will reseal itself when pressure is relieved.  These events are very short in duration - a few seconds at the most.  \n\nA complete failure or burst tank is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank for anhydrous ammonia was built under strict guidelines established in the ASME pressure vessel code. The National Board Certificates for the tank is on file.   The storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tank or appendages are performed by certified welders and stamped accordingly.  \n\n\nConsequences of Failure to Control the Hazards for Anhydrous Ammonia\nThe worst case scenario for this material was created using EPA's RMP Comp software.  A complete release of the tank contents (120,000 pounds -- creating a gas / vapor cloud) in a 10 minute period, using worst case atmospheric conditions, results in a distance to endpoint of  3.60 miles.  The estimated maximum exposed population is 25,000 people.  This distance would affect the f"

It is our belief that the risk of a complete release of the tank contents is infinitesimally small.  Active mitigation systems in place at this facility were designed to prevent or mitigate any attempts to empty the tank.  The tank is in a protected location, and all transfer appendages are protected by concrete barriers.\n\nA more probable release situation is expressed by the alternative release scenario.  We believe that a more likely release could occur from a tanker truck or railcar transfer hose failure.  Prior to the excess flow valve being activated, we estimate that the maximum amount of ammonia that could escape to the atmosphere is 12,000 pounds. A release of this nature would likely last for about ten minutes.  Utilizing an average wind speed of 4.0 m/sec and atmospheric stability class D,  the resulting distance to endpoint would be 0.20 miles.   In this more realistic scenario, the only potential exposed receptors would be The Andersons Maumee Complex, Stoneco, Williams Brothers Concrete and Charlies Dodge Dealership.  \n\nActive mitigation systems were included in the alternative case scenario.

Passive mitigation systems in place at the Maumee facility are:\n\u00b7 Secondary containment dikes that meet or exceed regulatory standards.\n\u00b7 Bulkhead breakaway units located on the connection points to the storage tanks. If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank(s), the concrete structure would cause the hose to break at the outside of the connection point.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just to the inside of the breakaway would prevent the tank from emptying to the atmosphere.\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  Active mitigation systems in place at the Maumee facility are:\n\u00b7 Excess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on both storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\u00b7 Back check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia or propane from flowing to a transport tank from the storage tank.\n\u00b7 Pressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or overfilling.  They open directly to the atmosphere at 250 psig and"

This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n\u00b7 An ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and a water hydrant to help knock down a vapor cloud.\n\u00b7 Spill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n\u00b7 Operator and truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\nPrevention Program\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.  All hoses, tanks, valves and storage units are inspected at least monthly, and usually daily during the production season.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of anhydrous ammonia.  All hose replacements are documented in the maintenance files.  Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\nThis facility uses Paul Akars, Inc., an Indianapolis, Indiana firm, for all welding and construction performed on the anhydrous ammonia tank or transfer pipes.  The last complete inspection of the tank and piping was the fall of 1997.  A full-scale anhydrous ammonia audit was also performed at this time.  Copies of all reports are on file. The Maumee processing plant undergoes a complete ammonia inspection by a third party at least every four years.\n\nSee Steps Taken to Address Hazards for more information on prevention measures and identification.\n\n\nManagement System\n(see Steps Taken to Address Hazards)\n\n\nEquipment maintenance\nAll equipment maintenance is formally documented.
