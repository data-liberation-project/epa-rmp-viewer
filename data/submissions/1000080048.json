      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - OMEGA GAS PLANT \n\n\n\nMarkWest Oklahoma, L.L.C. (MarkWest), owner and operator of the Omega Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\n\n\nThe Omega Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system. Produced natural gas is brought into the plant via the inlet slug catchers which separates condensate and free water from the natural gas stream. The gas stream is then compressed, carbon dioxide is removed, and it is dehydrated to remove any water. The gas then enters a cryogenic process where ethane and heavier natural gas liquids (NGLs) are separated from the methane gas stream. The methane is then sent to a sales pipeline and the NGLs, also known as Y-grade, are pumped into a product pipeline for sales. \n\n\n\nThe products at the Omega Gas Plant contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include the same methane through pentane components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the\n\nrequirements set forth in the Risk Management Program (RMP) rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e) for flammable worst-case release scenario. The worst-case radius to endpoint was determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the Environmental Protectio"

The population within the worst-case radius was determined using the Missouri Census Data Center.\n\n\n\nSeveral vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios.  Results of the worst-case release scenarios indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 1 requirements.  Details of the worst-case release scenario are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP Plan.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe Omega Gas Plant is covered by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program to aid in accident release prevention.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\n\n\nIn the last five years, the Omega Gas Plant has had no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION \n\n\n\nThe Omega Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).  The facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of company staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs.  However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the Omega Gas Plant would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical process operations befor"

The Omega Gas Plant has around the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, LEPC, and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Omega Gas Plant is coordinated with the Kingfischer County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Omega Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations. This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Omega Gas Plant will conduct periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility will provide annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n\n\nThe Region Manager has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP. Specific responsibilities are summarized in the supporting documentation associated with this RMP.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nThe Omega Gas Plant will resolve the findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. Currently, there are no findings to report.\n\n\n\nMarkWest believes that diligent compliance with our PSM Program forms the framework that allows for the continued improvement to the level of safety at the Omega Gas Plant.  Some of the key components of the program that will help maintain and, where applicable, improve safety are:\n\n\n\nThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the Om"
