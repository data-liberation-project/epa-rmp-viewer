The plant's raw materials are used to make high purity chemicals for the semiconductor industry. Manufactured chemicals include: hydrofluoric acid, blends from 1:1 to 19:1 sulfuric/hydrofluoric acid, ammonium hydroxide and ammonium fluoride.\n\n\n\nThe materials used by the facility, which are on the RMP Rules List of regulated substances, are hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous), ammonia (anhydrous)and 29% Ammonia Solution. Honeywell Bryan's storage and use of hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous), ammonia (anhydrous), and 29% Ammonia Solution exceeds the specified threshold[s] of 5,000 lbs, 10,000 lbs and 20,000 lbs respectively, as defined by the EPA's RMP Rule.  \n\n\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the RMP Rule, a description of the following six elements is provided for Honeywell Bryan: \n\n\n\n1.

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the Honeywell Bryan Plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below, together with chemical-specific prevention steps, as applicable.\n\n\n\n3a. Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for the manufacturing processes including Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia and 29% Ammonia Solution.  This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes.  The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of the regulated chemicals (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., Process Flow Diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates and storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of exceedances), and data on the equipment used in the process (e.g., Piping & Instrument Diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems, ventilation systems, and design basis including conformance to applicable codes and standards).  The process safety information shows compliance of the process design with generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n\n\n3b. Process Hazard Analyses\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analyses fo"

Personnel having experience and knowledge of the covered processes and knowledge of the program requirements conduct the compliance audits.  Records of the compliance audit reports are maintained to document the results of the audits and corrective actions taken, as appropriate. The site also has a triennial Corporate Audit conducted by personnel having experience and knowledge of the covered processes and knowledge of the program requirements. \n\n\n\n \n\n3i. Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nAll incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in, a release of Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia or 29% Ammonia Solution are investigated promptly.  The incident investigation starts with the completion of an Incident Investigation Report prepared by the supervisor on duty at the time of the incident, and is distributed to the incident investigation team.  The incident investigation team is made up of employees having experience and knowledge of the processes affected by the incident, and knowledge of completing incident investigations.  Following the incident investigation, a report is prepared to include the f"

Employee Participation\n\n\n\nAll employees at Honeywell Bryan have opportunities to access and participate in the sharing of information related to process safety for the processes involving Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride, Anhydrous Ammonia and 29% Ammonia Solution. Employees in the maintenance and operating areas attend monthly safety meetings to review incidents, learn about new or modified processes, and discuss specific safety awareness topics. Employees routinely have opportunities to participate in other safety processes under the prevention program such as process hazard analyses, management of change, employee training and incident investigations.\n\n\n\n3k. Hot Work Permits\n\n\n\nHoneywell Bryan has established a hot work permit system.  Under the system, a hot work permit must be issued prior to commencing hot work operations.  Hot work operations may include burning, welding, torch cutting, or any spark-emitting equipment/activity.  The hot work permit indicates the type and method of hot work to be conducted, the equipment the hot work will be performed on, the date, time, and location authorized for the hot work, the presence of fire prevention and protection systems meeting the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and signatures of the supervisory employees authorizing the hot work.  A separate hot work permit must be issued for ea"

Contractors\n\n\n\nPrior to retaining contractor services for work in the process area, the contractor's safety performance and program is evaluated.  This includes a 3-year review of the contractor's Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), review of OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses and corrective actions, review of Lost Work Day Cases Away (LWDCA) and corrective actions, review of the contractor's safety program including safety policies, training, and medical monitoring, and review of any applicable plant-specific health and safety plan prepared by the contractor.  \n\n\n\nPrior to commencing work at the plant, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation provided by Honeywell.  The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be used, overview of the plant emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of emergency, and a review of plant safety rules and applicable operating procedures.  A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the plant, including the date the training was completed.  Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible for ensuring that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation.  If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on plant.  Failure of the contractor or any contractor employee to abide by these requirements is grounds for immediat"

The Five-Year Accident History:  \n\nOn May28, 2016 a flange leak occurred on the V-200 AHF Storage Tank to V-201 HF Reactor transfer line.  This line contains 100% liquid anhydrous hydrofluoric acid (AHF).  The amount of the release was approximately 4,946 pounds.  This line is routed through a covered underground pipe trench that spans the length between the AHF Barn and the HF Production Building.  Because of the heavy rains that occurred at the Bryan plant on 5/26/2016 (100yr event), the pipe trench was full of water.  The pipe trench is nominally between 3'0\" and 3'4\" deep, 4' wide and 115' long.  The AHF transfer piping is on pipe supports but with the trench being full was approximately 2' submerged under the water.  The AHF release was almost wholly absorbed in the water that was in the trench with a small cloud formation at the end of the event that was absorbed with spray from a water cannon.  There was no offsite release, no injuries, and all wastewater from the spill was contained on site.\n\n\n\n5.    The Emergency Response Plan:\n\n\n\nAn Emergency Response/contingency Plan has been developed to provide a formal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property for both the employees and surrounding community in the event of an emergency such as: fire; explosion; release of highly hazardous chemicals (HHC); transportation emergency; criminal acts; and natural emergency.  This plan also formalizes the arrangements with local police, local neighbors, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response contractors, and all governing state and federal agencies in case of an emergency.  A copy of this plan is available to each employee and is intended to meet the mandates of the Occupational Safety & Health Act, 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), and all other applicable state, federal, and local governing authority requirements. \n\n\n\n6.
