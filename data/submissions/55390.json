Operators receive periodic refresher training.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe Peru Facility has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program. The program is comprised of trained personnel who are to follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures designed to ensure proper function of process equipment.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Peru Facility has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process. The procedures are designed such that, prior to any change, the following issues are to be considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements. Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are to be informed of and trained in the change. If necessary, the process safety information and operating procedures are to be updated.\n\nPRE-START UP REVIEW\nThe Peru Facility performs pre-startup safety reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The pre-startup safety review is designed to confirm, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construc"

Teams comprised of employees and/or consultants with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed. The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\nThe Peru Facility investigates incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals. The investigation is to be promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident. To perform the investigation, the Peru Facility has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, thefactors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation. The Peru Facility has established a system to promptly address and resolve the incident report findings and recommendations and to document their resolution. Finally, incident reports are to be reviewed with all affected personnel.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nThe Peru Facility has developed a written action plan for employee participation designed to cover all aspects of its process safety management program.

      "SummaryText": " the five-year accident history, but you are not required to do so.?\n\nThe incident being reported occurred on 9/9/08. The Facility experienced an electrical arc incident as a result of water leaking through a roof, that caused a considerable amount of damage to a motor control center (\"MCC room\") at the Facility. It is expected that a small amount of NO was released due to the arc event. The process is covered for pentane, but not for NO. In addition, the arc incident caused the loss of the Facility's flare for a period of approximately 77 hours, which resulted in a small amount of pentane being released to the atmosphere from the flare header. However, as discussed above, neither the release of pentane nor NO caused any property damage. Rather, the arc incident caused the damage which led to the release of small amounts of the chemicals noted. The amount of NO released is not known, but is assumed to be less than 1 lb, so the maximum of 1 lb was reported. The amount of pentane released was calculated from production data at 195 lbs.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program.\nThe Peru Facility has a written emergency response program that contains procedures to be followed in the case of an accidental release of a regulated substance. These procedures include steps for informing the public, proper first aid and medical treatment, the proper use of emergency equipment and emergency response training. The emergency response plan is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. Likewise, the emergency response equipment is maintained, tested, and inspected periodically. The Peru Facility is actively involved with informing local stakeholders about hazardous substances stored and\nprocessed at the facility. The Peru Facility participates with the City of Peru Fire Department, the City of LaSalle Fire Department, the LaSalle County LEPC and others in assisting local officials in the development of emergency procedures to identify resources, chemicals, contacts and material safety data"
