THE TANKS ARE DESIGNED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE  LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE FACILITY HAS ALSO PROVIDED STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).  THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTS OUR TANKS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE COMPLY WITH ALL OF THEIR REQUEST FOR IMPROVEMENTS.\n\nTHE COMPANY IS PLANNING TO INSTALL EMERGENCY SHUT OFF VALVES ON ALL PLANTS WHEN THE BUDGET ALLOWS US TO DO SO. \n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE A TOXIC GAS RELEASE OF 132,000 POUNDS OF AMMONIA.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD RELEASE 11,908 LBS OF AMMONIA THROUGH THE TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT HAS BEEN SHRED WITH THE LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT.\n\nTHIS COMPANY'S POLICY HAS BEEN TO TRAIN EMPLOYEES IN THE SAFE HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA ON A REGULAR BASIS.   THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN THE AMMONIA PLANT ARE TRAINED IN THE SAFETY INFORMATION, HAZARDS, OPERATING PROCEDURES AND THE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES OF THE TYPICAL FACILITY.  THE EMPLOYEES ALWAYS WEAR GOGGLES AND THE APPROPRIATE GLOVES WHILE FILLING NURSE TANKS.  ABOVE ALL, THEY MAKE SURE TO HAVE CLEAN SAFETY WATER ON HAND DURING  AMMONIA OPERATIONS.   OUR SAFETY RECORD  ALLOWS US TO PROUDLY REPORT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURY ACCIDENTS AT THIS PLANT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.\n\nOUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN IS SHARED WITH OUR THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THEY ARE AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  THEY'VE ALSO, AGREED TO ASSIST US IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY."
