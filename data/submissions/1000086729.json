The facility currently meets and exceeds all requirement of 40 CFR 68 under the Clean Air Act and will continue to comply with any and all federal, state, and county regulations.\r\n\r\n8.\tFlammables: Worst Case\r\n\r\nThe use of flammable materials at Purolite is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.

Purolite is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Purolite's staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and using 20% Oleum.\r\n\r\nPurolite has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the 20% Oleum system. Purolite's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nPurolite is located at 3620 G Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the county of Philadelphia. The primary activity at the Facility is the use of 20% Oleum to manufacture ion exchange resins. Purolite's manufacturing process utilizes sulfonators, reactors, and dryers. The 20% Oleum is stored in 10,000-gallon and 4,000-gallon vessels. The maximum quantity of 20% Oleum in both vessels that is handled in this process is 189,805 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.\tHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary and can be found in the Hazard Assessment report.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\n\r\nAlthough the storage and use of 20% Oleum has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Purolite has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are \r\nbeing performed.\r\n\r\nThe facility's maximum intended inventory of the 20% Oleum is 189,805 pounds. Therefore, the covered process has over the 10,000 pounds threshold quantity for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM. As a result, the 20% Oleum covered process is subject to EPA RMP Program Level 3 and OSHA PSM.\r\n\r\nThe 20% Oleum Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n\r\n-Process Safety Information\r\n-Process Hazard Analysis\r\n-Operating Procedures\r\n-Training\r\n-Mechanical Integrity\r\n-Management of Change\r\n-Pre-Startup Safety Review\r\n-Compliance Audits\r\n-Incident Investigation\r\n-Employee Participation\r\n-Hot Work Permit\r\n-Contractors\r\n\r\nIn addition, key emergency response elements were addressed in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program.
