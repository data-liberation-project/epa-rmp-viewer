      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nRandalls Houston Distribution Center, a Division of Safeway, Inc., has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for their 10700 Telge Road, Houston, Texas warehouse (Randalls Houston) to present the compliance elements of the US EPA?s Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe intent of the RMP is to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), a regulated substance, and to mitigate the severity of a potential release that may occur. A written copy of the RMP is available to Federal, State, and local government agencies and the public, upon request. The key elements of the RMP are presented below.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE \n\nThe Randalls Houston Distribution Center provides distribution service to the stores in Houston and Austin. Both perishable and dry grocery products are received and stored at the distribution center, where stores submit orders on a daily basis. Product is delivered to each store in less than 24 hours from the time of order. Initially occupied by Randalls in 1983, the facility has been expanded several times. The most recent expansion included a 90,000 square-foot freezer which was completed in June 1999. \n\nTo refrigerate the warehouse, the site has an ammonia refrigeration system that uses 12,000 pounds of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system is a ?closed-loop? system and consists of vessels, piping, valves, and other process equipment. All refrigeration vessels are located inside the warehouse buildings. \n\nThe refrigeration cycle consists of compressing and expanding ammonia and changing the physical state from high pressure liquid, to low pressure liquid, to low pressure vapor, to high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (e.g. lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature). Low-pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration. Typical"

      "SummaryText": " operating conditions range from approximately 0 psig on the low-pressure side to approximately 180 psig on the high pressure side. \n\nAmmonia is a very efficient refrigerant. It is the most environmentally friendly refrigerant in existence and does not contribute to global warming. It has been in use successfully as a refrigerant for more than 100 years. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRandalls has a long and distinguished record in operating an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration plant. Since 1983, there has not been one major (in excess of 100 pounds) release of ammonia. The staff who operate and maintain the plant are well trained and they follow recognized preventive maintenance procedures to ensure the system remains safe and effective. \n\nMany parts of the company are involved in the development and maintenance of safety guidelines including the following departments: risk management, loss prevention, safety, public relations, and distribution center personnel.\n\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system employed by Randalls Distribution Center is equipped with various automatic process controls intended to provide automated control of system operations. The automatic process controls consist of liquid level controls, pressure controls, and pressure relief valves.  Ammonia sensors are also employed throughout the plant including the machine room and evaporator areas.  There are 2 ammonia detectors in the engine room, 2 in Perishable Zone?s 3 and 4, and 1 in each of Perishable Zone 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11.  \n\nShould leaks occur, most are small enough that they do not go beyond the boundaries of the facility. Houston Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), the Harris County HazMat Response Team, the fire department, and police, will be notified to make sure all safety procedures are strictly followed. In the unlikely event of a major release of ammonia, the community will be notified by the above "

      "SummaryText": "sources. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBased on the Hazard Assessment Update (April 2004), which conducted a review of the accident history during the last five years (April 1999 through April 2004), the Randalls Houston Distribution Center has not had an accidental release or \"near miss\" of ammonia. \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Randalls Houston Distribution Center has prepared a Contingency Plan which outlines the reporting, notification, evacuation, and mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure proper response to and reporting of an emergency situation. The Contingency Plan procedures were designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe emergency response program includes coordination with local emergency response officials. Our risk management and public relations departments will work closely together to ensure that we take appropriate measures to inform the surrounding community should a release ever occur. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Randalls Houston Distribution Center has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit (November 2002) and revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (November 2003). Both studies resulted in minor procedural modifications to ensure a safe operation. These modifications are currently being implemented with an expected date of completion being December 1, 2004. The Facility Maintenance Manager, together with the Corporate Environmental Affairs Manager are responsible for ensuring that these recommendations are implemented. \n\nIn addition to the mitigation measures included in the Compliance Audit and Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation, the Process Safety Management team continues to ensure employee involvement in Safety Plan Development and training requirement protocol."
