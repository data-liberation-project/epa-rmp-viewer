Accordingly, Optech has developed proactive safety and environment programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Carlos A Morris WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  Optech has determined that the OSHA Process Safety Management standard also applies to the personnel at the Carlos A Morris WWTP and therefore has prepared this RMP to comply with the RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, Optech affirms its proactive and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no release would occur.  Accoordingly, a wel-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility release and minimize the consequence of a release should on occur.\n\nOptech takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the two facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well-informed requarding the hazards associated with re "

The employees that work on the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nOptech management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an affect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described system operating procedures.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Carlos A Morris WWTP is located at 54 Grover Street, in Pichard, Moble County, Alabama.  The Carlos A Morris WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations.  This acitvated sludge plant has anaerobic digester, drying beds, primary and secondary clarification.  Average design flow is 4.0 MGD, with peak capacity of 9.0 MGD.  Sludge is transported to a landfill site by a separate contractor.  Optech developed an equipment repair program and an ongoing training program.  The Carlos A Morris WWTP utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of wastewater.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of three containers ( 6,000 pounds ) on site.  In addition, the Carlos A Morris WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one- ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of four containers ( 8,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Carlos A Morris WWTP is requlated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide store and used at the facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Carlos A Morris WWTP RMP manual.

      "SummaryText": " RMP, there were no accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has established and maintains and emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the Moblie Fire Department.  The program is decribed in detail in the Carlos A Morris WWTP RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which included facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effect of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employes.  Employee meeting that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Carlos A Morris WWTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recongnize hazard and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Carlos A Morris WWTP program, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Through not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exeercise has provided all a affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues ralated to the covered process."
