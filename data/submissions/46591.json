L.L.C.\nRMP / Executive Summary\n\n A five year review of the Risk Management Program was completed 8/16/2006 by the PSM/RMP committee.\nThe safe operation of our anhydrous ammonia system is pryority to our management staff as well as operator / maintenance staff.\n\nCurrently our system is operating within the same peramitters and at the same operating levels as our initial RMP submission. Anhydrous Ammonia continues to be the only regulated substance requiring a PSM/RMP at our facility.\n\nSinton Dairy is a domestic producer of fluid milk and culture products. The site location is within the Colorado Springs City limits, located at 3801 N Sinton Rd. The site is approximately 8.5 acres and has about an  90,000 square foot facility. There are approximately 165 employees at the site, represented by Teamsters Local 537.\n\nAmmonia continues to be used as an refridgerant at the facility. The facility continues to operate at approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The OCA remains the same for our facility in light of the same usage levels and operating peramitters. We have therefore elected to use the same release scenario as required by the Off Site Consequence Analysis. The worst case scenario involed a primary High Pressure Liquid vessel known as the high side suction accumulator catastrophically failing resulting in a liquid ammonia release to atmosphere. Assuming no mitigation attempt, the contents of the vessel, 11,728 pounds of ammonia could be spilled onto the ground and evaporate in ten minutes forming a toxic vapor cloud, if wind allowed the ammonia cloud to travel off site the end point was deturmined to be 1.3 miles off site. This calculation was based on EPA recommended guidelines.\nThe second or alternative scenario that was selected was a hose failure during liquid charging. This scenario assumes an 1800 pound ammonia release within ten minutes could result in a vapor cloud extending 0.11 miles, or 581 feet from the facility.\n\nSi"

The maintenance staff is trained to quickely assess a potentially hazardous situation and initiate emergency response from the Colorado Springs Fire Department. Further, three HAZWOP trained on-scene incedent commanders are available to supply the fire department with their ammonia expertise.\n\nMechanical integrity and employee training continue to be key elements in the prevention program, maintaining the system through monthly system inspections insures a safe system, likewise, insuring a working knowledge by the operating staff is considered essential to the safe operation of the system.\n\nSinton Dary Foods Comp.
