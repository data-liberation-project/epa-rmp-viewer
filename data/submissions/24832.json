S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP Regulations, our worst case release scenario for flammables would be the loss of all of the propane in our largest vessel causing a vapor cloud explosion.  In the case of the Schaefferstown Facility, this would involve our 10,300,000 gallon cryogenic propane tank.  Such a scenario is highly unlikely, however, at an overpressure of 1 psi, which is EPA's threshold for measurable impacts from a vapor cloud explosion, public receptors would be affected if this event were to occur.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases (high level alarms, emergency shutdown and others) and to manage their consequences, no credit for any controls or mitigation measures was taken into account when evaluating this scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario, characterized as a more likely scenario that would involve offsite damage, is based on a power outage at the facility and release of propane vapor from the cryo tank relief valve.  The relief valve ensures that the entire tank does not rupture and only a controllable release results.  We have active mitigation measures in place to greatly reduce the chance that such an event could ever occur.  Most important of these is a flare system which would burn off the propane vapor.  Only when the capacity of the flare is exceeded would there be a release of vapor to the atmosphere.  The presence of active mitigation measures serves to either prevent this scenario from occurring or minimize its impact if it does occur. .  We have discussed these potential propane releases with our employees and with loca"

Our management philosophy goals are achieved by the personal commitments of our employees and contractors, and by open communication with our employees, customers, neighbors, and with regulators. The accidental release prevention and emergency response programs we have at our facilities are part of the high standards we strive for at Koch Hydrocarbon.  Our high standards are achieved by operating in compliance with all required environmental permits and regulations, by operating and maintaining our assets in such a manner that any unpermitted release will be unintentional and acknowledged as unacceptable, by remedying any shortcomings found during regular audits of our facilities, and by reporting promptly to regulators any shortcomings found during the course of our audits as required by law.\n\nThe Schaefferstown Facility is one of many facilities operated by Koch Hydrocarbon.  Propane and Ethyl Mercaptan are the only flammable substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are present at the Schaefferstown Facility.  There are no toxic substances present at the site.  The facility is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.  At the facility, we receive propane via pipeline and tanker trucks.  The received propane is dehydrated and stored in pressure vessels.  From these pressure vessels, propane can be loaded directly into tanker trucks for distribution or sent to cryogenic storage tanks for storage.  For cryogenic storage, propane is cooled in a refrigeration system and sent to two cryogenic tanks for storage at -44o F and less than 14 inches of water column.  The purpose of this Risk Man"

Our ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have helped us avoid any serious accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the additional prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00b7We provided emergency shutdown devices at thirteen locations throughout the facility in order to shutdown the entire facility during emergency situations.\n\u00b7We provided high and high high level alarms on all our storage tanks and bullets in order to prevent overfilling.\n\u00b7We installed a fire water system at the facility which is designed to cool the tanks in the event of a fire.\n\u00b7We installed a hydrocarbon gas detection system consisting of 48 gas detectors located throughout the facility.  The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm at low gas concentrations and will trigger emergency shutdown system at high gas concentrations.\n\u00b7We installed a fire detection system consisting of six fire-eyes which will trigger emergency shutdown system when activated.\n\u00b7We provided reverse check valves on hot bullets to prevent overfill and excess flow valves to stop flow in the event of a pipeline rupture or break.\nWe provided an emergency generator at the facility in order to operate the process control system and the fire protection system even during power failure.\n\nThese safeguards as well as the vigilance of our trained employees have helped us operate safely at this facility since we acquired it in 1992.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo inc"

Although we take pride in that record, we also place daily emphasis on our prevention and safety programs to ensure this record continues.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAny emergency response necessary for the Schaefferstown Facility is coordinated with the Schaefferstown Fire Department, the Lebanon County Police Department, the Lebanon County Emergency Management Agency, and the Lebanon County Emergency Medical Services and as appropriate with the Pennsylvania State Highway Patrol, the Texas Eastern Pipeline, and Buckeye Pipeline.  The Schaefferstown Facility Manager is responsible for coordinating all emergency actions.
