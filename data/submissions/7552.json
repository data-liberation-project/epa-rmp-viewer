A guiding principle, as stated in our Yerkes Vision Statement, is We will perform our jobs in a manner that ensures the safety and health of ourselves and our fellow employees and protects the site facilities and the environment of our community.\n\nThe DuPont Yerkes Plant adheres to Corporate policies.  These policies are embodied in numerous Safety Health & Environmental and Engineering Standards, which apply globally.  These standards can be summarized as follows:\n\n7 All Safety and Environmental incidents are preventable.\n7 The Goal is Zero - Zero Incidents, Period.\n7 All employees and contractors are responsible for their safety.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND SUBSTANCE REGULATED BY RMP REGULATION\n\nThe Yerkes plant covers approximately 100 acres in a highly industrialized section of the Town of Tonawanda, NY.

Currently, the site consists of two manufacturing processes:\n\n7 Tedlar. polyvinyl fluoride films\n7 Corian. sheet and shape filled acrylic building materials\n\nThe EPA has identified VINYL FLUORIDE (VF), which is flammable, as the only chemical at Yerkes which has the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\n\n WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE-CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Vinyl Fluoride, Regulated Flammable Chemical\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is a failure of one of our two independent and identical Vinyl Fluoride storage tanks, with no mitigation assumed.  This release, if ignited, would result in a vapor cloud explosion that would have an off-site impact as determined by the use of the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  In the event of a release there should be no public receptors.  A release is unlikely due to the construction and high-integrity design of the tanks / associated equipment, and the dual water deluge / emergency tower venting systems.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Vinyl Fluoride, Regulated Flammable Chemical\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario is a failure of a flex hose during unloading of Vinyl Fluoride from a tank truck to a storage tank, with no mitigation assumed.  This alternative-case scenario was selected because of the frequency of truck unloading.  The release rate is based on the maximum flow than can occur before the excess flow valve self actuates.  The duration of the release is based on a conservative estimate of the time needed to shu"

This release, if ignited, would result in a flash fire that would have an off-site impact as determined by the use of the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  In the event of a release there should be no public receptors.  A release and subsequent flash fire is unlikely because of the tank truck excess flow valve, automatic shutdown equipment and procedures, and the construction and high-integrity design of tank trucks and associated unloading / transfer equipment.  Also, preventive maintenance of the hoses and used of checklists reduces the possibility of a unloading hose failure.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY FOR ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF RMP CHEMICALS\n\nWithin the past five years, the Tedlar. process has had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the Risk Management Plan regulation, (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\nRecords are kept for all Serious Incidents (non-standard operations) that occur at our facility.  For every Serious Incident, we conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the event.  Although there have been Serious Incidents, none have resulted in a RMP incident in the 37 years of Tedlar. operations.   \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND VINYL FLUORIDE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nYerkes accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of Vinyl Fluoride.  The site takes a systematic, proactive approach to prevent accidental releases of Vinyl Fluoride.  The process to react Vinyl Fluoride to form polyvinyl fluoride follows the requirements of the DuPont Corporate Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This standard includes and embraces the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.
