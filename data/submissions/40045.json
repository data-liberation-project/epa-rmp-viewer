To assist with ongoing compliance, a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" along with a \"Operations and Maintenance Manual\" have been prepared and implemented.  Concerning the emergency response policy at the facility, the owner has made the decision that employees will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances and will instead evacuate.\n\nThis facility is a water treatment plant.  Treatment includes chlorination of the water with two chlorine cylinders located at the facility (2,000 lbs each).   The rate of chlorine injected into the water is automatically regulated and varies based on the current needs.  Once the chlorine is injected into the water, it is diluted to an amount which is less than 1% chlorine by weight.  The storage cylinders and mixing equipment are subject to the \"Risk Management Plan\" requirements since it contains threshold quantities of regulated substances.\n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a documented prevention program is required.  This program is discussed in a \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" along with a \"Operations and Maintenance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  The prevention program does discuss chlorine which is  the specific chemical contained in an amount above the threshold quantity.   \n\nAs documented in Section 4.0 of the \"Risk Management Plan,\" the facility has not experienced a release as defined in the regulation within the past five years.  \n\nSince this facility is a Program 2, a written emergency response program is required.  This program is contained in Section 5.0 of the \"Chemical Accident Prevention Compliance Manual\" prepared for the facility.  Further, emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the \"Risk Management Plan\" and these procedures will "
