Miles Norfolk, Virginia refrigeration system.  The Risk Management Program and RMP meet and address the requirements of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 68.\nThis Executive Summary briefly describes the following elements:\n?    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n?    The stationary source and regulated substances handled; \n?    The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario; \n?    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps; \n?    The five-year accident history; \n?    The emergency response program; and\n?    Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, J.H. Miles is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs.  As a demonstration of J.H. Miles?s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, they are taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the J.H. Mile Norfolk, Virginia facility refrigeration system.  The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop industrial refrigeration system.  The ammonia is not used or mixed in any manner with other chemical processes.\n\nA \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed id"

      "SummaryText": "entifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm.  Emergency response is discussed in Section 5 of this RMP.  J.H. Miles has a detailed Emergency Action Plan (ERP) for their facility.  The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n \nTo address the five year accident history is not an issue, since the facility for the past 5 years has no history of reportable ammonia releases.  To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, J.H. Miles is implementing a detailed Risk Management program (Preventative Program 2) developed for their facility in Norfolk, Virginia.  The Preventative Program 2 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process.  Program 2 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so that the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.\n\nJ.H. Miles? planned changes to improve safety include being proactive in addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, incident investigations , program audits, and other safety issues that may arise.  The flexibility of the program allows J.H. Miles to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing J.H. Miles employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia."
