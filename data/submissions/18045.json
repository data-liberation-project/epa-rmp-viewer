      "SummaryText": "(a) Who - Winneshiek Cooperative Association (WCA) is an organization owned by crop growers and livestock producers in NE Iowa and SE Minnesota. The member-owners of WCA benefit from having strategically located fertilizer, feed and grain facilities in Winneshiek and Howard (Iowa) counties.\n\nBeing owned by farmers, WCA does everything it can to protect and preserve the environment.  The members, management and employees of WCA are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of any kind, including liquefied petroleum gas (LP) from the tanks for the corn dryer at our Florenceville, Iowa location.  In the event an accidental release occurs, the Florenceville facility is well prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nAll applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prevention programs are strictly adhered to. The WCA Emergency Response Policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response capabilities of the community they're located in.\n\n(b) What and Where - The Florenceville branch of WCA has LP Gas as one of the most economical sources of fuel to run the co-op's corn dryers. The Florenceville location serves corn growers from NE Iowa and SE Minnesota. The Florenceville branch includes the LP grain dryers, grain storage and a bagged feed, seed and crop protection product warehouse. The LP GAS is stored in a four 1,000 gallon tanks. These tanks, with a maximum capacity of 17,500 pounds of LP, are mounted on two cement pillars. The entire LP GAS handling process includes the latest safety products, with many of the safe-guards duplicated to assure extra protection. The facility is inspected on a daily basis during the fall harvest seasons. All of the LP GAS equipment is inspected annually by State officials. Much of the non-durable equipment (including ho"

The Florenceville branch is manned, with staff on site five days a week.\n\n (c) Worst-case and alternate accidental release scenarios - The offsite consequence analysis includes two accidental release theories, found as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative release scenario.\" \n\nThe worst case scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel . . . is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.   This accidental release is very unlikely to occur.  However, should it occur, 17,500 pounds of LP GAS would be released, with an estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure of 0.2 miles down wind from the facility.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur\" than the worst-case scenario.  With no accident history experience to base on, it is WCA's presumption the most likely to occur would be the rupture of a transfer hose or pipe, tied with the failure of the involved excess-flow valve. However, should it occur, 17,500 pounds of LP GAS would be released, with an estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure of 0.1 miles down wind from the facility.\n\n\nWCA used RMP-Comp to calculate the \"distance to 1 psi overpressure endpoint\" selected by the EPA. The population within the \"endpoint distance\" of the Florenceville facility is defined as the \"population potentially affected\" by a worst-case flammable release.\n\nBecause LP GAS is not stored within a building, no passive mitigation measures can be credited to slow or reduce any release.\n\n\n\n (d) How to prevent accidental releases - WCA's accidental release prevention program is based upon provisions within  \"NFPA 58.\"  In addition to these requirements, WCA has also included the following elements:\n\n1. Strictly limiting the number of staff who are allowed to handl"

WCA has an extensive emergency response program, which it coordinates with the Howard County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local fire departments. This program includes an emergency response decision chart, emergency phone number list, notification plans, maps and diagrams."
