This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes.  Crestwood's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Pale Horse Compressor Station current throughput is approximately 90 MMSCFD. The station consists of the following; inlet liquid/gas separation, filtration, inlet compression, TEG dehydration, J-T fuel gas treatment, atmospheric storage for condensate and produced water, truck loading, as well as all other associated utilities such as fuel gas and instrument air. The processes at the station are interconnected by piping and fit the EPA's definition of a stationary source in 40 CFR part 68. The facility contains two sources of a regulated substance held over its respective threshold quantity; Pentane and Flammable Mixture. \n\n\n\nChemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Pale Horse Compressor Station have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to the prevention of accidental releases of the regulated substance in the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Pale Horse Compressor Station has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n1.    Tanks are gauged\n\n2.    Tanks/vessels are equipped with level and pressure se"

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.

      "SummaryText": "op exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Pale Horse Compressor Station is coordinated with the Converse County LEPC. Russ Dalgarn is the contact for the Emergency Management Agency for Converse County and can be reached at (307) 359-3444.  The Pale Horse Compressor Station has around-the-clock communications capability. Crestwood operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset. The operator will then call the appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., Douglas Fire Department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. Crestwood conducts periodic emergency drills that involve emergency response organizations and the Pale Horse Compressor Station provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substance in the facility.  \n\n\n\nFive - Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Pale Horse Compressor Station has not had any accidents as of the date of this RMP. Therefore, the facility has no accident history.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Pale Horse Compressor Station resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. \n\n"
