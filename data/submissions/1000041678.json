      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Calumet policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nCalumet operates the Cotton Valley Refinery located in Webster Parish, Louisiana.  The Cotton Valley Refinery is a small specialty solvents plant capable of refining about 8,000 barrels per day (bbls/day) of sweet crude into various aliphatic solvents using both distillation and hydrotreating processes.  These specialty solvents are transported offsite via rail, truck, and pipeline.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Cotton Valley Refinery is a Program 3 process.\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.  The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nCalumet identified one regulated flammable substance and zero regulated toxic substances along with the largest single vessel quantity stored.  It was determined that a single vessel of light lean straight run (LLSR) exceeded threshold quanti"

The identification of this exceedance indicated that the Cotton Valley Refinery is a covered process with regulated substances subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nLOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATION\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery has coordinated its emergency response activities with the local emergency planning and response agencies as required in 40 CFR 68.90.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Cotton Valley Refinery.  Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery actively encourages all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.  This participation begins with well established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining PSM rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.

This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment.  Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings.  This information also provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) study to perform these evaluations.  A HAZOP uses a highly structured approach where process parameters such as flow and temperature are examined for deviations from their intended design.  Deviation effects are considered in order to determine resulting potential hazards while preliminary recommendations for improvement are proposed.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are promptly and systematically addressed.

The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the PHA team.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operation procedures, the Cotton Valley Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operations, and safe work practices.  Operators demonstrating adequate knowledge to safely perform duties and tasks are allowed to work independently.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\n\n\nThe Cotton Valley Refinery issues a hot work permit for all hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.
