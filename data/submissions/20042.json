      "SummaryText": "\nThe Master's Creek Gas Plant produces natural gas liquids (NGL) from gas feed.  The plant consists of a skid-mounted cryogenic unit, a deethanizer, a regenerator, and compressor engines.  The facility is capable of processing up to 45 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas; however, it currently processes only 5.50 mmscf/d of natural gas and produces 174,000 barrels per year of NGL.  The Masters Creek Gas Plant is located in a remote area near the town of Glenmora, Louisiana.  The following is a summary of the facility's risk management program.\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker protection and public safety, as demonstrated through the accidental release and emergency response programs implemented at the Plant.  These programs provide information regarding personnel training in accidental release and response procedures, process operations, and health and safety practices; written operation and maintenance procedures for each process; hazard analysis and response; and hazard communication.  It is the Star Natural Gas Company's (SNGC) policy to implement reasonable controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances, as well as train personnel to respond, control, and mitigate releases, if necessary.   \n\n2. FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Master's Creek Gas Plant is designed to produce natural gas liquids (NGL).  Dry, sweet, natural gas is received by pipeline and processed by a skid mounted cryogenic unit, which lowers the temperature of the natural gas to form NGL.  The residue natural gas goes to a sales pipeline, and the NGL are stored on-site prior to being trucked to a sales point.  Although the facility is capable of processing up to 45 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscf/d) of natural gas, it currently processes only 5.50 mmscf/d of natural gas on an annual basis and produces 174,000 barrels per year of NGL.

      "SummaryText": " addition, the Plant produces approximately 1,000 bbls/yr of condensate, which is stored on-site prior to being trucked to a sales point.\n\nNatural gas liquids and condensate are the regulated substances that are processed and stored at the facility in amounts above the threshold limit.  Approximately 174,000 bbls/yr of NGL and 1,000 bbls/yr of condensate are produced annually.\n\n3. OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\nThe EPA-RMP*Comp Model was used to predict the worst-case and alternative release scenarios for flammable substances present at the Masters Creek Gas Plant.  Worst-case and alternative release scenarios for toxic substances were not determined due to the absence of threshold quantities of toxic substances.\n\nWorst-case:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance consists of an instantaneous release of NGL and a vapor cloud explosion.  This scenario is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the flammable substance will form a vapor cloud and no liquids will be released due to inadequate pressure.  Therefore, the use of passive mitigation systems, such as storage tank containment dikes, will not be applicable due to the nature of the substance released.  It is predicted that a worst-case release will have an off-site impact.  The end point or point at which the vapor cloud is reduced to 1 psi overpressure is estimated to be at a distance of 0.4 miles from the Plant.   SNGC maintains a series of safety devices on the system (e.g. high pressure alarms) which make it extremely unlikely that the worst case scenario would occur.\n\nAlternative-case:\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario for flammable substances at the Masters Creek Gas Plant consists of the rupture of two NGL pressurized storage tanks.  This scenario results in the release of the entire daily contents of the two tanks to the ground.  Passive mitigation measures, such as the use of storage tank containment dikes, will contain the liquids, if present.  However, it is "

The end point or point at which the vapor cloud is reduced to lower flammability limit is estimated to be at a distance of 0.1 miles from the Plant.  The use of safety devices reduces the probability of the alternative-case scenario occurring.\n\n4. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION  \n    STEPS\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant is subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  The practices employed at this facility which are most important to the PSM accident prevention program are described in more detail below.  This accident prevention program is also applied to all RMP covered processes at the Masters Creek Gas Plant.  \n\nEmployee Participation\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Masters Creek Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective of preventing or minimizing the effects of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement ensures that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communication is encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in developing and implementing safety and accident prevention standards.  Safety meetings, special training programs for emergency response and first aid, and hazard communication training are scheduled on a regular basis to ensure that employees are properly trained in health and safety issues and have the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding such issues.  Employees are also encouraged to discuss safety and accident prevention practices with their supervisors if they have questio"

Technical documents describing process operations and process design and construction are available to all employees, including operators, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team members, training coordinators, contractors, pre-startup safety review team members, and emergency preparedness team members.  These documents describe the properties and hazards of all process chemicals and include specific chemical inventories; the limits of key process parameters; and the equipment design basis/configuration including the materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment.  This information, in combination with written safety procedures and trained personnel, provide the basis for developing and implementing all inspection and maintenance procedures, as well as evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant has developed a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with process operations are identified and controlled.  In this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards should it become necessary.  Process operations are evaluated using the what-if checklist method by a team of employees who are familiar with the operation and maintenance and the engineering specifications of each process.  The team identifies the potential hazards associated with each process, evaluates the existing accident prevention and mitigation measures for each process, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures as necessary.

All management-approved mitigation measures identified by the PHA team are tracked from start to finish.  The final resolution of each PHA team finding is documented and retained in the PHA files.\n\nThe PHA team conducts a hazard analysis review every five years for the life of the process to ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not significantly deviate from the original design safety features.  The results and findings of these PHA reviews are documented and retained in the PHA files and are forwarded to management for consideration.  The final resolution of each PHA team finding is documented and retained in the PHA files.   \n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures for all process operations.  These procedures include specific instructions and details pertaining to safety precautions, process hazards, and process operations.  The operating procedures manual is written in a clear, concise tone so that it is applicable to both new and experienced operators.\n\nTraining\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant has developed a comprehensive process operation and safety training program for its employees.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safety at the time of hire.  All other employees receive refresher training on process operations and safety on an annual basis to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.\n\nContractors\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant has developed operation and safety procedures for contractors that work at the facility during periods of increased maintenance or construction.

Training of affected personnel in these areas ensures that operation and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner. \n\nManagement of Change\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant has established a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions) and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized by management prior to implementation.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  Operation and maintenance personnel are then provided the necessary training on the change.\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program requirements of the PSM program, the Masters Creek Gas Plant has installed safety devices on process equipment in order to ensure the safe operation of all processes.  These devices aid in the detection, containment and/or control, and mitigation of accidental releases of regulated substances within the facility.  (Detection devices include process detectors and alarms; containment and/or control devices include process relief valves, isolation valves, automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters, atmospheric relief devices, and redundant equipment and instrumentation, such as an uninterruptible power supply for process control systems; and mitigation devices include fire suppression and extinguishing systems and personal protective equipment, such as chemical protective clothing and self-contained breathing apparatus).  Collectively, these prevention program elements"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past five years, there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Masters Creek Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response manual to provide employees with information regarding worker protection and public safety, in the event of a fire or explosion caused by the accidental release of a flammable substance.  The procedures address the notification of local emergency response agencies, post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and employee training requirements.  The emergency response manual is updated when modifications are made to the Masters Creek Gas Plant facilities and changes are administered through the management of change process.  \n\nThe emergency response program for the Masters Creek Gas Plant has been developed to work in coordination with the Rapides Parish Sheriff Department, the Glenmora Fire Department, and the Louisiana State Police Department Troop E Unit.  Around-the-clock communications have been established between these departments and the Masters Creek Gas Plant, as well as the appropriate local emergency planning commission (LEPC) officials and other emergency response organizations.  Periodic meetings of the emergency response committee facilitate incident response and public notification procedures.\nEmergency drills are carried periodically as part of the ongoing training process.  A post drill review is conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the plan.  Any areas that have been identified as needing improvement are then addressed, and the plan is modified.  The modifications are then "
