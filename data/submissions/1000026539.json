Material Safety Data Sheets and other chemical related safety information are readily available to employees.\n\n\n\nFacility & Regulated Substances:   \n\nFCI receives stores, uses, and ships Aqua Ammonia.  This is a small portion of the facility's business.  The facilities primary role is a fertilizer, blending and distributing facility.  The facility has one 20,000 gallon storage tank.  The facility receives inbound Aqua Ammonia by tanker truck.  The tank system is used for storage of the material until it is sold for use to a customer or used in fertilizer blending. \n\n\n\nWorst-case Scenario:\n\nThe Worst-case scenario would be the release of the entire volume of the storage tank into the containment area.\n\n\n\nAlternate-release Scenario:\n\nThe Alternate-release scenario would be the release of the substance from a hose leak with employee intervention by closing a valve; the release being captured by the containment area. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nPreventative measures in place consist of inspections, and regular maintenance inspection/evaluation of all equipment. \n\nOperating and maintenance procedures are in place.  Training programs for employees are reviewed and kept up to date.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident Plan: \n\nFCI has had no accidental releases within the last five years.  \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:  \n\nIn the event of an emergency, coordination has been established with the Hoke County Emergency Management Services.\n\nEmployees have been informed of the Emergency Response Plan. \n\n\n\nUpcoming Changes to Safety Procedures: \n\nEquipment, procedures and training programs are being reviewed and updated to improve the safety required by the ongoing review process.
