      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nFresh Leaf Farms conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Fresh Leaf Farms facility acts as the stationary source for regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia which is used as a refrigerant in their cold storage and glycol and water chilling operations. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to Appendix A.2 in the hardcopy RMP. The refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes: screw and reciprocating type compressors, evaporative condenser, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room evaporative cooling coils, makeup water chiller, glycol chillers, water storage tank, ammonia detection, control systems, and a diffusion tank.

      "SummaryText": "hilling systems are each composed of a plate in frame type ammonia-glycol chiller, glycol storage tank, and two glycol pumps. Glycol chiller skids operate as connected to main system during the season when they are onsite. The facility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the high-pressure receivers during the off-season. All of the refrigeration equipment except the condenser, diffusion tank, one low-pressure receiver (LPR-2) and cold room fan coil valve stations and piping headers are located indoors. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temp or ammonia detection . All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical rooms for alarming. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident. The refrigeration systems at the facility were constructed as per applicable codes and industry standards at the time of construction. The total refrigeration charge of approximately 11,200 lb is completely sealed and pressurized within the system. The ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for this system is shown in Section V.A.2 in the hardcopy RMP. Refrigeration drawings are located in Appendix A.2-System Drawings in the hardcopy RMP. A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix F in the hardcopy RMP. Fixed and portable refrigeration equipment locations can be found on the plans located on sheets R1.0 and R2.0 in the hardcopy RMP. International Institute "

      "SummaryText": "of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) \"Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists,\" located in Appendix A.1 in the hardcopy RMP, describe equipment details. Anhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 in the hardcopy RMP for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nFresh Leaf Farms maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix J-Incident Investigation in the hardcopy RMP. The ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually. All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nA"

      "SummaryText": "ccording to Fresh Leaf Farms personnel, in the past five years there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Coordinator is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The Safety Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A description of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N in the hardcopy RMP.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII in the hardcopy RMP. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by a qualified person. Some corrective items in the recommendation table originate from multiple codes but are listed only once. Specific facility areas and systems categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection; some of which may repeat general Process Hazard Analysis and Code Compliance Review items. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\n\nAll refrigeration equipment is well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation.\n\n"
