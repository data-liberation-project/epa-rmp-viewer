Pleasant Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substance handled.  This facility is a manufacturing process that produces Thermco-Foamed-in-Place Insulation, which is sold to certified installers throughout the United States. Our manufacturing plant has a 37% Formaldehyde Solution on the premises in a 48,000 pound storage capacity.  It is delivered by a tanker with a 46,000 pound capacity, which is processed within a 72 hour period.  This activity currently occurs about once a month.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The processing system is designed, and installed with safety valves and maintained on a daily basis during the processing period. \n\nWe have never had an accident involving the 37% formaldehyde that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, since our incorporation in 1983.\n\nThe emergency response program.  In the event of an emergency involving our processing system, it is our policy to notify the Mt. Pleasant Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and have all appropriate hazard indications on the outside doors.\n\nWe continue working with McCulley and Associates to help improve safety as an over all review."
