The operations at Baker & Baker include the manufacturing of frozen dough and bakery products for chain restaurant customers and the wholesale baking industry, packaged under various recognized brand names.  Baker & Baker has been in operation at this facility for nearly 30 years providing quality products and over 175 jobs to the local community.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nBaker & Baker is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment.  It is Baker & Baker?s policy to maintain a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and comply with all applicable regulations, including 40 CFR 68 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration?s (OSHA?s) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTo ensure the quality of Baker & Baker?s ingredients and final products, refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for the food processing and storage areas of the plant.  These requirements are promulgated and monitored by the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Illinois State Department of Health.  To achieve this, Baker & Baker uses anhydrous ammonia, the 112(r) regulated substance, as the primary refrigerant in the cooling system.  The ammonia refrigeration system maintains the 125,000 square-foot facility within the required range of operating temperatures and provides cooling for the manufacturing and storage of all products.  Anhydrous ammonia is a standard refrigerant for the food industries and widely used throughout the count"

      "SummaryText": "ry.  The refrigeration system at Baker & Baker is a closed loop system and consists of receiver vessels, compressors, evaporators, condensers, chillers, and associated piping.  The system can contain a maximum amount of approximately 12,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at any time during the course of the year.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance, covered by the EPA?s Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions and the associated Risk Management Program requirements, that is used at the Elk Grove Village facility.\n\n\nWorst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, Baker & Baker has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release, over a 10-minute period, of the entire contents of the largest vessel or pipe in the facility?s system.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations, however, based on the facility?s operating history, it is not considered by Baker & Baker to be a likely release scenario for the facility.  A more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by Baker & Baker taking into consideration the facility?s history of operational experience and the hazards identified in the process hazard analysis (PHA) conducted for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The PHA was conducted in accordance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management regulations, contained in 29 CFR 1910.119, to ensure that potential hazards are identified and evaluated to minimize the potential of occurrence.\n\nUsing the equations in Appendix E of the EPA?s General Risk Management Program Guidance document and the EPA?s RMP*Comp computer program, the maximum distances to the ?endpoint? specified for anhydrous ammonia were calculated for both scenarios and reported to the EPA.  The chemical-specific endpoints, established for release scenarios by the EPA, provide conservative estimates of the distance"

The refrigeration system was installed at the facility in 1992 and it was designed and constructed in accordance with recognized engineering and industry codes and standards. \n\nBaker & Baker has also developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the refrigeration system for the potential to release anhydrous ammonia.  Some of the controls installed to detect, prevent, or mitigate catastrophic releases of ammonia include process equipment (pressure relief valves, check valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs), automated controls (interlocks, automatic shutoffs, ammonia leak detection systems, and electrical distribution system grounding) and process alarms and emergency response procedures. \n\nBaker & Baker has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system.  These procedures incorporate safety measures to prevent employee injury, equipment damage, and accidental releases.  The procedures were developed by a team consisting of personnel from operations and maintenance, plant engineering, and Baker & Baker?s refrigeration contractor.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Baker & Baker, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\n\nBaker & Baker understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Baker & Baker has implemented a preventative maintenance program.

Each audit incorporates a review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up safety review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\nA third party safety consultant conducts monthly plant safety inspections and Baker & Baker?s insurance carrier performs independent loss prevention audits each year.\n\nIn addition, the facilities and/or records of Baker & Baker are inspected and audited by the following:\n\nThe Illinois State Department of Health.\n\nThe Elk Grove Village Fire Department.\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe Cook County Department of Environmental Control.\n\nThe Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, Baker & Baker has not experienced any reportable releases of anhydrous ammonia from the refrigeration system.

These programs include the measures to be taken by Baker & Baker including emergency notifications, on-site and off-site coordination, ammonia release procedures and evacuation procedures. \n\nIn addition, Baker & Baker has an emergency response team consisting of plant personnel trained to respond to various emergency situations including the accidental release of ammonia.  These personnel are trained in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA?s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response regulations, for their response duties and functions.  Response team personnel receive initial training and annual refresher training thereafter.\n\nTo ensure that local response personnel are familiar with Baker & Baker?s facility and their emergency response procedures, tours of the facility and a copy of the facility?s Emergency Response Plan have been provided to the Elk Grove Village Fire Department.\n\nIn addition to the local fire department, Baker & Baker has arranged for emergency response assistance with two local refrigeration contractors knowledgeable in the facility layout and the design and operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Baker & Baker facility is located in an industrial park covering a large portion of Elk Grove Village, and as a result, there are very few residential, community, and environmental receptors in the area.
