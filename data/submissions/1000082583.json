It is PP's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out. As part of this policy, PP has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at PP and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:lll, Chapter 59). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at PP. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at PP.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nPP is committed to the safety of the general public and PP employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases hazardous substances in and around the facility. PP utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases. In the event of a release, the facility has an emergency response team trained to contain, mitigate, monitor and stop the release.   Additionally, the emergency response team is fully staffed and trained for fire fighting, and other emergency situations such as natural disasters and bomb threats. In addition"

In conjunction with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the facility has ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and other methods available to the LEPC.\r\nThe PP President has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program. However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report to the President either directly or through other management personnel. Those relationships are depicted on the plant organization chart. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM) and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Regulatory Affairs and Human Resources Manager. The plant's emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is also the responsibility of the Regulatory Affairs and Human Resources Manager.\r\n\r\nPP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nPP is a manufacturer of polypropylene and is located in Garyville, Louisiana. The PP process contains propylene which is a flammable substance that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and is present in the process above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. Toxic substances used or stored at PP do not meet or exceed the listed threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the PP. Because the processes at the facility that are regulated by the EPA's RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM eleme"

The PSM program at this facility has been extended by PP, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\r\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\r\nPP encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. PP consults with employees on the conduct and development of Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) and the development of the elements of OSHAA\u00bfs Process Safety management (PSM) standard. Employees have access to all information created as part of PP's PSM and accident prevention programs.\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nPP completes a compilation of written Process Safety Information before conducting any PHA required by the OSHA PSM standard. The compilation of written process safety information is to enable PP and the employees involved in operating the process to identify and understand the hazards posed by those processes involving highly hazardous chemicals. This Process Safety Information includes information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, to the technology of the process, and to the equipment in the process.\r\nInformation pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process consists of the following:\r\na.\tToxicity information;\r\nb.\tPermissible exposure limits;\r\nc.\tPhysical data;\r\nd.\tReactivity data;\r\ne.\tCorrosivity data;\r\nf.\tThermal and chemical stability data; and,\r\ng.\tHazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foresee ably occur.\r\nThe above chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is normally provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\r\nInformation pertaining to the technology of the process includes the following:\r\na.\tProcess chemistry;\r\nb.\tMaximum intended inventory;\r\nc.\tSafety upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressure, flows or compositions; and,\r\nd.\tAn evaluation of th"

If a change in the SOPs or practices, such procedures or practices are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW (PSSR)\r\nPP performs a PSSR on new facilities and modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The PSSR shall confirm that prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals to a process:\r\na.\tConstruction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications;\r\nb.\tSafety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate;\r\nc.\tFor new facilities, PHA has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented before star"

An incident investigation team shall be established and consist of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contractor if the incident involved the work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. Findings of the incident are documented in a report. PP promptly addresses and resolves the incident report findings and recommendations.   Resolutions and corrective actions are documented. The report is reviewed with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the incident findings including contract employees where applicable. Incident Investigation reports are retained for five years.\r\n\r\nHOT WORK PERMITS\r\nPP uses a Hot Work Permit System for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process. The permit is designed to document that the fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations. The permit is kept on file for one year.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTORS\r\nPP uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. PP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner; (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills; (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace; (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; (5) understand and follow site safety rules; and, (6) inform PP personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\r\nWhen selecting a contractor, PP obtains and evaluates information regarding the cont"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, PP has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\na.\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\na.\tAutomatic Emergency Feed Shutdowns;\r\nb.\tAutomatic and manual sprinkler systems;\r\nc.\tCentralized alarm system;\r\nd.\tFully trained emergency response team;\r\ne.\tCommunications systems (e.g. radio, emergency phones, PA system, emergency call procedures);\r\nf.\tFire water system (e.g. hydrants, monitors, hose stations, backup firewater systems); and,\r\ng.\tDiking and burn pits for pyrophoric liquids.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nNo releases of regulated substances have occurred in the last five years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\nPP maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which aims to protect employees, public health, and the environment. The purpose of the ERP is to minimize the impact on the facility and surrounding areas in the event of an emergency situation.   The plan consists of procedures for responding to emergencies such as fires or flammable vapor releases, medical emergencies, hurricanes, tornadoes, power outages, radiological emergencies, and bomb threats. The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including responsibilities of the Emergency Respons"
