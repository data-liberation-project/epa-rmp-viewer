              "Description": "FP International periodically assigns a team of employees to identify equipment, operating procedures and conditions where the potential could exist for employee exposure to safety hazards or for the creation of hazards to the environment or the surrounding community due to an accident in our plant.  Potential hazards could involve an accidental release to the atmosphere of isobutane or isopentane or the spill of liquid isopentane.  The \"What If\" methodology was selected for the process hazard analysis at this facility.  The Process Hazard Analysis Team consists of a minimum of three employees.  The team has expertise in engineering, process operations and maintenance and includes at least one person with knowledge and experience specific to each process being reviewed.  The PHA Team develops \"What If\" questions and identiifies consequences, safeguards, recommendations ranked severity and likelihood.  Once recommendations have been made, they are submitted to the Manager of Manufacturing for approval.  A process hazard analysis is made for each process at least once every five years, and a copy ot the analysis is kept at the facility.",

The same properties that make these materials valuable as blowing agents in our manufacturing processes also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling them. These precautions are in place to prevent the unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the health of our employees, and to reduce the threat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle isobutane, isopentane and ethane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our employees helps insure the safety of our employees and of the surrounding community. Our emergency response program is meant to comply with the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Law (Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory Act). FP International's response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  \n\n2) Stationary source and regulated substance handled\n\nA) At our Newark facility, FP International uses recycled polystyrene in manufacturing our product. In the process to make foamed foamed polystyrene, isobutane and isopentane blowing agents are injected into the polymer melt during the extrusion processes.  One 5393 gallon storage tank is used to store isobutane, and one 5500 gallon storage tank is used to store isopentane.\n\nB) The regulated substances handled at this facility are isobutane and isopentane.\n\nC) The maximum amount of these materials stored at this facility is 46,000 pounds. \n\n3) General accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThis manufacturing facility complies with the EPA's Accident Prevention R"

As part of our Corporate Injury Illness and Prevention Plan all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to the training received upon employment, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job which exposes them to new hazards. Our Corporate Hazard Communication Plan, which is located in our safety manual, contains safe work practices, descriptions of the use and care of personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases. Emergency and first-aid procedures are also covered.    \n\n4) Five year accident history  \n\nThere have been no releases at this facility during this period.\n\n5) The emergency response program\n\nThis facility's Emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook. \n\n6) Planned changes to improve safety\n\nMonthly safety inspections are conducted at this facility and safety deficiencies are corrected as they occur. No major upgrades to this facility are planned at this time."
