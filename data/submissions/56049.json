Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System and the Chlorine System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 prevention program would become a requirement for these processes as well.  The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n\n1.4.1 Program Level 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations Program Level 3 Prevention Program that addresses the EPA RMP Rule Prevention Program requirements for the Chlorine Systems and Chlorine Dioxide Solution Systems.\n\nA. Employee Participation - The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of GP/Crossett employees are addressed.  The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities of all processes at the facility.  Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n\nB. Process Safety Information - The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure the safe operation of the processes.  The documents address (1) the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, (2) the technical data of the process, and (3) the design basis and configurations of the equipment used in the processes.  The facility ensures that this process safety information is"

There are also several environmental receptors.\n\nB. The alternative release scenario for chlorine is the failure of a one-inch diameter transfer line, releasing 179 pounds per minute for 15 minutes before it could be isolated.  The released chlorine will evaporate to form a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic end point concentration, based on the RMP*Comp output, is 0.6 miles.  Landview 6, which includes the 2000 United States Census, indicates that approximately 221 people live within this distance.  Several public receptors are also located within this distance (public elementary school, several industrial facilities, several recreation parks, and several subdivisions).  There are also several environmental receptors.\n\nC. The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide six-inch solution line located at the discharge side of the ClO2 transfer pump\u00bfs header.  During normal operations, the pump could pump approximately 26 lbs per minute for 5 minutes before the release would be stopped by the automated shut-off valves.  The released chlorine dioxide solution will form a pool of minimum depth (1 cm) and evaporate to form a vapor cloud.

As part of this commitment, GP/Crossett has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at GP/Crossett.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of four elements:\n\n\u00bf A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide and chlorine) \u00bf see topic 1.2\n\n\u00bf A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) \u00bfsee topic 1.4\n\n\u00bf An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes \u00bf see topic 1.6\n\n\u00bf A management system that delineates responsibility for implementing and maintaining the Risk Management Program.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only o"

EPA has provided a modeling program (RMP*Comp) to determine the endpoints.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, such as chlorine dioxide or chlorine, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.\n\nThe RMP Rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by Georgia-Pacific Crossett Operations.  These requirements include:\n\n\u00bf One worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\u00bf One alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine and one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\nThe following information summarizes the off- site consequence analysis performed by GP/Crossett.\n\n1.3.1  Program Level 3 Processes - Chlorine (Cl2) Systems and the Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) Solution System\n\na.
