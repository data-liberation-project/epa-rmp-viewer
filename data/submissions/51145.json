      "SummaryText": "Wells' Dairy, Inc. (WDI) has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP Plan) to meet the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) as outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) for the use and storage of ammonia in the industrial refrigeration system at the Omaha Yogurt Plant (OYP) located in Omaha, NE.\nWDI utilizes the applicable elements of it's OSHA regulated Process Safety Management (PSM) program (29 CFR 1910) to fulfill the requirements of the level 3 release prevention portion of the RMP Plan.  Process specific training is provided to maintenance and operator/mechanic personnel to ensure that the refrigeration system's mechanical integrity is maintained throughout the life of the process.  Administrative controls are in place to manage process and equipment changes so that training and accident prevention programs can be modified accordingly.  The various facets of the RMP Plan and PSM program are linked through documentatiion and communication.\nAn Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) was developed for responses to various personnel, chemical, and weather related emergencies.  The ICP documents the processes for emergency response, training, resource management, and information tracking for possible emergency incidents that may occur at this facility.  The ICP also documents the lines fo authority for personnel that may need to manage and/or respond to incidents at the facility.\nWDI addresses and incorporates recommendations resulting from action items developed from process hazard analyses, off-site consequence analyses, incident investigations, and program audit findings.  Continuous improvement of the RMP allows WDI to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of ammonia to employees, the public, or the environment."
