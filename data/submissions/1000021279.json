One of the chemicals used in the disinfection process is Chlorine.  \n\nThe water treatment plant purchases chlorine in one (1) ton steel cylinders and are kept in an enclosed building with a ventilation system that is connected to a Chlorine Scrubber System.  This Scrubber system is automatically engaged when chlorine gas is detected in the room.  The maximum quantity stored at the water treatment facility is 12,000 pounds.\n\nRelease Prevention and Emergency Response Policies and Chemical specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Stillwater Water Treatment Plant is dedicated to the safety of their employees and to the citizens living in the area.  The water plant utilizes employee training, written policies, maintenance procedures, technology, and emergency backup systems to achieve a safe working environment and to limit the potential of a chlorine gas release to the atmosphere. \n \nTraining:  \nAll new employees work with an experienced plant operator to achieve on the job training.\n\nAnnually, all employees, must receive 4 hours renewal training as per Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality rules and regulations for license recertification.\n\nAll Stillwater employees attend quarterly safety training under PEOSH regulations.\nAll water plant employees attend monthly safety meetings.\n\nChlorine System Policy\n\nTwo operators will always be present when working on chlorine cylinders or in the chlorine room.\nThe exhaust fan will be turned on before operator enters the chlorine building.\nOne of the two operators will remain outside of the chlorine room and observe the other operator while he is in the room.\nWhen changing leads from one cylinder to another cylinder, a new lead washer will always be used.\nOperators will immediately notify the "

Check facemasks and air hoses for nicks or cracks.\n\nMonthly:\nHoist system\nCheck hoist and travel limit device.  If any problem is found correct it immediately.\nInspect cables and lifting bar.  If excessive wear or damage is found, replace immediately.\nInspect trolley wheels, fasteners, track wheel stud nuts and suspension bolts.\nCheck cables and leads for broken wires, loose or corroded terminals, and damaged insulation.\nCheck wheels for bearing wear, as indicated by excessive looseness of wheel on stud.  Also check track for wear.\n\nAnnualy the entire hoist system is inspected and certifed by Gaffy Crane.\n\nChlorine Scales:\n\nInspect for wear each time chlorine cylinders are replaced.\nRe-set tare weights to 4000 lbs. after replacing new cylinders.\nCheck for frayed wire insulation and loose connections.\n\nChlorine Detectors: (Tank storage room and chlorinator feeder room)\nCheck chlorine detectors control module for proper operation\nMix a week solution of sodium hypochlorite in squeeze bottle.
