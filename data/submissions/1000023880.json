This belief covers on and off-job injuries, occupational illnesses and accidental releases.  DuPont is also committed to keeping its facilities ready to respond to any incident that occurs in spite of our best prevention efforts.\n\nDuPont established PSM on a Corporate basis in 1979.  General definitions, policies and organizational structure that implement PSM are given in Section S21A of the DuPont Safety and Occupational Health Guidelines.  PSM goals, policies and procedures are embodied in numerous corporate manuals and documents such as Engineering Standards, Safety Manuals and Guidelines.\n\nDuPont's LaPorte Plant endorses, adheres to and carries out Corporate PSM policies, procedures and guidelines.  The DuPont LaPorte Plant's Accidental Release Prevention policies come within the scope of the site's existing Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  We apply PSM to all processes and chemicals at this site, not just those covered by the RMP Regulation.\n\nThe stated purpose of the LaPorte Plant's PSM Program is to manage and control the hazards in our processes, to protect individuals, plant equipment, our business integrity, and our community through the elimination of hazards.  PSM involves the application of controls to our processes through operating & maintenance procedures and practices, training, management of change, equipment inspection, and auditing.\n\nThe Principles that govern the DuPont LaPorte Plant's PSM actions are:\n--All injuries, incidents and occupational illnesses are preventable.  We will work in a proactive,preventive mode rath"

All elements of the site's Risk Management Program, including safety, regulatory compliance, prevention of accidental spills and releases, and emergency response fall within the scope of the Plant Manager's responsibilities.  Safety is also considered to be each employee's individual responsibility.\n\nBelow the Plant Manager level, there are three (3) Unit Managers (one for each of the major businesses previously listed) who report to the Plant Manager.  Each Unit Manager is responsible for Process Safety Management (PSM), spill/release prevention, regulatory compliance and many aspects of Emergency Response within his/"

The facility is not open to the public.  Security personnel are on duty 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to observe and control all site ingress and egress and  to perform frequent on-site and perimeter patrols.

Our RMP information was actively communicated to the public in a series of Roll-out events conducted in February and March 1999.

An Emergency Response Team (ERT) is on duty at the facility 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\nThe sounding of the site-wide alarm also initiates a number of other processes including:\n  --immediate mobilization of site emergency response resources\n  --preliminary assessment of the situation\n  --personnel accounting\n  --dispersion modeling to gauge the potential for off-site impact\n  --establishment of a Command Post near the incident location\n\nAt the Command Post, an Incident Commander (IC) takes charge of the situation and organizes and directs the ERT.

The Risk Management Plan has been revised to reflect these changes. A sphere risk reduction project (which included adding a water mitigation system) was completed, reducing Hydrofluoric Acid inventory by 82%, as compared to the design capacity of each sphere. Administrative and engineering controls continue to be implemented which have decreased the worst-case distances for several of the scenarios."
