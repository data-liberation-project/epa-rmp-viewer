If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Floyd County Fire Departmenty and request that they respond to our emergency.\n\nThis facility is a propane distribution facility.  The primary purpose is the distribution of propane gas to our customers via tank truck.  This facility receives propane by tank truck. This facility consists of sixteen 30,000 gallon propane tanks, and all necessary piping, valves, and pump to facilitate transfer of propane into and out of the bulk stoarage tank.  \n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of a 30,000 gallon propane tank when filled to 85 percent, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the EPA's, RMP*Comp, the distance to the end point is .4 miles.  \n\nThere are approximately 234 people living within this distance.  There are no schools, or hospitals within this distance.  There are no environmental receptors.  The alternative case scenario results in a .02 mile distance to end point.  There are 12 people living within this distance.  \n\nThis facility complies with EPA's,accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane systems are designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.  \n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.  In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the Floyd County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the Fire Department and members of the Fire Department have inspected our propane system.\n\nWe have no plans at the present time to change our safety processes and procedures."
