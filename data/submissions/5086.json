EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure.  EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate.  In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions.  For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.\n\nIn addition, the Hopewell plant is required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario for each covered chemical.\n\nWorst Case -- Toxic\n\nOur worst-case toxic scenario is the failure of a pressurized ammonia storage tank, resulting in the release of the entire contents of the tank in 10 minutes. Since the AlliedSignal Hopewell plant is located within the City of Hopewell, any gas cloud formed by the evaporating ammonia could reach public areas.  The effects offsite of a worst-case scenario would be in a downwind direction both within the plant and beyond the plant boundary.\n\nAlternative Release -- Toxic\n\na) Anhydrous Ammonia\nA plausible alternative release scenario for ammonia is a pipe flange or gasket leak from a transfer hose.  This release of ammonia over a 10-minute period would have a minimal downwind impact.  The effect offsite would be minimal due to low vapor concentration and the sparse residential population just outside the immediate plant boundaries.\n\nb) Chlorine\nA plausible alternative release scenario for chlorine is the failure of the relief device on the cylinder.  In this case, the entire contents of the chlorine cylinder are released.  Based on the plant location and proximity of the cylinders to the fence line, offs"

The ensuing gas cloud will have a minor off site consequence to adjacent industrial sites.\n\nd) Methyltrichlorosilane\nA plausible alternative case scenario for methyl trichlorosilane is the failure of a pump seal.  In this situation, the liquid is contained within a dike and evaporates slowly.  The gas can be carried off site into the community immediately adjacent to the plant where it will dissipate.\n\ne) Oleum\nA plausible alternative case scenario for oleum involves a transfer line leak within the dike area surrounding the storage tanks.  The dike contains the liquid and the vapors released dissipate before they reach the community immediately adjacent to the plant.\n\nf) Ammonia Solution (22%)\nA plausible alternative release scenario for 22% ammonia solution is a failure of the drain valve on the bottom of the storage tank.  The release involves a significant volume of liquid ammonia solution.  Due to process drains near the tank, the release of ammonia from the solution would not have any offsite consequences.\n\nWorst Case -- Flammable\n\nThe RMP rule requires us to evaluate the impact of our worst-case flammable scenario.  This was done for acetaldehyde.  In this case, the impact of a vapor cloud explosion has been evaluated.  There would be a minimal offsite impact to an adjacent industrial site from a worst case release of acetaldehyde.\n\nAlternative Release - Flammable\n\nA plausible alternative case scenario for acetaldehyde is the failure of a transfer line gasket causing a gas leak.  If this gas finds an ignition source an explosion will occur.  The impact of the explosion extends beyond the plant boundaries to impact an adjacent industrial site.\n\nProcess Safety Accident Prevention Program:\n\nThe employees at the AlliedSignal Hopewell plant are committed to t"

Each process change or process modification undergoes rigorous technical evaluation using the highest standards of personal and community safety as the focal point.  We review the process hazard analyses on a continuing 5-year cycle so that we maintain a high degree of integrity in the safety of our processes.  Each PHA uses the appropriate methodology to analyze potential hazards, their affects and provides for timely resolution of recommendations.  Recent hazard analyses have shown the need for additional redundant environmental control systems for those rare occasions when the primary control system requires preventative maintenance.  As a result, we have added these controls.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are structured to cover all aspects of plant operation including startup, shutdown, normal operations, upset conditions and emergency response. Each operating area of the plant has specific operating procedures developed by those people most knowledgeable in the plant operation, operators and area supervisors.  Other process operators and supervisors review these procedures for accuracy and consistency.    After review, the department manager who verifies that they are accurate and up-to-date annually certifies the operating procedures.  Operators work closely with process engineers as process modifications take place to make sure the operating procedures include information relating to the process changes.\n\nTraining\n\nBesides standard operating procedures, the Hopewell plant has developed extensive training materials to support the development of individuals into highly trained and qualified process operators.

The Hopewell plant operators are required to complete a three-year training program before becoming fully qualified.  To assist in documenting and tracking employee training, we have installed a software program, which involves self-directed learning, online information databases and integrated procedures and training manuals. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nMechanical integrity of plant equipment is another way we reduce the probability and consequences of catastrophic releases.  We assure that equipment is fit for its intended service.  Extensive on-going inspection programs are key to maintaining the process equipment. Guidelines and procedures have been developed and are followed by people performing the inspections.  They are trained and qualified to analyze data and provide operations with timely information for continued safe equipment operation.  Quality assurance of new equipment, processes and spare parts provide additional confidence that the equipment containing the process chemicals will perform as designed.  For example, process vessels holding chemicals are inspected/evaluated on a preset timetable using visual and ultrasonic thickness testing methods.  Based on the results of these tests, appropriate actions are taken to assure that the vessels are deemed fit-for-service.  Specifically, the large ammonia storage vessels considered in the worst case scenario description are taken out of service on a scheduled basis for comprehensive integrity evaluations.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nManaging change is one of the most important activities associated with process safety and risk management.

Our ammonia storage tank, for example, has an electronic pressure monitoring interlock, which upon sensing a high pressure sends an alarm to the "

The interlocks also trip a valve, which diverts the ammonia vapor to a secondary absorption system there by preventing a release of ammonia to the atmosphere.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nThe AlliedSignal Hopewell plant has experienced three releases based on definitions of releases provided by the EPA during the past five years.  In all three cases, the facility identified very effective actions to prevent similar incidents from occurring again. \n\n* In 1994 the plant experienced a total power failure due to a problem with the power company.  Due to this loss of power, and ensuing process upset, a process relief valve lifted, allowing ammonia to escape to the atmosphere.  The vapors drifted off site before dissipating to minimally detectable levels.  A local business employee reported some minor discomfort from the low ammonia concentrations. To correct the situation of power failures, the AlliedSignal Hopewell plant has worked extensively with the power company. Together we have achieved a very high degree of power stability, i.e., no total plant power failures in the last 3 years.  \n\n* In 1996, during the startup of our ammonia plant, a relief valve lifted due to a process upset and ammonia vapors again drifted off-site.  The plant evaluated other ammonia facilities and determined that a change in startup operating procedures could eliminate future occurrences.  We changed our procedure and have been operating since that time without any ammonia releases during startup or shutdown of the ammonia plant.\n\n* In 1997, a pump seal failed on a methyltrichlorosilane pump allowing methyltrichlorosilane to escape and caused discomfort to an individual at a nearby facility.  The process was examined and it was determined that the pump was not required and the pump was removed from the process.  We have operated since then with no additional releases.\n\nThus, we implemented very effective actions to prevent these releases from recurring.\n\nContinuing Sa"

      "SummaryText": "fety Improvements:\n\nThe AlliedSignal Hopewell plant continually strives to improve process safety at the site.  Anytime new equipment is installed, it receives several reviews in our ongoing effort to maintain proven quality equipment.  Also, with each new piece of equipment, we track its performance to ensure that it operates in a manner that helps us toward our plant goals of zero environmental and safety incidents.  The plant receives audits, both internal and federally mandated, which help improve the level of safety performance.  \n\nAlso, the plant benchmarks neighboring companies looking for ways to continually achieve a higher level of safety.  Although not considered a benchmark opportunity, we found that a comprehensive incident investigation program would enhance our ability to avoid recurrence of past incidents.  As one part of the investigation tool, we trained about 180 salaried and hourly employees in root cause analysis techniques.  This investigative system is a methodology that drives towards removing and correcting the causes of equipment and procedural failures.  It is widely used to help improve our level of safety and environmental performance.\n\nWe continually evaluate the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  Recently we determined that tank car quantities of chlorine were not necessary for treating incoming river water.  The tank car was replaced by smaller quantities of chlorine in 1-ton cylinders.\n\nThe AlliedSignal Hopewell plant employees continue our efforts to enhance safety and reduce risks through equipment modernization and hazard analysis for the chemicals used at the site."
