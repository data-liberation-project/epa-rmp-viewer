Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nColumbine Vineyards utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in their cold storage facility located east of Delano, California.  Since the refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, Columbine Vineyards has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the ammonia based refrigeration processes.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the PSM program, Columbine Vineyards has completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration system, established a pre-startup safety review, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration systems on a daily basis, Columbine Vineyards has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration system maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nPersonnel from Columbine Vineyards monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration system.  All major service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration system are contracted to a qualified licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\n\n\nWhile it is Columbine Vineyards objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for Columbine Vineyards and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\n \n\nColumbine Vineyards has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the PSM a"

At least every three years, Columbine Vineyards will audit these programs and any findings of noncompliance will be documented and responded to and the deficiencies will be corrected.\n\n\n\n2. Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n\n\nThe Columbine Vineyards owns and operates a cold storage facility located at 33787 Cecil Avenue.  Delano is the closest city to the Columbine Vineyards cold storage facility.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant that provides process cooling for the Columbine Vineyards cold storage facility.  \n\n\n\nThe original Cecil Avenue Cold Storage facility was constructed in the 1940s.  In 1992, the ammonia based refrigeration system was substantially modernized when the cold storage facility was expanded.  The ammonia refrigeration system was expanded again in 1999 and remodeled in 2007.  The refrigeration system currently consists of the following major components:\n\n\n\n    -    Four compressors \n\n    -    Two evaporative condensers in ammonia service\n\n    -    A high pressure receiver \n\n    -    Low suction accumulator\n\n    -    Liquid ammonia transfer system\n\n    -    Five pre-cool rooms (10 zones)\n\n    -    Nine cold storage rooms (15 zones)\n\n    -    Direct expansion evaporators (hallway)\n\n\n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be A?pumped downA? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the outdoor high pressure receiver is 61,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, 40 CFR Part 68 and the CalARP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, is being im"

However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Columbine VineyardsA? employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\n\n\n6.Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThrough the accidental release prevention program, Columbine Vineyards regularly evaluates the need for any changes to improve safety.  Currently, Columbine Vineyards does not have any changes planned for the anhydrous ammonia-based refrigeration processes to improve safety.\n\n\n\n"
