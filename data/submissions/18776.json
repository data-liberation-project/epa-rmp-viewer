In 1871 progress moved dramatically forward as Harvey G. Eastman was elected Mayor. Mayor Eastman was credited as the driving force that carried out the public wishes. Through his leadership, gift of persuasion and vision the first successful slow sand filtration plant in America was placed into service in Poughkeepsie July 8, 1872. The success of this project was heralded as epidemics all but disappeared and Poughkeepsie could no longer be called a \"Sickly City\".\n\nThe success of the plant was significant to the water industry. The design criteria was followed throughout the Country as other Cities realized the benefit that filtration could bring to their community. To this day Poughkeepsie is recognized as the national leader in filtration.\n\nIn 1959, after 87 years of continuous service, the plant could no longer meet the communities thirst. Water demands had risen from 2 million gallons per day (MGD) in 1920 to a peak day demand of 10.5 MGD in 1955. Design to replace the plant began in 1959 and the new/current plant was placed into service in 1962. This plant was originally designed to provide 12 MGD, which was increased to a permitted capacity of 16 MGD in 1990. On August 3, 1995 the City of Poughkeepsie and Town of Poughkeepsie entered into an Inter-Municipal Agreement in which the Town purchased 1/3 or 5.33 MGD of the 16 MGD approved Water Treatment Facility capacity.\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPougkeepsies' Water Treatment Facility (PWTF) renamed from the City of Poughkeepsie Water Treatment Plant, after the 1995 Inter-Municipal Agreement, provides the potable water supply to 77,000 people within the City of Poughkeepsie, Town of Poughkeepsie and portions of the Village of Wappingers.

Like many other first settlements along the East Coast the first \"public\" water came from wells located at convenient corners along the streets. As Poughkeepsie grew, homes and businesses began constructing individual wells and cisterns for sewage disposal. By 1854 Poughkeepsie's population grew to 20,000. This activity caused groundwater contamination resulting in epidemics of cholera, typhoid fever, smallpox and diphtheria, which claimed hundreds of victims. To the City's embarrassment Poughkeepsie was heralded in newspapers far and wide as \"The Sickly City,\" even as far West as Chicago. One account called Poughkeepsie, \"A fine place to live, with fine schools and churches and railroad accommodations, well governed but oh, how sickly.\" Shortly thereafter the City Common Council directed Mayor Emott and two other leading citizens to \"look into the possibilities of a public water supply. Unfortunately, the drive stopped with the onset of the Civil War.\n\nIn 1870 public pressure returned. A general election to decide the question of whether or not to develop a public water supply resulted"

Hudson River raw water quality at our intake site is generally very good and very treatable by our plant process. Our finished drinking water quality is consistently excellent in respect to all applicable N.Y. State and Federal Standards for public consumption and typical industrial/agricultural use. Biological, chemical and physical\nparameters are typically outstanding. Visit our web site at www.pokwater.com for additional detailed information regarding Hudson River and PWTF Drinking water quality. Additionally this information is available directly from the PWTF [914-451-4173].  \n\nThe Poughkeepsies' Water Treatment Facility utilizes the conventional filtration process to treat the water supply.  This process includes chemical application of aluminum sulfate and organic polymer to destabilize the small particles in the raw water supply. Once destabilized the particles are combined with previously settled solids then slowly mixed to form larger particles that are then removed through settling. Following the settling process the water is aerated to improve taste and filtered through a coal and sand media that polishes the final product. Disinfection, the process used to kill disease producing organisms, is accomplished through a carefully monitored chlorination process.\n\nPost treatment includes the addition of sodium fluoride, orthophosphate and lime. Sodium fluoride is used to maintain a 1.0-mg/L fluoride concentration for dental health.  Orthophosphate is added to reduce corrosion of customer lead piping and fixtures. Lime is added to increase treated water pH in effort to minimize corrosion of pipes within the distribution system and customers plumbing.\n\nAdditional raw water treatment through the application of potassium permanganate is available to"

In 1998, over 78,000 water quality tests were conducted.  Those tests included inorganic chemicals, disinfection by-products, organic chemicals and microbiological examinations for coliforms, E-coli, giardia and cryptosporidium. In addition to individual tests we continuously monitored raw water turbidity, process turbidity throughout the plant and chlorine residuals.  Testing results demonstrate that the quality of the treated water is consistently excellent.

Since the Treatment Facility was constructed in 1962, treatment technology has changed. The plant is now responsible for the removal of contaminants that were not even known to exist when the plant was designed.  Fortunately, the plant was well designed and through diligent efforts by the staff the treated water has been exceptional except for 2 periods in 1996 when the treated water slightly exceeded the turbidity standard for a short period, due to a prolonged period of exceptionally high turbid water from the Hudson River.   \n\nThree significant driving forces direct improvements at the Water Treatment Facility: Requirement for additiona"

In accordance with the EPA and OSHA standards, the Water Treatment Facility has prepared the PSMP & RMP in order to provide information on the use of chlorine at the Facility, what its health effects are, safety procedures to be followed to reduce the likelihood of a release, and response measures in the event there is a release of this regulated substance. The purpose of this Plan is to reduce the likelihood or consequences of a serious release.\n\nThe standards require that the Water Treatment Facility examine its chlorine disinfection system to pinpoint areas that have the potential for an accidental release.  An accidental release is defined as a leak or ruptures in the system that is life threatening or harmful to workers' health. \n\nThe Facility has identified four (4) areas from which a leak may occur:\n\n1. \tDelivery and storage of the chlorine canisters on the back loading dock.\n\n2. \tMoving and storing of the canisters in the tank scale room.\n\n3. \tConnecting the canisters to the vacuum system.\n\n4. \tOperation of the rotometer feed system.\n\nThe Treatment Facility Management has also evaluated the safety practices that are implemented when working in any of the above mentioned areas. Various safety equipment and procedures have been identified as necessary for the safety of Facility personnel including, but not limited to: both chlorine rooms are monitored continuously with a chlorine alarm and the chlorine system is operated under a vacuum such that a break in the vacuum would automatically shut off the supply of chlorine. Such items are also discussed in this Plan.\n\nAlthough the Water Treatment Facility Management has evaluated the chlorine system, devel"

They include raw water (pre-chlorination); Intermediate (application before sediment basins) and final (post filtration application to final water to achieve required chlorine residual throughout community distribution system).\n\nChlorine is primarily applied at the intermediate application point, however, the system is set up to deliver chlorine to all three application points if necessary. The system is operated under vacuum, once it leaves the feed cylinder, it is designed to cut off delivery of chlorine if there is a break in the piping.\n\nSpecifically, gaseous chlorine is used for disinfection at the Facility.  Pre-filtration chlorination is the primary method of disinfection and is achieved by adding chlorine to the water as it flows from the outlet of the solids contact tanks and enters each of the sedimentation tanks. Chlorine can also be fed to the rapid mixer for algae control during the summer months. Post-filtration chlorination can be applied to the filtered water effluent header just before it enters the equalization basin. The [total] chlorine feed rate is approximately 375 lbs./day (4-5 mg/l).\n\nThe system utilizes ton chlorine canisters, which are located in a separate room on t"

Chlorine is feed from the first floor chlorine storage room to the main floor chlorine feed room, which contains four V-Notch Chlorinators.

It reacts with the organic compounds in the water initially at the various application points and as in the case with application for the final water it reacts with the water throughout the trunk and service main distribution system. The process results in the disinfection of the water supply in order to meet required public water health standards.  \n\nWhen chlorine gas is added to water, two reactions take place. They are hydrolysis and ionization.  The resulting quantity of HOCl (hypochlorous acid) and ClO-1 (hypochlorite ion) that is present in the water, given their relative distribution, yields varying efficiencies in killing of pathogenic and other micro organisms which may be harmful to human health.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMP MODEL WORST AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\n\nA.\tWorst-Case Scenario\n\nMODEL USED: American Water Works Association (AWWA) Compliance Guidance & Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants (WTP) Manual, Table 5-1, page 5-6 Scenario I.D. # CLW-2.

The response procedures identified in this plan range in scope from the response of Water Treatment Facility personnel in the event of a minor chlorine leak to the response and responsibility of the Water Treatment Facility in the event of a catastrophic release.\n\nThe development of appropriate response procedures is necessary in order to minimize health hazards to Facility employees and the surrounding community, to minimize Facility infrastructure damage, and to ensure continued operation of the Water Treatment Facility.  The objectives of the Emergency Action Plan can only be realized if Facility personnel are properly trained to identify and respond to emergency conditions and if sufficient equipment and resources are available to support an effective response when an emergency arises.\n\nSOPs are available for the response of Water Treatment Facility personnel in the event of minor and major chlorine leak occurrences. The operating procedures outline the responsibilities of Water Treatment Facility personnel and appropriate actions to be taken during leak events. These operating procedures are contained in the Attachment section of the PSMP.\n\nDutchess County Emergency Response coordinator has provided the Water Treatment Facility with a written plan of responsibilities and actions in the event of a leak that is threatening to the population of the surrounding community.  This Crisis Notification Plan is contained in the Attachment section of the PSMP.\n\nTo facilitate the above plans of action, The Fairview Fire Company has been designated as the Water Treatment Facility's emergency responder.  On a yearly basis they examine the Water Treatment Facility's chlorination system and discuss with Fa"

Cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis are intestinal illnesses caused by microscopic parasites.  Cryptosporidiosis can be very serious for people with weak immune systems such as chemotherapy, dialysis or transplant patients, and people with Chron's disease or HIV infection. People with weakened immune systems should discuss with their health care providers the need to take extra precautions such as boiling water, using a certified bottled water or a specifically approved home filter. Individuals who think they may have cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis should contact their health care provider immediately.\n\nCryptosporidium and giardia are tested in the treated water and in the Hudson River and recycled water supplies. In 1998 cryptosporidium or giardia were not in any treated water samples.\n\nFor additional information on cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis, please contact John Glass, Public Health Officer, Dutchess County Department of He"

In 1998, testing of customers tap water in both the City and Town of Poughkeepsie determined lead levels in 95-percent of those households has been reduced from 28 (g/L in 1992 to 15 (g/L (the federally mandated standard).  This program has proven to be very successful and we anticipate further reduction in lead levels at customer's taps as this program continues.\n\nPilot Plant\n  \nIn 1998, we completed construction of a Pilot Plant at the Treatment Facility.  This pilot plant is capable of completely modeling all of our treatment processes at a flow of up to 10 gpm or 1/1,000th of the full plant capacity.  The pilot plant is currently being operated to model our existing processes in effort to optimize treatment and as a training tool for our staff.  In 1999, we will evaluate treatment enhancements that can be implemented to further improve quality and reliability, reduce costs and increase plant capacity without the construction of new processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWATER CONSERVATION\n\nWater Conservation is the responsibility of every citizen and can be accomplished in easy to implement activities. Here are some of the ways you can save water.\n\n* Repair all plumbing leaks promptly.  To find a leak, turn off all water-using equipment \n  for 20 minutes. Read your water meter at the beginning and end of the 20 minutes - the \n  reading should be the same. If not, suspect a leak and take action.\n\n* Use low flow showerheads, toilets and other water saving devices.\n\n* Water only in the evening, after the heat of the day, to reduce evaporation.\n\n* Take showers instead of baths.\n\nSaving water can reduce your w"
