              "Description": "The Syngas Mfg. Process / Repowering Project has been engineered and designed by a professional engineering company employing good engineering practices, compliance with industry codes and standards, and inclusion of quality assurance and control measures.  The process is commercially available. The installation is in accordance with design specifications. OSHA PSM Standard compliance is being utilized prior to initial startup. COSC (the operator) personnel are being trained based on written procedures pertaining to operations, maintenance, and safety. A PHA has been conducted during the detail engineering phase of the project (July/August 1997) and resolution of action items has been part of the engineering work. The process / system includes safety devices and systems and a LDAR Program.  The facility has a fire protection system. COSC, the operator of the Delaware City Power Plant, has established Safety Procedure Program for its staff and Emergency Response Program.  The facility has long been associated with the New Castle LEPC and DC-CAER agencies concerning emergency response. The facility is located in a commercial zone.  The nearest residential population (five homes) is 1.25 miles north of the site. The nearest environmental  receptor is 0.76 miles north of the site. The nearest industrial facility (public receptor) is about 325 feet north of the process.",
