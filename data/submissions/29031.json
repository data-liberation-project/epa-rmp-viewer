The Fort James Old Town Mill has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment.  This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\n\nThe Fort James Operating Company has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nThe Fort James Old Town Mill plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.  In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at Old Town have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents.  The RMP regulated chemical is chlorine dioxide.\n\nThe Fort James Old Town Mill has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the Risk Management Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G.  The management system is summarized below.\n\nRisk Management Plan"

Emissions from the chlorine dioxide stages of the bleach plant are collected and scrubbed with white liquor in a packed tower scrubber.  Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site and stored as a dilute aqueous solution.  The emissions from this process are also controlled by a packed tower scrubber.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES AND PROCESSES\n\nThe Old Town Mill operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance: chlorine dioxide generation and storage.  This process stores chlorine dioxide solution in a 190,000 gallon storage tank at typical concentrations of 9.5 grams per liter. The maximum concentration (before interlocks) is 11.5 grams per liter. A full storage tank at this concentration is equivalent to 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide. \n\nSince the resulting toxic endpoint distance predicted for the worst-case release of chlorine dioxide potentially encompasses public receptors, and the bleaching process is subject to OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this process is subject to Program 3 requirements. \n \n\nES.3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS AT THE OLD TOWN MILL\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Old Town Mill of Fort James Operating Company has developed and implemented an accidental release prevention program to continuously comply with OSHA\u00bfs 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and EPA\u00bfs 40 CFR Part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention provisions in the Risk Management Program.

That is, the near-field dispersion would be controlled by gravitational slumping caused by the density difference.  EPA's 1996 RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) lists a number of refined dense-gas dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.  Among these models is the DEnse Gas DISpersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1).  DEGADIS, developed by the U.S Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to simulate dispersion of dense-gas releases, is the only dense-gas model included in U.S. EPA\u00bfs Guideline on Air Quality Models (40CFR Parts 51 and 52, Appendix B).  DEGADIS has therefore been used to model the chlorine dioxide worst-case release. \n\nThe modeling was conducted using the prescribed weather conditions of 1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability.  These low dispersion conditions are common at night with fair skies.   No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.  \n\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine dioxide is set by regulation to 1 ppm (0.0028 mg/L).  This is equal to the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) level of 10 ppm, divided by a safety factor of 10 to account for sensitive individuals.  The IDLH, developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is intended to protect healthy workers from irreversible health effects or escape-impairing symptoms for exposures of up to 30 minutes.\n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies \u00bfsurface roughness\u00bf as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume"

The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the facility only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks. The facility explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the safe work practices, and the emergency response procedures. The contractor supervisors are required to train each of their employees who will work on or near a covered process before that employee begins work at the site.

This good record is demonstrated by the lack of any accidental release which had offsite consequences over the past five years and by the decreasing frequency of any kind of accident.\n\n \nES.5 HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the offsite consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors.  Pubic receptors are offsite residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals), commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release.  Environmental receptors are natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments; officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, or areas; and federal wilderness areas, that could be exposed at any time to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoints in the risk management program rule, as a result of an accidental release.\n\nThis section describes the worst-case and alternate scenario consequence analyses.  These analyses comprise the hazard assessment.\n\nES 5.1 Worst-Case Release Scenario Analysis for a Toxic Substance Release\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance at the Old Town Mill is a hypothetical release of the entire contents of a storage tank containing 190,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution.  In accordance with the definition of worst case for toxic gases under RMP regulations, the entire 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide were assumed to be released as a gas cloud from the spilled solution over a ten-minute period.  Based on the structural integrity of the tank and interconnected piping, The Old Town Mill considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in terms of risk management and emergency response planning.

In order to report the most conservative \u00bfdistance to toxic endpoint\u00bf estimates in the Risk Management Plan, Fort James has elected to include only the modeling results obtained assuming \u00bfrural\u00bf surface conditions.  This is reflected in the use of a low 10 cm surface roughness in DEGADIS.\n\nThe modeling indicated a maximum distance of 9.3 miles to chlorine dioxide\u00bfs toxic endpoint of 1 ppm (0.0028 mg/L).  An included file  illustrates the hypothetical 9.3-mile radius. The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 32,500, based on the 2000 Federal Census (Census 2000 TIGER/Line Data).

In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  The EPA OCAG default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere, with dispersion neither enhanced nor limited (D stability and 3 m/sec wind speed).  No mitigation of the release was considered. Because the surface roughness in the immediate vicinity of the Old Town Mill is urban in nature, an urban surface roughness value was utilized in the alternative release modeling. \n\nThe estimated distance to toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles.  A graphical representation of this scenario is included.  The alternative impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 52 persons, based on the 2000 Federal Census (Census 2000 TIGER/Line Data).

The program includes plans and procedures for responding to a wide range of events, caused either naturally or accidentally, which have the potential to result in a release of a regulated substance.  The Old Town Mill emergency response program utilizes the Incident Command System (ICS) which parallels the National Interagency ICS.  This is an \u00bfall risk\u00bf system developed for on-scene management of any emergency event.  The functional design of the ICS minimizes the impact of personnel changes upon the emergency plan.

In addition, the plant has an emergency preparedness program that addresses maintenance, inspection and testing of response equipment as well as instructions and training that govern use of this equipment.\n\nThe overall emergency response program is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  Old Town Mill has around-the-clock communications with the LEPC to ensure notification of the public in event of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response.\n\n\nES.7 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Fort James Operating Company continually strives to improve operations at its facilities in order to reduce the potential of an accidental release to the environment. To that end, the Fort James Operating Company Old Town Mill has replaced the chlorine bleaching system with an elemental chlorine-free system. The new system consists of chlorine dioxide oxidizing bleaching system. This change has resulted in the complete phase out of elemental chlorine from the Old Town Mill. The use of chlorine dioxide greatly reduces the risks of any potential off-site impacts associated with an accidental release, while also reducing the quantity of organically bound halide effluents produced in the bleaching process. The elimination of elemental chlorine in the bleaching process has reduced the worst-case distance to toxic endpoint.  Fort James believes that the conversion to an elemental chlorine-free bleaching process reduces potential risks to its employees, the local communities, and the environment."
