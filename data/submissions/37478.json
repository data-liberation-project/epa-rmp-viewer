      "SummaryText": "The Pride of San Juan facility utilizes pre-startup equipment inspections prior to equipment operations at the site. This includes reviews by certified refrigeration contractors and registered engineers. This pre-startup review is used to determine areas of equipment or operations that may predispose the system to accidental releases.\nA Business Response Plan has been prepared for the facility and will be implemented to include ammonia refrigeration operations. \nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe Pride of San Juan facility is located at 1275 San Justo Road. in San Juan Bautista, California. This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their precooling, cold rooms and process water chilling operations. Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat.  The produce is then stored in a cold storage warehouse.\nThe refrigeration installation for the facility consists of fixed equipment which include screw compressors along with the associated two evaporative condensers and electrical controls high-pressure receiver, low pressure recirculator, ammonia diffusion tank, and fan coils installed in the cold rooms. Chiller units with integral low sides are also included in the refrigeration system. \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nAn offsite consequence analysis for an ammonia release was performed. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nA pre-startup equipment inspection initiates a release prevention program. This procedure, performed at the beginning of the season, insures that the equipment is ready to operate and that all safety items have been reviewed. Both on-site maintenance personnel and certified refrigeration contractors perform ongoing maintenance.\nAdministrative controls limit the amount of ammonia in the system."

Mitigation measures are not considered for every release scenario. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAccording to Pride of San Juan Personnel, since startup there have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia resulting in reportable quantities or injuries.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nPride of San Juan currently has a Business Response Plan in effect that provides emergency contact personnel information, general emergency response procedures, hazardous material release reporting procedures, chemical inventory information, and emergency evacuation procedures. \n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\nAdditional risk reduction measures may be implemented to further reduce the potential for an accidental release. These measures may include installation of upgraded piping and equipment supports, installation of equipment labeling, and implementation of program aimed specifically at the maintenance, training, and emergency response procedures for the ammonia based refrigeration equipment."
