      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Lakeland, Florida facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The warehouse facility is operated by Saddle Creek Corporation, and located at 3010 Saddle Creek Road, Lakeland, (Polk County), Florida. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products packaged in aerosol cans for The Scotts Company, LLC, which is headquartered in Marysville, Ohio. Based on the materials and the processes and results of the offsite consequence analysis discussed below, this plan meets the requirements of Program 1.\n\n\n\nThe aerosol cans are manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son, and consist of consumer product brands Off and Raid.  Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in the aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends.  The maximum potential quantities of aerosol products containing these substances were conservatively based on the forecasted shipments for the facility for 2012.  The maximum product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum potential inventories of each RMP-regulated chemical in the warehouse storage process.  Although the actual amounts in the warehouse at any given time should be much lower, the estimated maximum potential amount of each substance is: \n\n\n\n?    Butane:    286,148 lbs\n\n?    Isobutane:    143,074 lbs\n\n?    Propane:     143,074 lbs\n\n\n\nA worst case scenario was performed using the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and provided software (RMP*Comp) for a vessel with the greatest amount of propellant mixture (maximum 93% by weight).  The maximum quantity of each substance in a single vessel is: 0.68 lbs butane, 0.26 lbs of isobutane, and 0.26 lbs of propane.  The software predicts that the maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this mixture will not extend beyond facility prope"

Note that the RMP*eSubmit program requires that the quantity of each substance be rounded to the nearest pound (1 lbs), and that the impact radius be reported to two significant digits in miles (0.01 mi).  \n\n\n\nNo offsite receptors would be impacted under either scenario.  When not being handled for shipment, all aerosols are stored on pallets within dedicated aerosol cages equipped with additional sprinkler protection and automatic closing doors.  There have been no prior accidents at the facility associated with this process.\n\n\n\nThis process is been incorporated into the facility's emergency response / preparedness plans which have been provided to and coordinated with the Polk County Fire Department.  The emergency plans are reviewed twice annually and updated as needed.  Employees are also provided emergency response training on an annual basis.  \n\n\n\n"
