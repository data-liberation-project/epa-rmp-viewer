      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan\nExecutive Summary\nHP Hood Inc\nWinchester, VA\n\n\nA.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHP Hood Inc (Hood) has recently constructed a new milk processing plant in Winchester, Virginia.  This facility has been designed to include an ammonia refrigeration system to chill product and process areas throughout the manufacturing process.  Hood is committed to operating its new milk processing plant in Winchester, Virginia in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment, Hood has developed and implemented numerous safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  Hood has also developed and implemented a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release were to occur, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to employees, the environment, the surrounding community and the plant.\n\nHood views personnel and environmental protection and accident prevention as a continuous process.  Consequently, Hood continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs throughout its facilities.  A recent addition to the overall accident prevention and response program is the development of its Risk Management Program.  The Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan.  This document represents the Hood RMP plan and provides information about the processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts at the Winchester, VA facility.  Compliance with USEPA's RMP rule includes:\n\n1.\tCompletion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, includi"

      "SummaryText": "ng the five-year accidental release history (no history for this new facility);\n\n2.\tImplementation of an accident prevention program.  The RMP accident prevention program is coordinated with the Process Safety Management (PSM) program which was developed under similar rules administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); and\n\n3.\tImplementation of an emergency response plan.\n\nAdditional information regarding how Hood addresses each of these requirements is provided below and in the attached RMP plan.\n\nThe plant and all equipment is designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  At a minimum, the plant and equipment meet government and industry design and construction standards.\n\n\nB.  RMP Covered Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe new Hood facility in Winchester, VA is owned and operated by HP Hood Inc of Chelsea, MA.  The facility contains an ammonia refrigeration system that chills milk products.  The refrigeration system is new and will be charged with 58,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on June 15, 2000.  This amount exceeds both the PSM and the RMP applicable thresholds.\n\n\nC.  Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, the Hood off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for anhydrous ammonia and an alternative-case release also for anhydrous ammonia.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by USEPA as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in \u00a7 68.22.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.3.  USEPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, USEPA requires worst-case models to be run using the hottest recorded temperature of the past 3 years at night with a very slow, steady wind to minimize the release dispersion."

      "ESSeqNum": 2,
      "FacilityID": 21504,
      "SummaryText": "The models must also assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel, the high-pressure receiver, are completely released at a constant rate over a 10-minute period.\n\nUsing the USEPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case release at the plant (for purposes of RMP) would involve a complete failure of the largest vessel, filled to maximum capacity with ammonia.  If such a release occurred, it would result in a vapor cloud that could impact persons outside the plant's property line.  The probability of a receiver releasing its entire contents in 10 minutes in Winchester, VA on a 102\u00b0 F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely low for numerous obvious reasons.\n\nHood also developed an alternative release scenario that considers more a realistic situation occurring during more common meteorological conditions as part of the RMP standard.  USEPA requires that the modeling of this type of release be shown to reach off-site locations.  After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, Hood used a liquid release due to a forklift accident for its alternative-case scenario.\n\n\nD.  Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nHood has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.  The program complies with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and is analogous to RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  To comply with RMP, the facility has taken its PSM program and incorporated an additional focus - protection of the public.\n\nThe basic elements of the Hood's prevention program are described below:\n\n1.  Employee Participation.  Hood has developed and implemented a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (a) consulted and what input they will have in the de"

Process Safety Information.  Hood has compiled written process safety information that helped identify the hazards posed by ammonia, handling of materials, management, storage activities and the refrigeration system in general.  The compilation of process safety information provided the foundation for understanding the hazards involved in the ammonia refrigeration system and was crucial to the development of the PHA (discussed in subsection 3 immediately below).  The required process safety information includes information pertaining to anhydrous ammonia, the technology of the ammonia refrigeration system, and the process equipment.  See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.119(d).\n\nInformation pertaining to the technology of the ammonia refrigeration system includes: (1) block flow diagrams; (2) process chemistry; (3) maximum intended inventory; (4) safe upper and lower limits for temperature, pressure, flow and composition; and (5) an evaluation of the consequences of deviations, including those affecting the safety and health of employees and the nearby public.\n\nEquipment information includes: (1) materials of construction; (2) piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs); (3) electrical classification; (4) relief system design and design basis; (5) ventilation system design; (6) design codes and standards employed; and (7) material and energy balances for processes built as part of the recent expansion.\n\n3.  Process Hazard Analyses.  Hood recently performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) on the refrigeration system.  The PHA is a key component of the Hood's PSM system and RMP accident prevention program.  It provided a thorough, orderly, and systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and controlling hazards posed by the ammonia refrigeration process.  The PHA utilized methodologies in accordance with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.119(e) and 4"

An incident investigation team is established and consists of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including contractor's employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.\n\n12. Emergency Planning and Response.  Hood has developed an emergency response plan that satisfies applicable state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning requirements.\n\n13. Compliance Audits.  Hood will evaluate the facility's compliance with PSM and RMP standards at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices it has developed are adequate and being followed.

Five Year Accident History\n\nHood is a new facility and therefore has never experienced a RMP reportable release.\n\n\nF.  Emergency Response Procedures and Policies\n\nThe training programs at Hood comply with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1910.120(q)(2)(ii) (emergency response), 1910.156 (portable fire extinguishers),1910.1200(h) (hazard communication), and 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 112.7(e)(10) (Oil SPCC).  All employees receive basic emergency response training appropriate to their response responsibilities.  Those employees that work with hazardous materials or could come into contact with them are given specific training, depending on their duties, on the proper handling of hazardous substances and notification procedures in the event of a release.  For example, where appropriate, Hood employees are trained on: safe work practices; security procedures; appropriate use, inspection and maintenance of personal protection equipment and the location thereof; chemical and oil loading and unloading procedures; internal and external reporting procedures; facility evacuation procedures; confined space entry, lock-out tag-out procedures, and area maintenance and housekeeping.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant will depend on the Winchester Police and Fire Departments for outside support depending on the severity of the release.  If additional assistance is determined to be needed, they will contact other local and state emergency response teams.\n\n\nG.  Planned Changes\n\nHood has recently completely construction of the plant.  Future changes in the form of an expansion are currently planned for the end of 2001.  These changes, as currently planned, would require an increase of ammonia to the refrigeration system, but would not be enough to trigger a RMP resubmittal."
