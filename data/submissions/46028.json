Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review.  \r\n\r\nAlbertsons LLC is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the San Leandro distribution center. Facility management is involved in the design, operation , and maintenance of the system. Albertson?s employees have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.
