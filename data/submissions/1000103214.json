Finally, an emergency shutdown system was installed.    \n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE SCENARIOS\nComputer air models were developed based on a worst case release scenario involving the catastrophic structural failure of the system receiver. The receiver can potentially contain the largest quantity of ammonia in a single vessel at this facility. The worst case scenario is considered to be the total capacity of ammonia in the refrigeration system's high pressure receiver, including the amount of ammonia that could drain back from the condensers and piping, or the high temperature re-circulator.  The worst-case and alternate-case models were produced using Marplot.  The toxic endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThis facility has developed a prevention program which complies with the requirements of OSHA CFR 29, 1910.119 Process Safety Management and EPA 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Plan. This program includes procedures, training, and proactive maintenance measures to keep the system operating without catastrophic release.\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility calls for the immediate evacuation or shelter in place as determined necessary for the particular event. The Lafayette Fire Department would be the HAZMAT responder. The local fire department has been included in the notification and action plan. Guidry Catfish personnel are trained to assist the responders with information only, and would not participate in actual response if it required Level A suits.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no incidents meeting the definition of an accident at this facility in the last 5 years."

      "SummaryText": "STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe stationary source is defined as Guidry's Catfish facility located at 1093 Henderson Highway, Breaux Bridge, LA.\nGuidry's Catfish processes & distributes seafood products.  The facility has one refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia, C.A.S. #7664-41-7. Ammonia is the only regulated substance used at this facility. The Ammonia Refrigeration System contains approximately 14,800 pounds of ammonia.  The facility exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls. Engineering controls include automated component shutdowns when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel. The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels. Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant to the atmosphere.   As required by the EPA Regulation, it is required to update the RMP every 5 years.  The RMP is being updated today (December 22, 2022).  Since the first RMP in 2017, there have been a number of safety improvements.  One improvement is an ammonia detection system was purchased and installed.  Second, a calculation using the ANSI/IIAR 2 revised standard was completed for determining the correct pressure relief valves where required and the correct pressure relief vent system.  After the calculation was complete, all existing pressure relief valves were replaced based on the new standard design and connected to a new pressure relief valve vent system.  The regulation requires that the pressure relief valves be replaced every 5 years.  The facility is in the process of ordering new pressure relief valves for replacement in March 2023.  Another improvement was the installation of a property fence and c"
