The RMP rule requires a facility to report the unit \r\ninventory for each RMP substance that exceeds threshold quantities, along with an EPA \r\napproved chemical release prevention program.  In addition, 40 CFR 68 requires all RMP \r\ncovered facilities to update its Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) every five (5) years or six (6) \r\nmonths after an RMP reportable incident.
