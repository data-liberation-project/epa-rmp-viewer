THE FACILITY POLICY\n\nTHE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF HARVESTLAND COOPERATIVE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIROMENT.\n\n2. HARVESTLAND COOPERATIVES INFORMATION.\n\n -THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE SOLD TO FARMERS AND HARVEST LAND CUSTOMERS.\n\n- ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, AND STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR THE DIRECT APPLICATION FOR CROP PRODUCTION IN THE AREA.\n\n- PROPANE IS STORED AND DISTRIBUTED TO THE FARMERS AND TO CUSTOMERS FOR HOME HEATING AND FOR DRYING CORN.\n\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHDROUS THAT CAN BE STORED AT OUR FACILITY IS 228,000 POUNDS IN OUR SUPPLY TANK AND RUNNING STOCK. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PROPANE THAT CAN BE STORED IN THE SUPPLY TANK IS 120,000 POUNDS OF PRODUCT,\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\na. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE AMMONIA STORAGE TANK AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 130,OOO POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR PROPANE WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE PROPANE STORAGE TANK AS A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION  WOULD BE 75,800 POUNDS, BASED ON 85% CAPACITY. THE ENDPOINT FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS 1.12 MILES AND THE ENDPOINT FOR PROPANE IS .43 MILES.\n\nb. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR AMMONIA, BASED ON A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM THE BREAK OF A THREE INCH PIPE GIVES AND ENDPOINT OF .78 MILES. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE FOR PROPANE IS A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION WITH AN ENDPOI"
