This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n The Morgan's Point Complex located in Harris County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, L L C. and is operated by Enterprise.  \n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex is a hydrocarbon storage and terminal facility capable of receiving, storing and shipping flammable hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures.  The facility currently handles a flammable isobutane product, a flammable isobutylene product, a flammable ethane product, and a flammable natural gasoline product.  Liquids are primarily received at the facility via pipeline and barge, but can also be received by rail tank car or tanker truck delivery.  Received liquids are stored in above ground storage tanks pending sale or shipment.  Liquids are shipped out of the terminal via pipeline, barge, ship, rail tank car and tanker trucks.  \n\nFor the ethane export facility dehydration is carried out in solid desiccant dehydrators to remove trace amounts water from the ethane products so that this water will not freeze when the product is refrigerated prior to loading. The dehydrators use vaporized ethane for regeneration.  The dehydrators have pre and post-filtering of the ethane product being loaded. Following dehydr"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on operating knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Morgan's Point Complex are a flammable isobutane product, a flammable ethane product and propylene which is used as a refrigerant in the ethane export terminal.  Crude oil and natural gasoline is also received and stored at the facility, but is exempt from the RMP regulation. Isobutane storage at the facility is classified as storage incident to transportation and not subject to the RMP regulation.  Isobutylene passes through the facility in a DOT jurisdictional pipeline but is not present in threshold quantities.  \n\nThe storage and terminal operations are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and are classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Morgan's Point Complex.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEnterprise strongly pro"

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, a \"near-miss\" reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\n\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nEnterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\n\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are "

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Morgan's Point Complex has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on any changes as part of the change management process.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit of the program to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to operations or facility management for resolution.  The final resolution of each finding is documented,"

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at the Morgan's Point Complex.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n \n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n* Fire detectors and alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature).\n\n* Curbs or dikes to contain liquid releases\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps, where feasible.\n\nAtmospheric relief devices \n\n* Total Plant emergency shutdown (ESD) system.\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers \n\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nOver the past five years there have been no large or small r"

The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Morgan's Point Complex is coordinated with the Harris County - LaPorte Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Morgan's Point Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Morgan's Point Complex conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.  The facility is also a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) cooperative industry emergency response organization to provide for a potentially large number of emergency responders, if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety "
