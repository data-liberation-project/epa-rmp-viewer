The emergency action plan (EAP) as outlined by 29 CFR 1910.38.  This policy addresses employee evacuation and external response.  The spill prevention control and countermeasures (SPCC) policy as outlined by 40 CFR Part 112.  This policy addresses the prevention of Spills and Emergency Actions resulting from spills.  The third policy is the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  This policy outlines the implemented controls based from a formal Risk based analysis of Stockmeier's processes.\n\n\n\n2)    Stockmeier Urethanes serves customers primarily in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets (CASE).  Several of our products contain 2,4 Toluene Diisocyanate and 2,6 Toluene Diisocyante (TDI 80/20).  This is the material of interest for the Risk Management Plan as it meets the threshold for RMP consideration.  TDI 80/20 is used as a reactive ingredient during the urethane prepolymer manufacture process. The TDI 80/20 is stored in an 8,000 gallon storage tank located inside an enclosed secondary containment. When needed the product is pumped into a reactor for urethane prepolymer manufacture.\n\n\n\n3)    The release scenarios at the site include:\n\n\n\na.    Worst Case Scenario 1: Failure of a bulk tanker (spill and vaporization) involving the TDI 80/20 during a tanker unloading and transfer to the bulk storage tank. A detailed unloading checklist is followed and all unloading is monitored by the operator.  The system interlocked as well to provide a High Alarm as a warning and High, High Interlockin"

      "SummaryText": "g system shutdown logic.  The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 miles.\n\n\n\nb.    Alternate Case Scenario 1: This scenario involves the potential for a line break or leak during transfer. It is estimated that only 120 lbs of material would be released.  The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 miles. \n\n\n\nc.    Engineered controls include a local shut down E-Stop at the unload ramp.  Administrative controls include: procedural check list that includes a visual inspection of the equipment, QC lab interface prior to ensure the proper tank and QC approval prior to unload, Supervisor interface calculating expected tank level prior to unload commencement, and Supervisor Radio verify tank level during the unload.  \n\n\n\n4)    This site has a Risk Management Plan.  Some of the key elements of this plan include: Engineering design \"alarms and interlock systems\", Containment for spills, Liquid level Indication, and tank sizing criteria to ensure no partial unloads.    Administrative elements include:  unload procedural checklist, visual inspections of equipment, training, and inspections. \n\n\n\n5)    No releases of the TDI system have occurred in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n6)    Site has communicated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), local emergency services, and the state environmental protection agency.  The spill response plan includes emergency protocol which includes communication with all emergency personnel in the event of an emergency.  \n\n\n\n7)    Planned changes to improve safety include:  Generate a call list of local industry and add these contacts to the existing communication protocol in the event of an emergency.   Notify the same local industries that we have added them to our emergency communications protocol.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nRocky Romine\n\nDirectory of Operations & EHS\n\nStockmeier Urethanes USA, Inc.\n\nJune 23, 2016"
