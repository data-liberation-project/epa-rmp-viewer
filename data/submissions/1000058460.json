The distance to endpoint for this scenario is 0.1 miles. \r\n\r\nc.\tEngineered controls include a local shut down E-Stop at the unload ramp.  Administrative controls include: procedural check list that includes a visual inspection of the equipment, QC lab interface prior to ensure the proper tank and QC approval prior to unload, Supervisor interface calculating expected tank level prior to unload commencement, and Supervisor Radio verify tank level during the unload.  \r\n\r\n4)\tThis site has a Risk Management Plan.  Some of the key elements of this plan include: Engineering design alarms and interlock systems, Containment for spills, Liquid level Indication, and tank sizing criteria to ensure no partial unloads.    Administrative elements include:  unload procedural checklist, visual inspections of equipment, training, and inspections. \r\n\r\n5)\tNo releases of the TDI system have occurred in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n6)\tSite has communicated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), local emergency services, and the state environmental protection agency.

The emergency action plan (EAP) as outlined by 29 CFR 1910.38.  This policy addresses employee evacuation and external response.  The spill prevention control and countermeasures (SPCC) policy as outlined by 40 CFR Part 112.  This policy addresses the prevention of Spills and Emergency Actions resulting from spills.  The third policy is the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  This policy outlines the implemented controls based from a formal Risk based analysis of Stockmeier's processes.\r\n\r\n2)\tStockmeier Urethanes serves customers primarily in the coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers markets (CASE).  Several of our products contain 2,4 Toluene Diisocyanate and 2,6 Toluene Diisocyante (TDI 80/20).  This is the material of interest for the Risk Management Plan as it meets the threshold for RMP consideration.  TDI 80/20 is used as a reactive ingredient during the urethane prepolymer manufacture process. The TDI 80/20 is stored in an 8,000 gallon storage tank located inside an enclosed secondary containment. When needed the product is pumped into a reactor for urethane prepolymer manufacture.\r\n\r\n3)\tThe release scenarios at the site include:\r\n\r\na.\tWorst Case Scenario 1: Failure of a bulk tanker (spill and vaporization) involving the TDI 80/20 during a tanker unloading and transfer to the bulk storage tank. A detailed unloading checklist is followed and all unloading is monitored by the operator.  The system interlocked as well to provide a High Alarm as a warning and High, High Interlockin"
