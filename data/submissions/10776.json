This is to say that it will be viewed as a worse case and appropriate personnel will be properly suited with the necessary protection equipment to handle the release. These individual have had Pulmonary testing and have gone through SCBA training.                                                                                                                                             The safety program consists of all facets of loss prevention which will include, but is not limited to providing safety training and education; conducting accident investigations and plant inspections; development and enforcemant of safety rules and regulations; maintenance of facilities and equipment in both a sanitary and safe working condition; prvide fire protection and security systems;and the communication of our safety program to all employees.                                                                                     Supervalu/ Lewis Grocery is a wholesale grocery warehouse. it supplies grocery and perishable items to independant and food chain stores. The refrigeration of the perishable items is done with ammonia. The ammonia is circulated through iro pipes by compressors, pumps, evaporators, and condensors(cooling towers). The condensors are located on the roof above the mechanical room which house the compressors, pumps, and receiver.                                                                                                                                                        OCA guidance was used as the basis for these scenarios. Results for the worst case scenario of an ammonia release indicates that 9900 lbs. of ammonia would be released in a 10 minute duration at a rate of 545 lbs./ minute. This would be released inside the building with opening to the outside atmosphere. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.4 miles with a wind speed of 3.4 miles"
