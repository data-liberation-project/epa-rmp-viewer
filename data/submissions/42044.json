      "SummaryText": "GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n1.    CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ? Chlorine is one of the chemical elements, neither the gas nor the liquid is explosive or flammable; both react chemically with many substances. Chlorine is only slightly soluble in water. The gas has a  characteristic odor and greenish yellow color and is about two and one half times as heavy as air. Thus, if it escapes from the container or system, it will seek the lowest level in the building or area in which the leak occurs. Liquid chlorine is clear, amber in color and is about one and one half times as heavy as water. At atmospheric pressure, it boils at about -30?F and freezes at about - 150?F. One volume of liquid chlorine, when vaporized, will yield about 460 volumes of gas. Although dry chlorine does not react with (corrodes) many metals, it is very reactive (strongly corrosive) when moisture also is present.\n\n2.    SATURATED CHLORINE GAS ? Chlorine gas in such condition that the removal of any heat will cause some portion of it to condense to a liquid.\n\n3.    SATURATED CHLORINE LIQUID ? Chlorine liquid in such condition that the addition of any heat will cause some portion of the chlorine to vaporize to gas.\n\n4.    USE OF WATER ? Never use water on a chlorine leak. Chlorine is only slightly soluble in water; also, the corrosive action of chlorine and water always will make a leak worse.\n\n5.    BUILDING ? Any building to house chlorine equipment or containers should be designed and constructed to protect all elements of the chlorine system from fire hazards.\n\n    NOTE:  Flammable materials should never be stored in the same building.\n\n    At least two (2) means of exits should be provided from each room, sulfur dioxide or chlorine or the building storing these chemicals that are handled or used. All exit doors should open outward.\n\n6.    VENTILATION ? The building ventilation system should provide fresh air for normal operation and should take into consideration the possibility of a leak. In some cases, natural ventilati"

      "FacilityID": 42044,
      "SummaryText": "on may be adequate; in others, ventilation by means of a suitable exhaust fan should be provided. A one (1) minute to four (4) minute air exchange is desirable.\n    \n    NOTE:  Precaution must be taken to avoid discharging chlorine where it can cause damage or injury.\n\n7.    EMERGENCY KITS ? Emergency kits have been designed to contain most leaks, which may be encountered in chlorine or sulfur dioxide shipping containers. These kits operate on the principle of capping off leaking valves, or in the case of cylinders and ton containers, of sealing off a leak in the side wall. Capping devices are provided  for fusible plugs in ton containers. Many chlorine consumers incorporate in their emergency plan provisions for the use of these kits. The kits contains step by step instructions for the use of these devices. All necessary tools are included.\n\n    NOTE:  Gas masks, personal protective clothing are not included in the emergency repair kits.\n\n    NOTE:  To prevent possible personal injury, the City has made available approved gas masks and chemical resistance suit for emergency situations.\n\n    NOTE:  Emergency Kit ?B? is required for repair on one (1) ton cylinders.\n\n8.    HEALTH HAZARDS ? Chlorine gas is primary a respiratory irritant. In sufficient concentrations, the gas irritates the mucous membranes, the respiratory system and the skin. In extreme cases, difficulty in breathing may increase to the point where death can occur from suffocation. The characteristic, penetrating odor of chlorine gas usually gives warning of its presence in the air. Its greenish yellow color makes it visible at high concentrations, liquid chlorine in contact with skin or eyes will cause burns."
