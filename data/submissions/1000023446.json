The December 2011 Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\nupdate was developed in accordance with the requirements specified under 40 CFR Part 68. The plan\n\ncertified that Cargill Corn Milling Division has instituted a RMP at the Cedar Rapids, Iowa facility.\n\n\n\nThe only covered process and regulated substance on-site is Propylene Oxide (PO) which is stored in an\n\nunderground storage tank. Only the accidental release of PO is included in this December 2011 update\n\nto the RMP. Because the PO is contained in a underground storage tank the worst case analysis was\n\nconducted by analyzing a release from a filling line connected to the PO tank rather than the entire contents\n\nof the tank being released.\n\n\n\nCargill's policy is to conduct all business activities in a manner that protects the environment and the health\n\nand safety of our employees, contractors, customers and the public.\n\n\n\nEnvironment.
