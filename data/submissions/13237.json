Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n1.5   Five-year Accident History\n\nCominco American, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been only one small accidental release during this period.  \n\nOn May 12, 1997 at 2:15 PM, approximately 12 pounds sulfur dioxide leaked during an above ground fill/transfer operation due to incompatibility of seating materials of the pressure relief valves (PRV).  The transfer/fill operation was stopped and then reversed.  The safety officer created an evacuation zone.  Took readings to determine air quality.  The sensidyne tube readings were 1-5 ppm before the reverse fill; when completed no readings were found.\n\nThe HazMat specialist confirmed that there was no damage to report.  The PRVs were replaced on the tanks under the supervision of the Health HazMat supervision.\n\nThis resulted in Cominco American changing its policy regarding the replacement of PRV valves.  These valves will be changed during the annual DOT inspections, i.e. external visual and Leak Test.\n\n1.6   Emergency Response Plan\n\nCominco American, Inc. and its operator, Accu Chem Conversion, Inc. has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.

Some of the major steps we have taken to improve safety at our facility:  Replacement of pressure relief valves (PRV) during the regular annual DOT Inspections, i.e. external visual and Leak Test.  The procedure for hydrostatically testing liquid product transfer hoses was revised on January 29, 1999 to replace all product hoses after one calendar year of use.  The installation of a windsock to facilitate personnel to escape during an emergency.  These changes have been implemented.\n\n1.8  Y2K Readiness Disclosure\n\nCominco American, Inc. and its operator, Accu Chem Conversion, Inc. has identified Year 2000 impacts, and has evaluated those issues.  We have worked with our suppliers of software, hardware and infrastructure to obtain their plans and schedules for Year 2000-compliant versions of their products.\n\nWe have installed new, state-of-the-art Year 2000-compliant systems.  We are also working with our venders, banks and other critical contacts to ensure that they are prepared for what changes are involved in moving into the 21st century and beyond.\n\nSafety and the environment will be protected due to the rigid testing and certification processes with which we're working and our Sulfur Dioxide Transload Facility will continue operating without interruption or incident."

This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Los Angeles County Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control, and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nOur Landlord, Admiral Transportation, Inc., also located at 300 N. Baldwin Park Blvd., City of  Industry, California, is aware of the sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) transload operation.  During actual transfers, Admiral Transportation, Inc. conducts none of their business activities on the back dock area, and the warehouse door at the rear of their #3 Building is closed.  In the event of a release of sulfur dioxide, they have been advised to call 911 immediately. Mr. Carl E.

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n1.3.1 The Worst Case Release Scenario \n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario submitted for Program 2 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Railcar Transloading/Transfer.  The scenario involves the release of 300,000 pounds of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as automatic shut-off valves are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters/second (3.4 miles/hour) wind speed, the maximum distance of 19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/L.\n\n1.3.2  Alternative Release Scenario\n\nAn alternative release scenario has been submitted for the toxic substance present in Program 2.  The alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Railcar-to-tanker truck transloading.  There is no warehouse storage in the Railcar Transloading/Transfer process.  The scenario involves the release of 300 pounds of Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) in a gaseous form over 120 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as automatic shut-off valves are taken into account to calculate the scenario.   Active mitigation measures that included emergency shutd"
