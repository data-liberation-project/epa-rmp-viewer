We grow, pack, ship and sell table grapes, raisins, etc. \n\nRegulated Substance: \nThe only toxic substance we handle above the federal threshold levels is Sulfur Dioxide (Anhydrous). Sulfur Dioxide is used to bleach the raisins.  It has a strong 'rotten egg\" odor and is easily detected by the human nose.  We use this chemical during post-harvest (for approximately 60 days per year) and then return it to the supplier when the season is over.\n\n\nSafety Features:  \nThe metal tanks that store the sulfur dioxide (1-ton cylinders) have recessed valves which protected against accidental damage to the valves.  We have trained personnel who are responsible for the application and have many years of experience working with this chemical.   The tanks have 3 fusible plugs built into them to protect against pressure build up during a fire.  Sulfur dioxide is not considered a fire hazard.\n\nAccident History:  \nThere have been no reported accidents related to sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) reported in the last 5 years.\n \n\nWorst-Case Scenario:\nWhen utilizing the EPA provided RMP COMP modeling software for the worst case scenario, the distance calculated to the toxic endpoint was 1.3 miles.  \n\n\nAlternative-Case Scenario:\nThe EPA modeling software for the alternative-case scenario calculated the distance to toxic endpoint at 0.3 miles.  \n\n\nEmergency Response:\nThe First Responders for this dehydrator would be the North Central Fire Protection District.  \n\n\nPlanned changes:  \nOn August 24, 1999, we completed training with video's, MSDS, and other materials provided to us by our our sulfur dioxide supplier (Snowden).    We are in the process of scheduled a updated fire department inspection for this facility.  We have a security guard on duty during non working hours.  We are planning to work on a joint practice drill with the fire department, security personnel, and other required personnel to han"
