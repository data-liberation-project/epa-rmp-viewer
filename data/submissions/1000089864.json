The site occupies approximately 2.8 Acres and will employ 21 Evonik, BASF and contract personnel.  The unit is designed, built and managed by BASF.  Startup is scheduled for August-September, 2015 when the unit will produce a chelate, methylglycinediacetic acid, for use as an additive in commercial and consumer cleaning products.  The unit is located on leased property within Evonik Corporation's Mobile Site.  Personnel, site services, some raw materials and utilities will be supplied by Evonik under various contractual arrangements.  The Trilon Unit will adhere to Evonik environmental, safety and health policies and procedures.  In addition selected BASF procedures will also be in effect.\n\n\n\nRMP applicable chemicals utilized include Formaldehyde Solution, Anhydrous Ammonia and Hydrocyanic Acid.  Hydrocyanic acid is present in small quantities well below the applicable threshold for HCN.  HCN is not stored and is reacted to an intermediate without accumulation.  Anydrous Ammonia, a recovered by-product, is present in quantities less than than the the RMP threshold quantity.  As a conservative measure, however, Anydrous Ammonia is included in the RMP plan.  Formaldehyde solution is stored in quantities which exceed the RMP threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nAS the BASF plant is located within the Evonik facility, the BASF unit will rely on the Evonik Emergency Response capabilities.   Evonik began production as Degussa and now produces a variety of intermediates/products for it's various business units. Approximately 1,100 Evonik and contract personnel are employed.  The site maintains fully developed environmental, safety and industrial "

Emergency response planning, training and resources are provided by Evonik which maintains several RMP plans for their various processes.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION for the EVONIK, BASF and all 3rd Party Facilities\n\nThe Evonik program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including\n\nthe possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The\n\nprocedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid, medical treatment,\n\nevacuation plans, and notification of local emergency response.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Evonik is coordinated with the Mobile Fire\n\nDepartment and the Emergency Management Agency (EMA). This coordination includes periodic\n\nmeetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government\n\nofficials, and industry representatives. Evonik has around-the-clock communications capability with\n\nappropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This\n\nprovides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick\n\nresponse to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Evonik conducts periodic\n\nemergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the plant\n\nprovides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated\n\nsubstances in the plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
