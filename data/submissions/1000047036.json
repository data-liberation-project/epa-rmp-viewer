This is accomplished to a great extent by a well- developed, up-to-date and implemented of the RMP program, level 3.  All USCS facilities shall operate in a prudent and safe manner.  It shall be the responsibility of the plant manager to ensure that all procedures are followed as set forth in our RMP program.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release it is USCS policy to immediately call the National Response Center, Local Emergency Response Committee, the local Fire Department and other agency(ies) that may be required.  All USCS facilities will have an emergency response team to assist these agency(ies).\r\nUnited State Cold Storage, Dallas,Cockrell Hill is a public refrigerated warehouse that uses anhydrous ammonia and Carbon Dioxide as a refrigerant in a closed loop system.  Anhydrous ammonia, mostly commonly known as ammonia, is an excellent refrigerant and is commonly used in most of the world's industrial refrigeration systems.  Ammonia has an excellent warning property, its odor.  Ammonia's odor is familiar to most people due to the fact that it is commonly used in household cleaning solutions.  Ammonia can be detected as low as 5 parts per million (PPM) and has an average life span of 7 days in the environment before it breaks down to its common elements nitrogen and hydrogen.\r\nTypical items stored within USCS facilities are raw or processed food items that can be found in your supermarket or local restaurant.  Temperatures range between -20 degrees to +45 degrees F.  The refrigeration equipment and piping are located throughout the facility.  There are a few exceptions, the condensers and related piping are on the machine room roof.  The machine room contains all of the large refrigeration machinery and vessels.  The facility is equipped with ammonia detectors and Carbon Dioxide dector"

All of USCS facilities are maintained by a staff of trained maintenance personnel.  Most of these people are members of the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA) and all Chief Engineers are members of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and hold a RETA Certification Level A.  USCS has on staff at the corporate level an Regulatory Compliance and Safety Manager who is a Certified Safety professional(CSP).  All facilities comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management without regard to the ammonia threshold quantity.  All the vessels and piping have been installed according to ASME vessel and piping codes and applicable local Building, Fire and Mechanical Codes.\r\n\r\nThe USCS Dallas, Cockrell Hill started operations in August 2013.  The facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for 29CFR 1910.38 - Emergency Action Plan.  OSHA's 1910.119, Process Safety Management and 1910.120 HAZWOPER standards.  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nThe Facility's PHA was recently revalidated and produced 10 recommendations to improve safety.  The following administrative controls are in place:  Engine room log is maintained with visual checks of all of the equipment including the ammonia pumps.  Oil that is added to the refrigeration equipment is noted on the Daily Engine Room Log.  Annual preventive maintenance of the refrigeration equipment includes the ammonia pumps.  Housekeeping of the engine room area includes wiping up and investigating oil leaks and mopping of the engine room floor on a daily to weekly bases. \r\n\r\nThis Facility just recently had an expansion and has increased the amount of ammonia stored on site to above the threshold quantity."
