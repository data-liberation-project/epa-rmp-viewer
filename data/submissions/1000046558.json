Magnablend complies with applicable federal, state and local regulations.  All Magnablend employees are informed of hazards in the workplace and are trained accordingly.  Magnablend has procedures in place to safely remove employees from the plant in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nMagnablend manufactures specialty chemical products for its customers utilizing customer formulations and specifications.  Magnablend specializes in oil field chemicals, agricultural fertilizers, construction chemicals, water treating chemicals, and industrial cleaning compounds.  Anhydrous ammonia is utilized as a raw material in many of the products as a source of nitrogen and pH control.  Hydrofluoric Acid is intermediately produced in the production of ProFlow, but constitutes only 3.8% of that product when it is shipped to the end user.   Hydrofluoric Acid is not stored in any quantity at the facility, but is present at it's covered process threshold quantity only momentarily during production of ProFlow.   \n\n\n\n3. Worst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nPlease reference onsite data (Volume 1: Risk Management Plan) at Magnablend's liquid facility.\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nMagnablend, Inc. complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) standard relative to anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, this facility has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia storage and piping systems.   All operators associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia have been trained and are knowledgeab"
