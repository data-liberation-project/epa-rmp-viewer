These\nregulations mandate the investigation of potential accident scenarios which could effect\nthe surrounding population and environment as determined by published EPA\nregulations, guidelines and guidance materials. The scenarios prescribed for investigation\ninclude both a worst-case and an alternative release which could possible occur at the\nSoutheastern Adhesives (SEACO) facilities.\n\na)SEACO, under its present Senior Management, has adopted a pro-active approach to\nchemical safety by instituting a chemical accidental release policy governing all\nchemicals present at our stationary sources. This policy addresses the safe handling and\nstorage of all process chemicals and products, as well as, chemicals used in the day to\nday operations of our facility and allows for the monitoring of safe practices, procedures\nand conditions with daily visual inspections of all process and storage areas. If an\nemergency situation should ever occur, SEACO's emergency response plan would be\ninitiated. Designated, trained response teams and individuals would proceed with\nappropriate actions which are spelled out in the emergency plan, thus ensuring the safety\nof its employees, surrounding neighbors, and environment. \n\nBoth SEACO's \"Accidental Release Plan\" and \"Emergency Response Plan\" are contained\nin its general Programs and Policies Manual.\n \nb) SEACO owns and operates two stationary sources which are required to submit Risk\nManagement Plans to the EPA, they are similar in process:\n                                       1)   SEACO\n                                             815-D Virginia St., SW"

This scenario is unlikely as the\nreaction process is constantly monitored by trained, experienced personnel during the\ncritical stages.  A run-away reaction would not result in the release of 100% of the 50%\nformaldehyde solution charged to the reaction. The reaction of formaldehyde with urea\nproduces a large amount of heat and causes the acidity of the reaction mixture to increase\n(lower pH). Both the heat and the lower pH add to the instability of the reaction.\nTherefore, as the reaction proceeds and more formaldehyde reacts with urea, the process\nbecomes more unstable and the possibility of a runaway reaction increases but the\navailability of unreacted formaldehyde decreases.  It is also unlikely that all the reaction\nmixture would escape from the large vessel through its relatively small (24 inch) mouth,\nas the reaction vessel is never intentionally filled to capacity. The exact amount of\nunreacted formaldehyde released is impossible to determine; therefore, based upon\nreaction kinetics, vessel size and experience, a quantity of half (50% x 20,000lbs) of the\n(50%) formaldehyde/water solution charged to the reaction was used to conduct\ncalculations as this would be a generous estimate of a formaldehyde released from such a\nrunaway"

Chem-specific guidelines address proper training,\nhandling and storage methods prescribed by OSHA, EPA, and other industry specific\nagencies.  Inspections and monitoring of all formaldehyde transfer and delivery into\nstorage and process reaction vessels, weight differential transfer systems for raw material\ndelivery to reaction vessel, manual shut-offs of piping delivery,  etc., equipment\ninspection, maintenance and daily visual inspections of on-site storage, processes,\nequipment and overall conditions helps to ensure the early detection of any accidental\nrelease at this SEACO facility.\n\n\ne) A review of accidental releases over the past five (5) years reveals that SEACO-\nLenoir, NC has had no accidental releases resulting in deaths, injuries and damage to on-\nsite, off-site, public or environmental receptors (40 CFR 68.42).  However, in late\nAugust of 1997 a complaint of an unpleasant odor originating at our facility was filed. \nInvestigation by on-site personnel, commercial tank emissions testing and estimates, and\nstate investigation by NCDEHNR personnel revealed no leak or spill and total\ncompliance with all standards and regulations for emissions, etc.. It was determined that\nthe \"odor\" was produced during a storage tank cleaning procedure. SEACO conducted a\nreview of these procedures and adopted improved cleaning methods to reduce emissions\nduring tank cleaning.  No evacuation / emergency procedures were instituted as a result\nof this incident.  \n\nf)  In detail, SEACO's \"Emergency Response Program\" contains pertinent information\ndealing with the procedures to follow if an emergency situation should present itself.\nThe program covers in-house emergency response procedures and designated responders\nand their duties, emergency action procedures, pertinent phone numbers of responsible\ncompany personnel and community emergency responders, next of kin notification\ninformation, a"
