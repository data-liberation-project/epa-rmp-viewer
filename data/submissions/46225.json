      "SummaryText": "Rialto Regional Distribution Center\nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Rialto facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is located at 305 West Resource Drive in Rialto, (San Bernardino County) California. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products, packaged in aerosol cans, manufactured by the site owner,  Unilever. The operator at the site is Exel, Inc. a subsidiary of Deutche Post Ag, Bonn, Germany. \n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations. Specifically the components consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends. The maximum projected quantities (cases) of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and product propellant weights were used to estimate the maximum quantities of RMP- regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process. \n\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on EPA's Consequence Analysis Guidelines indicates that the distance to the 1psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond warehouse property. No offsite receptors are impacted. There have also not been any prior accidents at the facility resulting in any offsite environmental impacts. The Rialto site is participating in CERT  training sponsered by San Bernardino County on 6-6-06 to continue the process of coordinating emergency response activities with the local government."
