Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the facility's closed-loop refrigeration systems. The system provides process and warehouse cooling for raw materials and the chilled juice packaging operation. The refrigeration system contains more than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia for RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps CCNA is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent in our accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. In addition to complying with the RMP Rule, the facility also complies with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (PSM) Standard. The PSM Program serves as the RMP Prevention Plan. This includes the required prevention elements such as written operating procedures, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigations, and compliance audits. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. Such controls include ammonia detectors with alarms and interlocks, safety relief valves, level indicators, high-pressure shutdowns, and other safety instrumented systems. However, if such an accidental release does occur, CCNA has coordinated with the Paw Paw Fire Department and the Van Buren County LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated"

      "SummaryText": " hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  See supporting letter the details the worst and alternate case release scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CCNA facility at Paw Paw has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in an offsite consequence in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe CCNA facility may have had nuisance odors that caused an incident investigation but not over the reportable quantity.  \n\n\n\n\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CCNA written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency and complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. The Plan documents specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases. Containment and mitigation of a release will be accomplished by qualified, offsite contract personnel. Local emergency response agencies will perform rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment and other response functions only after a release has been stopped and it is safe to enter the premises. The plan is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that require modified procedures. The Emergency Response Plan is coordinated with the Van Buren County LEPC. The Paw Paw Fire Department is the primary emergency response agency for all general facility emergencies. \n\n\n\n\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety Planned changes to improve safety in the future include addressing recent audit and PHA findings in a timely manner and sharing of best practices with other CCNA facilities.\n\n"
