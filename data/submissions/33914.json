      "SummaryText": "ATED \r\nSUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe CRRMLLC refinery, located at North and Linden streets near Coffeyville, KS, operates a \r\nvariety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., gasoline, diesels, propane, and butane) \r\nfrom raw crude oil. Hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds are present in crude oil, that \r\nproduce sulfur dioxide when combusted. Even though these compounds are present in the \r\nrefinery and are not stored above thresholds to be included in this plan, hydrogen sulfide has been \r\nincluded as a general duty to inform the public.  This plan has also been prepared for hydrogen \r\nfluoride, propane and butane that are either used or produced during the refining process. The \r\nrefining process consists of:\r\n\r\n1.\tSeparation:  Liquid hydrocarbons are distilled by heat separation into gases, gasoline, diesel \r\nfuel, fuel oils and heavier residual material.\r\n2.\tConversion:  There are three common conversion processes:\r\na.\tCracking:  This process breaks or cracks large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller \r\nones.  This is done by thermal or catalytic cracking.\r\nb.\tReforming:  High temperatures and catalysts are used to rearrange the \tchemical \r\nstructure of a particular oil stream to improve its quality.\r\nc.\tCombining:  Chemically combines two or more hydrocarbons such as liquid \r\npetroleum gas (LPG) materials to produce high-grade gasoline.\r\n3.\tPurification:  Converts compounds to an easily removable or an acceptable form.\r\n4.\tBlending:  Mixes combinations of hydrocarbon liquids to produce a final product(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the \r\nCRRMLLC refinery.  Processes at the refinery are regulated by both EPA RMP regulation and \r\nOSHA PSM standard.\r\n\r\n4.1  Employee Participation\r\n\r\nCRRMLLC employees participate in many facets of process safety management and accident \r\nprevention.

In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that \r\naddress process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to \r\npromote both process and personal safety. The teams are typically comprised of members from \r\nvarious areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant \r\nmanagement. \r\n\r\n4.2  Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nCRRMLLC keeps a variety of technical documents and standard operating procedures that are \r\nused to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical \r\nproperties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical \r\ninventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within \r\nthe refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure \r\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information \r\naddresses any known hazards associated with the use and handling of chemicals. The refinery \r\nensures that processes are maintained within operating limits using process controls and \r\nmonitoring instruments, protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) and \r\nhighly trained personnel.\r\n\r\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the \r\ndesign and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically \r\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these \r\nhazards.\r\nThe refinery primarily uses the What if/What if Checklist technique to perform Process Hazard \r\nAnalysis (PHA).  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and \r\nmaintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.

These procedures can be used as a \r\nreference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  \r\nThe procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect \r\nchanges made through the management of change process. These procedures are periodically \r\nreviewed and certified as current and accurate.\r\n4.5  Training\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, CRRMLLC has implemented a \r\ncomprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New \r\nemployees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such \r\noperations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior \r\noperator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through \r\ntests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe \r\nmanner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive \r\nrefresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are \r\nmaintained at an acceptable level.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) \r\ninformation about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) \r\nsafe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the CRRMLLC refinery evaluates \r\ncontractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery \r\npersonnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling \r\ntheir safety obligations.\r\n\r\n4.7  Pre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nCRRMLLC conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change \r\nin the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, \r\nprocedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing \r\nthe equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction \r\nis in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally \r\nready.

On March the 3rd, 2004 \r\nCoffeyville Resources purchased this refinery and through preliminary review of the previous \r\nowners records there were 3 incidents over the past 5 years that require RMP reporting.  Each of \r\nthese incidents occurred in the Alkylation Unit and the Hazardous Chemical involved was \r\nHydrofluoric Acid.  None of these incidents resulted in any off-site impact; however each \r\nincident had employee injuries associated with them.  Two incidents had releases of Hydrofluoric \r\nAcid of less than 10 lbs.  The third had a release of Hydrofluoric Acid of less than 20 lbs.  \r\nCoffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing employees have placed emphasis on these incidents \r\nand measures have been taken to enhance the Safety performance in this area and throughout the \r\nrefinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe CRRMLLC refinery maintains a written Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan, to \r\nprotect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures \r\nfor responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or \r\nexplosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.
