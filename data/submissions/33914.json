      "SummaryText": "ATED \n\nSUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe CRRMLLC refinery, located at North and Linden streets near Coffeyville, KS, operates a \n\nvariety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., gasoline, diesels, propane, and butane) \n\nfrom raw crude oil. Hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur compounds are present in crude oil, that \n\nproduce sulfur dioxide when combusted. Even though these compounds are present in the \n\nrefinery and are not stored above thresholds to be included in this plan, hydrogen sulfide has been \n\nincluded as a general duty to inform the public.  This plan has also been prepared for hydrogen \n\nfluoride, propane and butane that are either used or produced during the refining process. The \n\nrefining process consists of:\n\n\n\n1.    Separation:  Liquid hydrocarbons are distilled by heat separation into gases, gasoline, diesel \n\nfuel, fuel oils and heavier residual material.\n\n2.    Conversion:  There are three common conversion processes:\n\na.    Cracking:  This process breaks or cracks large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller \n\nones.  This is done by thermal or catalytic cracking.\n\nb.    Reforming:  High temperatures and catalysts are used to rearrange the     chemical \n\nstructure of a particular oil stream to improve its quality.\n\nc.    Combining:  Chemically combines two or more hydrocarbons such as liquid \n\npetroleum gas (LPG) materials to produce high-grade gasoline.\n\n3.    Purification:  Converts compounds to an easily removable or an acceptable form.\n\n4.    Blending:  Mixes combinations of hydrocarbon liquids to produce a final product(s).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  GENERAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the \n\nCRRMLLC refinery.  Processes at the refinery are regulated by both EPA RMP regulation and \n\nOSHA PSM standard.\n\n\n\n4.1  Employee Participation\n\n\n\nCRRMLLC employees participate in many facets of process safety management and accident \n\nprevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling"

Additional ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program \n\nis documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained as part of the refinery Process \n\nSafety Management Plan.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that \n\naddress process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to \n\npromote both process and personal safety. The teams are typically comprised of members from \n\nvarious areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant \n\nmanagement. \n\n\n\n4.2  Process Safety Information\n\n\n\nCRRMLLC keeps a variety of technical documents and standard operating procedures that are \n\nused to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical \n\nproperties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical \n\ninventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within \n\nthe refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure \n\ntreatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information \n\naddresses any known hazards associated with the use and handling of chemicals. The refinery \n\nensures that processes are maintained within operating limits using process controls and \n\nmonitoring instruments, protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems) and \n\nhighly trained personnel.\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the \n\ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of \n\nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This \n\ninformation, in com"

Within this program, each process is systematically \n\nexamined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these \n\nhazards.\n\nThe refinery primarily uses the What if/What if Checklist technique to perform Process Hazard \n\nAnalysis (PHA).  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and \n\nmaintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates \n\nhazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes \n\nsuggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such \n\nmeasures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for review. Implementation of mitigation \n\noptions in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA \n\nteam.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk \n\nreceive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA \n\nteam findings are tracked until they are complete.

New \n\nemployees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such \n\noperations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior \n\noperator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through \n\ntests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe \n\nmanner on their own, they can work independently.

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit \n\nreports are retained.  \n\n\n\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe CRRMLLC refinery has a very good record of accident prevention.  On March the 3rd, 2004 \n\nCoffeyville Resources purchased this refinery and through preliminary review of the previous \n\nowners records there were 3 incidents over the past 5 years that require RMP reporting.  Each of \n\nthese incidents occurred in the Alkylation Unit and the Hazardous Chemical involved was \n\nHydrofluoric Acid.  None of these incidents resulted in any off-site impact; however each \n\nincident had employee injuries associated with them.  Two incidents had releases of Hydrofluoric \n\nAcid of less than 10 lbs.  The third had a release of Hydrofluoric Acid of less than 20 lbs.  \n\nCoffeyville Resources Refining & Marketing employees have placed emphasis on these incidents \n\nand measures have been taken to enhance the Safety performance in this area and throughout the \n\nrefinery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

In addition, the CRRMLLC refinery has procedures that address maintenance, \n\ninspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the \n\nuse of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as \n\nnecessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program \n\nis updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery \n\nfacilities. \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for CRRMLLC interfaces with plans developed by \n\nother local emergency response organizations. This coordination includes periodic meetings \n\nthat include local emergency response officials, local government officials, industry \n\nrepresentatives and the local media.  The CRRMLLC refinery has around-the-clock \n\ncommunications capability with emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, \n\npolice, and media). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, \n\nas well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to participating in \n\nMontgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) meetings, CRRMLLC \n\nconducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response \n\norganizations. The refinery provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders \n\nregarding the hazards of regulated substances that are present in the refinery. \n\n    \n\n7.  CONCLUSION\n\n\n\nCRRMLLC has implemented a number of steps to improve the safety of the processes. All of the \n\nprograms covered in this submittal are designed to facilitate change of unsafe situations and to \n\nensure that when changes are performed to the processes in the facility, that they do not \n\n"
