      "SummaryText": "W. E. DUNN WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe W. E. Dunn Wastewater Treatment Facility is a facility whose primary activity is the treatment\n\nof wastewater.  The Facility uses one regulated substance, chlorine (CAS 7782-50-5) as a\n\ndisinfectant to treat wastewater during the chlorination process.  The chlorination process consists\n\nof chlorine storage and the chlorination system used to disinfect the wastewater.  The chlorination\n\nprocess begins with the withdrawal of chlorine from the chlorine cylinders by a vacuum created by\n\nvacuum regulators mounted on the cylinders.  The chlorine gas travels through PVC pipes to\n\nchlorinators, where the chlorine supply is regulated and measured.  From the chlorinators, chlorine\n\nis mixed with reuse water by chlorine injectors to produce a solution which is injected into the\n\neffluent water for disinfection.\n\n\n\nThe hazard assessment was performed on the chlorination process using the United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP*CompTM. Model.  The worst-case release scenario\n\nwas assumed to be the release of a one ton cylinder for a duration of 10 minutes in an enclosed\n\nbuilding.  The alternative release scenario selected for the Facility was a failure scenario developed\n\nduring the process hazard review and analysis.  In this scenario, a 0.25-inch diameter whip\n\nconnecting a one-ton cylinder to the chlorination manifold is sheared off, creating a leak in the\n\nsystem.  The Facility has the capability of responding to and stopping the leak within one hour of\n\ndetection.  For both scenarios, the off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site receptors\n\ncould be potentially impacted by the release of chlorine.  Although off-site areas would be impacted,\n\nwe believe that safety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce the potential for off-site\n\nconsequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding community.  Our safety devices include\n\nchlorine leak detectors, alarms, and an automa"

In addition, the chlorine cylinders are housed in a building with exhaust fans and\n\nvents which would dilute the chlorine gas concentration should a release occur.\n\n\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), we have developed an\n\naccidental release prevention program and emergency action plan for our facility. The accidental\n\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the EPA RMP and the Occupational Safety\n\nand Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention\n\nprogram ensures that our facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of an accidental\n\nrelease of chlorine is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce the potential of an\n\naccidental release due to human error, or equipment failure at our facility.  In order to prevent the\n\nrelease of chlorine due to human error, our prevention program ensures that operating procedures\n\nare current and reviewed annually.  Training also plays a vital part in our program.  Employees and\n\ncontractors working near or on the chlorination process are required to be trained in the chlorination\n\nprocess and the hazards of chlorine.   \n\n\n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, our program ensures that\n\nequipment inspections, tests, and preventive maintenance in accordance with accepted engineering\n\npractices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All chlorine cylinders are examined upon\n\ndelivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage.  In addition, equipment pertaining to the\n\nchlorine process is visually inspected daily.  The potential for a chlorine release is greatly reduced\n\nin the chlorination process due to the use of a vacuum system from the point of chlorine withdrawal\n\nto its point of application.

Employees were\n\ninvolved in determining hazards of the process and subsequent consequences.  The chlorination\n\nprocess was found to be operating safely and no changes were recommended. \n\n  \n\nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at our facility.
