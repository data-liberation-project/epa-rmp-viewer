Enerfin Resources I LP demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\n\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant, located near Tecumseh, Oklahoma, operates a variety of processes to produce natural gas liquids from natural gas gathered from various sources. Regulated flammables, including natural gas liquids (NGL) are present but no regulated toxic substances are present above threshold amounts at the Tecumseh Gas Plant. The facility is a refrigeration unit using compressed propane to cool the incoming gas stream. This liberates natural gas liquids which are separated in the three phase separator then stabilized in a tower using glycol as a heat source. The stabilized liquids are stored and delivered to a ONEOK liquid pipeline within the plant yard. The Tecumseh Plant has the capability of loading and transporting the natural gas liquids via tanker trucks. The glycol is also used to inhibit freezing by injecting it into the gas inlet stream. The glycol is recovered in the three-phase separator and sent to the regenerator, where the water entrained in the glycol is boiled off. The pipeline quality gas exiting the three phase separator is cross exchanged (gas/gas exchanger) with the gas inlet then sent to ONEOK's purchase meter located within the facility.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.50 miles. Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the 8,000 gallon propane tank mentioned above. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is 0.20 miles. This event was selected as being a more practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Tecumseh Gas Plant. It is a small, two person operation (i.e. while performing maintenance or checking levels, gauges, etc.), skid-mounted natural gas refrigeration plant. The plant is subject to EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) Program 3, and to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standards. The plant has more than a threshold quantity of flammable chemicals, e.g. natural gas and NGLs, in a process. The Tecumseh Gas Plant has several residences within the area of concern but there are no businesses or schools in the area of concern. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process. These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nHazard Analysis\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant has"

Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe process hazard analysis is conducted by a team with expertise of this type of facility and in hazard analysis procedures. This team analyzes and evaluates hazards of the processes, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when it is believed such measures are necessary.\n\nThe process hazard analysis findings are presented to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by the team. The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to the team's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they are completed. The final solution of each finding is documented and retained. Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed. The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained. Once the team's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees. The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\n\nIn addition, the Tecumseh Gas Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to o"

New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through demonstrations) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. The refresher training is conducted at least every three years including a written test. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner.

Another part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSecurity\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant uses a locked gate to control the entry and exit of Enerfin Resources I LP and contractor personnel.\n\nIncident Investigation \n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard analyses.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Tecumseh Gas Plant conducts an audit at least every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

      "SummaryText": " develops findings that are forwarded to Tecumseh Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Tecumseh Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nAccident Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Tecumseh Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release and to reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Containment Control \n\n1) Valves to permit isolation of the process.\n\n2) Gas monitors and alarms.\n\n3) Automated bypasses and manual shutoffs for specific process parameters.\n\n4) Pressure relief valves will be properly identified and tested at least every 3 years. Any such valve that fails a test will be replaced or repaired and tested annually until engineering is satisfied that it's reliable.\n\n5) Baseline ultrasonic testing thickness testing (for pipe corrosion) will be performed prior to startup and every 3 years there after.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1) The Tecumseh Fire Department has been notified about the potential hazards of the facility.\n\nFIVE YEAR HISTORY\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant has not had any accidents within the past 5 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response pr"

      "SummaryText": "ogram that is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The facility is a non-responding site, though the program does include procedures for only an initial response to a fire or explosion to mitigate a potentially catastrophic release, and only when response can be effected without danger of personal injury to employee. The plan also covers the sequential steps of addressing a potential fire, spill, tornado, and bomb threat. The program addresses the responsibilities of each member of the emergency response team and outlines the network of communication to ensure success. When necessary, the emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to gas plant processes. The overall emergency response program for the Tecumseh Gas Plant is coordinated with the Pottawatomie County Emergency Management Official. The facility has around-the-clock communications capability with the Emergency Management Official which provides a means of notifying the public of an incident.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Tecumseh Gas Plant resolves all findings from hazard analyses, some of which may result in modification to the process. At the current time, any possible recommendations from hazard analyses will be completed within 180 days of the latest hazard analysis."
