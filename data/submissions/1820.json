      "SummaryText": "Houston Chemical Distributors, L.L.C. (HCD) was formed in 1981.  HCD manufactures and distributes high quality specialty chemicals that are primarily used in water, water treatment and other process applications.  These products solve the problem of meeting increasing grovernment regulations in this area by controlling chlorine, alkalinity, clarification, odor, dust, and heavy metal content.\nThe regulated substances are Ammonia (anhydrous) and Ammonia (concentrations 20% or greater).  In order to prevent accidental releases of Ammonia (anhydrous) a percent gauge is used on the storage vessel.  The vessel is only filled to a certain percentage.  The Ammonia (concentrations 20% or greater) storage vessels have gauge glasses installed on them.  The vessels are only filled to a certain level to prevent overfilling.  The worst-case scenario of Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a liquid spill and vaporization of 1,000 lbs, at a release rate of 100 lbs/min, with the release duration being 10 minutes.  The wind speed is 1.5 - 3 m/sec with a 1 mile distance to endpoint which is residences.  The passive mitigation used is a diked wall around the involved vessel.  The alternative worst-case scenario of Ammonia (concentrations 20% or greater) involves a liquid spill and vaporization of 500 lbs, at a release rate of 50 lbs/min, with the release duration being 10 minutes.  The wind speed is 1.5 - 3 m/sec with a 1 mile distance to endpoint which is residences.  The passive mitigation used is a diked wall around the involved vessel.  The five-year accident history for HCD indicates accidental releases on the dates of May 1, 1997; September 18, 1997 and December 16, 1997.  The following Emergency Response Plans have been put into place to assure that emergencies will be responded to in a timely manner that protects neighbors, employees and property of HCD.  Emergency Response Plan of Action; Emergency Reponse Plan; Evacuation Plan; Emergency Action Plan - Frie; Emergency Action Plan - Sp"
