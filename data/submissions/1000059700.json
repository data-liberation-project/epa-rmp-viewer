The high stage refrigeration screw compressor utilizes Liquid Injection Cooling (LIC) from the High-Pressure Receiver, while the reciprocating compressors are cooled via water jackets.  The purpose of the compressors is to create a suction that will pull the low-pressure vapor from the Accumulator and to compress the vapor to a high temperature and high pressure.

      "SummaryText": "ia and 1 mile northeast of the town of Sisquoc.  The area surrounding the facility is largely agricultural with mountainous areas to the east.\r\n\r\nThe facility maintains approximately 25 full time employees on site.  The plant operates one shift most of the year, except during the grape harvest, when operation extends to 24 hours per day and additional employees are hired for the season and an additional shift is added.  \r\n\r\nThe plant is comprised of two large buildings for barrel storage and production, tank farms along the east and south, a loading dock, wastewater treatment system, parking, and the refrigeration system equipment pad.  The facility main entrance along Santa Maria Mesa Road is used by employees, visitors, contractors, truck deliveries, and shipping.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Evacuation Assembly Area is located as required for potential evacuations.  Employees are trained and drill for alarm responses and evacuations.\r\n\r\nProcess Description \r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia as the heat transfer fluid.  The ammonia refrigeration process is a closed-loop, single-stage, mechanical refrigeration system.  The system is automatically controlled by microprocessors at the compressors, which minimize the potential for human error.\r\n\r\nWhile anhydrous ammonia is used as the primary refrigerant in the refrigeration system, glycol is used as the secondary and direct cooling medium for cooling barrel storage areas.  The system cooling configuration is flooded to ensure sufficient liquid ammonia for the glycol plate and frame heat exchanger for optimal heat exchange.  Wine tanks are cooled with direct expansion of ammonia in coils around the tanks.  The system is charged with approximately 12,790 lbs. anhydrous ammonia and is a built-up system.  \r\n\r\nFacility maintenance mechanics regularly monitor process parameters, including pressure, temperature, and vessel levels for proper operation.  Abnormal conditions are corrected by refrigeration contractor techn"

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe CalARP Program is designed to prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating and implementing our policies and procedures for the management of process hazards in design, construction, start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance, and the other matters addressed in the CalARP Program regulation.\r\n\r\nEmployees are provided with hazard awareness training and participate in the implementation of the Program.  The CalARP Program documents that are created pursuant to this Program are made accessible to our employees and to other affected persons in accordance with applicable requirements and the provisions of the CalARP Program and the OSHA PSM Standard.\r\n\r\nEmergency planning and response measures have been developed and implemented for proper and safe evacuation of those on site and for notifications to outside emergency responders.  These measures reflect the established policies of this facility for ensuring the health and safety of all employees and those who may be on site or in the area in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel ensure that safety and environmental policies are implemented at this facility by conducting periodic compliance inspections.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe Cambria Winery is located at 5475 Chardonnay Lane, Santa Maria, California.  The winery is owned by Jackson Family Wines, which is located at 421 Aviation Boulevard, Santa Rosa, California.  The Cambria Winery refrigeration system was designed and installed by Industrial Refrigeration and Process Piping, Inc. (IRAPP) and began operation in 1988.\r\n\r\nThis facility operates one (1) anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  The initial PHA was completed on June 23, 2005 by Axiom Engineers and revalidated July 8, 2011.\r\n\r\nThe plant is located approximately 15 miles east of the city of Santa Mar"
