      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Foster Farms Farmerville Facility.  Foster Farms has revised this document to comply with the required 5-year update for the RMP Submittal and associated program elements. The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in these systems exceeds the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold reporting quantities of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nMany state-of-the-art safety features were incorporated into the ammonia refrigeration systems at the facility as part of the original system construction and system modifications. Foster Farms will continue to improve ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM programs. In the unlikely event that a ammonia release does occur at the facility, Foster Farms personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures and do not rely on support services provided by the local fire department and/or hazardous materials response team to end the release.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used in closed-loop refrigeration systems at the facility. The systems provide cooling for production areas, storage areas, freezers, product, water chilling, and ice making. Central computer systems monitor and control the refrigeration systems. The desired temperatures are maintained by controlling the flow of ammonia with manually and electrically operated valves, float switches, transfer pumps, and compressor controls.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Farmerville Facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate one worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulati"

      "SummaryText": "ons) for a facility and an alternative release scenario for each covered chemical. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as \"...the greatest amount held in a single vessel...released as a gas over 10 minutes.\" An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility. For facilities with multiple processes, the regulations require that the worst case scenario with the greatest distance to the toxic endpoint must be modeled. Additional worst case scenarios are not required if the affected populations from worst case release scenarios from other processes are within the populations affected by the selected scenario.  \r\n\r\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios and presented in the RMP submittal. The results of the Hazard Assessment are also published in a report at the facility. In accordance with the PSM and RMP regulations, Foster Farms also performs periodic audits and hazards reviews to enhance continued safe performance. Recommended actions to improve safety are identified during these audits and reviews and are tracked regularly for completion as required. \r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility. The facility has experienced no reportable ammonia release within the past five years.  \r\n\r\nFoster Farms is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community. The accidental release prevention policies are designed to comply with the PSM and RMP regulations. These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur. The emergency response policies are designed to comply with all governmental emergency response regulations.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms accidental release prevention programs are based on the following key elements:\r\n+\tHands-on and classroom training of the refrigeration mechanics and operators\r\n+\tPre"

A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the refrigeration systems.

The mitigation measures suggested by the previous PHA team have already been implemented.  Others resulting from the recent PHA revalidation will be implemented during the next several months. Foster Farms will respond to all suggested mitigation measures promptly. Foster Farms is scheduling completion of proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with Foster Farms' commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations.\r\n\r\nFoster Farms recognizes that the RMP/PSM is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as Foster Farm continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. Foster Farms will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements or modifications to the RMP/PSM and related attachments and program elements will be incorporated consistent with Foster Farms' internal review practices and Foster Farms will maintain the most current versions on site. Thus, the most current version RMP/PSM, related documents and elements maintained on site may vary slightly from the information submitted to the EPA and other regulatory agencies."
