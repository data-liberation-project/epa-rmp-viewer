The training places an emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the job.  \n\nContractors\nThe Shell Chemical Company uses contractors regularly and to supplement the workforce during periods of high activity.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Shell Chemical Company has procedures in place to ensure contractors have the proper knowledge of and training on plant systems, procedures, and processes before they go to work at the site.  Safety performance constitutes a major factor in the overall evaluation of contractor performance and Shell performs periodic evaluations of contractor compliance with Shell and regulatory requirements.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\nShell Chemical Company conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, all major projects, major turnarounds, and minor turnarounds require a PSSR to be performed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team creates an Expected State of Readiness Document, which is used to verify all aspects of the organization's readiness.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\nThe Shell Chemical Company has well-established practices and procedures to maintain the integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems.

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Shell Chemical Geismar periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at the specified frequency until the process ceases to operate.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Shell Chemical Geismar plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operation such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\nTraining\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell Chemical Geismar has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  To be qualified to perform a particular job, the Technician must complete the training for that job.  Initial and refresher training records for each employee involved in operating a covered process are maintained in the Shell Training and Record keeping System, which is maintained by the Training Section of the Human Resources Department.

Inspection and tests are performed to help ensure that process equipment functions as intended, and to verify that this equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service, or the Mechanical Equipment Team (MET) or the Pressure Systems Team (PST) will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nShell Chemical Company has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with the training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\nManagement of Change\nThe Shell Chemical Company has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

As part of this commitment, Shell Chemical Company has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility.  One part of this system is the Risk Management Program (RMP) that complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Shell Chemical Company in Geismar, LA.\n\nThis submittal has been issued to meet the 5 year update requirement.  It coincides with the shutdown of the EOEG-1 unit.  Since the initial submittal, the site has added two new units (AO-3, which falls Prevention Program Level 3 requirements, and K-5, which falls under Prevention Program Level 1 requirements).  Two units have been shutdown dismantled, and removed from the program (EOEG-1 in 2007, and PK-1 in 1999).\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nShell Chemical Company implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained personnel respond to control and contain such releases as appropriate.  Each situation is evaluated individually and appropriate measures are taken to protect the employees and the community.  Shell Chemical Company, the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and neighboring industry have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  Shell Chemical Company does not expect a worst case scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of the facility like Shell Chemical Company.  ARSs help the LEPC improve the community response plan.  \n\nRadii of potential impact for all release scenarios were determined using guidance in the RMP rule and the lookup tables from the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document, dated May 24, 1996 and RMP* COMP Version 1.07.\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place for the Program 3 processes at the Shell Chemical Company Geismar Plant.
