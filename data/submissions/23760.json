      "SummaryText": "Ft. Worth Distribution Center\n\n\nA Risk Management Plan will be implemented at the Ft. Worth facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility will be located at 850 transport Drive in Ft. Worth, (Tarrant County) Texas. The facility will be a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products, packaged in aerosol cans, manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son. S. C. Johnson is a privately held, family-managed company, with worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in the aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends. The maximum projected quantities (cases) of aerosol products stored in the warehouse and the product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage process. \n\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on  EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint will not extend beyond plant property. No offsite receptors are impacted. \n\nEmergency response activities at the Ft. Worth Facility are coordinated with the Tarrant County LEPC and the Tarrant County Sheriff Department."
