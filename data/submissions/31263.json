(JCI) owns and operates a foam seat manufacturing facility located in Jefferson City, Missouri (JCI-Jefferson City).  The foam process utilizes Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), a RMP-regulated chemical.  The maximum intended inventory of TDI on site is above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds listed in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 68.130.\n\nSince the quantity of TDI exceeds the threshold quantity, JCI-Jefferson City is required to implement a Risk Management Program (RMP).  JCI-Jefferson City is subject to Program Level 2 requirements. This Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) submission presents the details of the RMP compliance measures conducted by JCI-Jefferson City.  The required RMP information was initially submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in a timely manner before the deadline of June 21, 1999.  This RMPlan is being submitted prior to the 6/21/2004 anniversary date to fulfill the 5-year anniversary submission requirements.  No major changes have occurred at the facility since the initial RMPlan submission.\n\nThis executive summary addresses the requirements of the RMP Rule found at \u00a768.155.  Per the revised rule, a summary of the off-site consequence analysis is not included in this Executive Summary.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nJCI-Jefferson City has implemented various policies/procedures and other measures to ensure safety of the TDI process.  Accidental prevention measures include: engineering controls, air monitoring, equipment inspections/tests, preventative maintenance program, operating procedures, employee training, maintaining a supply of appropriate safety and personal protective equipment, and routine inspections/checks of areas where TDI is stored/used.\n\nJCI-Jefferson City has employees on all shifts that are trained to respond to releases of TDI at the facility.

This plan has been designed to comply with all applicable state and federal regulations.  This plan summarizes actions necessary to safely respond to a chemical release and include internal and external notification/communication requirements.\n\nJCI-Jefferson City is an active member of the Cole County LEPC and has been included in the community response plan.  Arrangements have also been made with outside spill contractors to provide additional assistance, if necessary, in the event of a chemical release.\n\nJohnson Controls, Inc. has established a corporate Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Environmental (HSEE) Policy and Procedure that demonstrate the commitment of senior management to providing a safe and healthy workplace and to demonstrating world class leadership in environmental management.\n\n1.2 Description of JCI-Jefferson City and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nJCI-Jefferson City produces molded polyurethane foam for automotive seating applications.  Foam production is a result of a specific blend of chemicals, including TDI, which are poured into specially designed molds.  The finished foam parts are removed from the molds and moved to the warehouse where they are packed and stored until distribution to \u00bftrim facilities\u00bf at other locations, where the foam parts are covered and track mechanisms are installed.\n\nThe RMP regulated substance handled at this facility is Toluene Diisocyanate (unspecified isomers) [Benzene, 1,3-diisocyanatomethyl-].  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored in the plant (i.e., not including the rail car) is 227,200 pounds.\n\nThe JCI-Jefferson City facility is certified to both ISO 14001 (international standard for environmental management systems) and ISO/TS16949 (international standard for quality management systems in the automotive industry).\n\n1.3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention St"

All chemical storage tanks are located indoors, above ground with secondary containment.  Tanks critical to the process have level sensors to prevent any tank from being overfilled.  Fill duration is also monitored during the transfer of TDI to the process lines and if not satisfied within a set time period, auto filling ceases and an alarm is activated.  Chemical wet systems are equipped with high and low-pressure switches to shut down in the event of a line rupture.  Critical valves are monitored electronically as to open/closed positioning.\n\nJCI-Jefferson City has a preventative maintenance software program in place to address maintenance of all vital parts of the plant's day-to-day operations.  Specific environmental issues are also addressed with this computer driven program.\n\nJCI-Jefferson City has established an Air Monitoring Program that monitors the airborne concentration of TDI within the production facility.\n\nInspections and checks of processing areas and internal safety audits are conducted of the processing areas on a routine basis.  Action items are tracked, as applicable, to ensure timely resolution.\n\nProperty Conservation and Risk Management audits are conducted annually by Factory Mutual Risk Appraisers.  Environmental audits are routinely conducted by the JCI corporate environmental department located in Plymouth, Michigan via an outside contractor.  Surveillance audits of JCI-Jefferson City\u00bfs environmental management system are conducted semi-annually by a 3rd party registrar to maintain ISO 14001 certification.  The JCI corporate safety department via an outside contractor conducts annual safety audits of the facility.    \n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years, there have been no accidental releases of TDI at JCI-Jefferson City as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42.

In the event of a release, JCI-Jefferson City\u00bfs internal Spill Team will respond using appropriate actions, as described in JCI-Jefferson City\u00bfs Contingency and Emergency Response Plan.\n\n \nJCI-Jefferson City\u00bfs Spill Team has been trained to respond to in-house chemical releases.  The spill team receives annual refresher training, which includes hands-on drills.  The Contingency and Emergency Response Plan establishes an Incident Command System, which describes the roles of the various Spill Team Members.  This plan describes internal reporting requirements, which includes a Chemical Release Report Form, and incident investigation to determine the root cause of the incident and to identify corrective actions to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.  The plan also describes external reporting requirements to appropriate agencies for releases exceeding the Reportable Quantity. \n\nJCI-Jefferson City\u00bfs Contingency and Emergency Response Plan also documents external \u00bfexperts\u00bf that may be contacted for advice or assistance in the event of a TDI release.  These experts include Bayer Corporation, the supplier of TDI, and contract hazardous materials response firms with which JCI maintains emergency response service contracts. \n \nJCI-Jefferson City actively participates in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Cole County and has been included in the community emergency response plan.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nJCI-Jefferson City is committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of its operation, including safety.
