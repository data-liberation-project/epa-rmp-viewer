We have lowered to hold as minimal amounts on hand ,strictly only what is on hand in our process tank. We have tanks at ground level with a secondary containment around them in the department to hold double what's being used so In no way could an accidental release make it outside. Our location of the process is far enough removed from the outside that in no way should it ever impact wildlife or human life. In house awareness training in our process is always going on to maintain safety and minimize all risk's. In any event of risk or exposure we work closely with Fire department and a chemical waste removal company that are both trained in emergency response with hazardous chemicals.\n\nRantec Microwave is an Aerospace manufacture which we chemically plate Aluminum metal for use in conditions not in normal environments.  We have a small team that has been doing this process for a long time and our ongoing training in Haz-Com and site specific chemicals on a yearly basis has geared us to a safety awareness atmosphere. Our plating process is very single lined assembly in nature so very clean and easy. We do have multiple process options for plating material for our customers. The bulk of our facility Metal machines on CNC's and then they are assembled and tested on site after they are chemically plated.\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nRantec Microwave Systems Inc. Is committed to operate in a manner that is safe for our employee's, the community, and the environment. As part of this commitment, Rantec has established a Risk Management Program that helps the company to identify and communicate risks associated with our operations.

Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nIn pursuant to S25534 California Health & Safety Code, Rantec is required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Program (RMP) plan due to the onsite process containing regulated chemical above it's threshold quantity.\n\nThe regulated process is : Nitric Acid Cleaning Line\n\nNitric acid, a Cal-Arp regulated toxic substance, is present above it's 1000 pound threshold. Hence, it meets the criteria for the Cal-Arp program level 1.\n\nIn addition to Nitric acid, Rantec uses several other chemicals currently not being subject to the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nRantec is dedicated to continuous improvement on it's environmental, health and safety program. The processing tanks containing nitric acid are equipped with secondary containment.\n\nRantec's employees are trained, knowledgeable, and skilled which results in a workforce that is very capable in their job performance. Employee's are provided with detailed information concerning their job duties and chemicals onsite,they are experienced in operating the process lines. Employee's are also trained on the facility's Emergency Reporting Procedure.\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nRantec has established policy that all incidents and near misses with the potential to cause any injury or damages are required to be investigated.
