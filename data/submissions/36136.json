Due to our release prevention policies, there has been no reportable accidental release of regulated substances, as defined by the RMP rule, during this period.\n\n \n6.Emergency Response Plan\n\nDow-GBO has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nAssumption Parish OEP is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThere are no planned changes at this time as a result of our implementing the accidental release prevention program."

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release should occur, we are coordinated with the Assumption Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nDow-GBO\u00bfs primary activity includes the solution mining of salt from the Napoleonville Dome, which is located in Assumption Parish and underlies a surface area of approximately 1670 acres.  Dow's operations on the Napoleonville Salt Dome began in 1957 with the drilling and mining of the Grace No. 1 well.  Since then, an additional 29 Dow operated caverns have been mined into the dome.  Fifteen of the active caverns are in hydrocarbon service with total storage capacity in excess of 38 million barrels.  Nine caverns are in mining service with a saturated brine deliverability of 8500 gallons per minute.  We have 8 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances (and their maximum inventory, in pounds) include Ethane (180,000,000), Butane (37,000,000), Pentane (160,000,000), Propylene  [1-Propene] (64,000,000), Methane (850,000), Ethylene [Ethene] (120,000,000), Propane (250,000,000) and Chlorine (8,000). \n\n\n \n3.The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenarios (WCS) and alternative Release scenarios (ARS)"

The WCS and ARS were discussed in the Executive Summary of the original submittal, but will not be repeated here.  \n\nIn accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18832, April 9, 2004), it is no longer required to include a discussion of the WCS and ARS the RMP\u00bfs Executive Summary.  However,  their results are included in the body of the submittal.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Dow-GBO facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDow-GBO maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Some of this documentation includes Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment spec sheets, and reactive chemicals tests.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the Dow Fire and Explosion Index, the Dow Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 3 years. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on Nov. 11,"
