Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of all Americold facilities to conduct all operations in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Americold implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility. The facility is completely coordinated with the Region 1 LEPC and the Vernon Fire Department, who provide emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe facility is located at 4224 District Boulevard, in Vernon, California.  The main business of Americold - Vernon Plant 2103 is cold storage.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility uses approximately 28,000 pounds of ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage, freezer storage, and dock areas. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Americold Vernon Plant 2103 ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operat"

For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA Process Safety Management regulation. \n\n\n\nSafety controls at the facility include auto purgers, diffusers, ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and an automatic shutdown system.  The majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room, just outside of the engine room in the Condensers and Thermo syphon Receiver and outside Warehouse #1 (Warehouse #1 Fish Room Recirculator and Warehouse #1 Blast Freezer Recirculator).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the diffusers and auto purgers.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates in accordance with many of the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere has been one significant release of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (April 2008 to April 2013) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. On July 3, 2010 a release of 551 lbs. of ammonia gas was reported to the proper authorities, in addition there were no injuries or property damage resulting from this ammonia release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Americold Vernon Plant 2103 facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\n The operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitig"

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn case of an ammonia emergency, the Americold Vernon Plant 2103 facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department).  The operator of the facility has coordinated emergency response efforts with the fire department.  Operators at the facility are trained to respond to releases of ammonia; however a full team cannot be provided.  Americold institutes a policy to respond to insignificant releases, the City of Vernon Fire Department will be contacted for larger releases. Americold operators are trained to assist the Fire Department once they arrive.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis performed on November 7, 2012, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the Americold Vernon Plant 2103 facility located in Vernon, California.  The Americold Vernon Plant 2103 safety committee is planning to complete the recommendations over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n\n\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n\n\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed.\n\n"
