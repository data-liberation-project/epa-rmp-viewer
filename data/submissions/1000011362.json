This successful operating record is due to the City's commitment to ongoing training programs, operating procedures, and maintenance activities.\n\nStationary Source and the Substance Handled\n\nThe City of Mitchell operates a water treatment facility in Mitchell, South Dakota.  The facility uses chlorine to reduce the pathogenic (disease causing) bacteria and viruses in potable water below the maximum contaminant levels set forth in the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nChlorine utilized in the disinfection process arrives at the facility in one ton containers that are stored inside a ventilated building equipped with a leak detection device.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored at the facility is 12,000 pounds.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Mitchell has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68 for Program Level 2.  The City will continuously evaluate and update their safety and prevention procedures as needed.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents, as described under 40 CFR 68.42(a), have occurred at the Mitchell WTF in the previous five years.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program established by the City of Mitchell for their WTF does not require personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The local emergency response agencies will be relied upon for coordinating all response actions resulting from the release and for informing the public about the release.  \n\nSafety Improvements\n\nThe facility regularly conducts process hazard reviews.  Any improvements made in response to the recommendations resulting from these reviews are documented."
