      "SummaryText": "The Trenton Water Works has implemented an Accidental Release Prevention Program that includes process safety information according to a documentation plan. A process hazard analysis and risk assesment review is conducted by the Water Treatment Superintendent, Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent, Senior Environmental Engineer, Maintenance Personnel, and Operating personnel. The total process experience of these individuals exceeds 80 years. Operating procedures are written and tracked by The Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is formulated and tracked by The Water Treatment Plant Superintendent and Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Training is accomplished in the classroom and on the job by the Operator Training Committee which consists of supervisory personnel and certified EHS operators. Understanding of the training is assured by written tests, oral tests, and demonstration. Training is tracked by a database and hardcopy records. The mechanical maintenance program is delegated to The Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. The program consists of equipment lists and specifications, equipment history, preventative maintenance procedures, and a demand work order system. The equipment history is analyzed periodically for equipment reliability. The Management of Change Program is assurred by The Assistant Water Treatment Plant Superintendent. Compliance Audits are conducted once per year by the program implementers. The incident investigation program follows corporate policy for fact determination, root cause system analysis, and recommendation implementation.  System update schedules are monitored by the program implementers. Employee participation is incorporated in each element program description. The contractor procedure follows a corporate contractor policy. The program is implemented by the contractor coordinator. Trenton Water Works Filtration Plant treats raw wate"

      "SummaryText": "r from the Delaware River. During the treatment process chlorine is used to disinfect the water. The liquid chlorine is extracted from 1-ton containers, evaporated into a gas, and injected into the water. There is never more than 2000 lbs available to the system at any one time. The worst case scenario is .2 miles by RMP COMP. The Alternate case scenario is .05 miles by RMP COMP. A Hazard Analysis and Risk Assesment Review conducted on 7/24/96 and revalidated on 7/01 and 7/06 demostrated that with the actual release prevention mechanisms and mitigation measures incorporated at this facility, the above worst case and alternative case scenarios are implausible. Trenton Water Works plans no safety improvements at this time because state of the art for design, operation, and inherently safe technology are currently implemented."
