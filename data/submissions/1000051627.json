Employees are trained by Brenntag Chemical Company in the proper handling of a chemical leak. Emergency equipment on hand include fully encapsulating suit with self contained breathing apparatus, rubber boots, gloves, face shields, splash-proof saftey googles. In case of an accidential release, Community Responders are trained to OSHA's Awareness and Operations with some incident Management System level by the Kentucky TECH/Fire and rescue Training  Branch. The local radio stations and television station would be notified in case of such accident.\r\n\r\nChlorine is transported by truck on I-65, the Louie B. Nunn Parkway and US 31E to the Green River Valley Water Treatment Plant by Brenntag Chemical Company,1405 Highway 136 W, P.O. Box 20, Henderson Ky. 42419-0020. A maximum of approximately 10,000 lbs. are handled and stored.\r\n\r\nWith any accidential release if the door to the facility can be closed safley, the spill will be contained in the chlorine room. A water spray can be directed at the vapors, not the point of leak, to reduce vapors. The runoff will be contained and neutralized with soda ash. The Hart Co. LEPC would be contacted for the spill containment and the cleanup and disposal would be accomplished per EPA and Kentucky Department of Natural Resources regulations. The facility's hazardous materials clean-up will be First Response, 1052 Searcy Way, Bowling Green, Ky 270-793-0906, 24 hr. emergency, 1-800-914-9111. If not available, Chemtrec would be called to activate Chlorep (Chlorine Emergency Response Team) to clean up spill. Any cleanup of hazardous waste will be accomplished through a plan approved by KY Natural Resources and/or US EPA. The distance to the endpoint (under worst case weather) the substance could travel 2.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine cylinders are checked daily"

The facility representative who meets the off-site response personnel shall have a copy of the Title II Plan, the facility contingency plan, material saftey data sheets and should brief the responders on the current situation. This response plan was determined ans developed through the joint efforts of the Green River Valley Water District and the Hart Co LEPC and Hart Co Fire Dept."
