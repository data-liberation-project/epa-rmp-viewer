This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an anhydrous ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed in 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks.  For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, to depict more of a worst case scenario.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate case distance to endpoint, the model results are included in RVC-Galva's onsite RMP records.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6 and the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.

Since the facility is in close proximity to the City of Galva and Highway 34, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons and the facility has an evacuation plan in place.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\r\nThe RVC-Galva facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia and propane storage and distribution plant.  The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at the facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize it for crop nutrient purposes.  While propane is a regulated substance under 112(r), the process is exempt from RMP reporting at this time because RVC-Galva is considered a retail facility where more than half of the income from propane is from direct sales to end users. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia system consists of two 30,000 gallon and one 26,000 gallons storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment.  Anhydrous ammonia is distributed on a seasonal basis (spring and fall).  Throughout the year, approximately 115 nurse tanks that vary in  from 2,280 to 1,000 gallons may be present at the site.  The maximum aggregate amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at the RVC-Galva facility at any given time is approximately 247,240 gallons (1,278,231 pounds). \r\n\r\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\nThe worst case release scenario depicted in the RMP is a release of the entire contents of the largest anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, 30,000 gallons or 155,100 pounds, creating a toxic vapor cloud.  A determination spreadsheet is included as part of RVC-Galva's onsite RMP records detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia (using a current MSDS - also included in onsite RMP records).

RVC-Galva has extended to the Galva Volunteer Fire Department and the Henry County LEPC the opportunity to visit the facility and to participate in mock emergency simulation training.  Annual Tier II reports are submitted to these agencies, as well, to keep them informed of maximum quanitites of ammonia stored onsite for emergency preparedness purposes.\r\n\r\nThe first section of this Executive Summary provides more detail on the general accidental release prevention program in place at the RVC-Galva facility.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nRVC-Galva has not had an accident in which the general public was involved and where ammonia was released causing death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia at the RVC-Galva location, it is company policy to immediately notify the Galva Volunteer Fire Department, the Henry County LEPC, and the IEMA to request that they respond to the emergency.  In the unlikely event that the Galva Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at the facility, a mutual aid fire department that the Galva Fire Department has an agreement with would be summoned.  This policy has been coordinated with the Galva Volunteer Fire Department and the Henry County LEPC.  Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected the anhydrous ammonia system; in addition, both entities have been provided photographs of the system for reference.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Program is intended to minimize the hazards to human health and the environment associated with anhydrous ammonia.

Training includes classroom instruction, onsite training at the facility, and follow up observation to determine comprehension and understanding.

It was determined that additional sections of the RMP were in need of updating, therefore this RMP resubmission is being submitted to update the RMP based on some administrative changes at the facility and to more accurately represent the storage amount of anhydrous ammonia onsite.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nRVC-Galva has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety.
