It was determined that additional sections of the RMP were in need of updating, therefore this RMP resubmission is being submitted to update the RMP based on some administrative changes at the facility and to more accurately represent the storage amount of anhydrous ammonia onsite.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nRVC-Galva has an ongoing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel on the proper operation and maintenance of equipment and having preventative maintenance programs in place.  RVC-Galva has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety (H&S) and Emergency Action Plans.  Employee training occurs on an annual basis in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  New employees are required to read the H&S and Emergency Action Plans and undergo training prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.  RVC-Galva's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe RVC-Galva facility complies with ANSI Standard K-61.1-most current standard requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and handling.  It is facility policy to adhere to the rules and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions, equipment, containers, and storage facilities administered by the Illinois Department of Agriculture.  If an emergency were to occur, it is RVC-Galva policy to immediately notify the Galva Volunteer Fire Department (via 911 call) and request that they respond to the emergency.

Since the facility is in close proximity to the City of Galva and Highway 34, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons and the facility has an evacuation plan in place.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nThe RVC-Galva facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia and propane storage and distribution plant.  The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at the facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize it for crop nutrient purposes.  While propane is a regulated substance under 112(r), the process is exempt from RMP reporting at this time because RVC-Galva is considered a retail facility where more than half of the income from propane is from direct sales to end users. \n\n\n\nThe ammonia system consists of two 30,000 gallon and one 26,000 gallons storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment.  Anhydrous ammonia is distributed on a seasonal basis (spring and fall).  Throughout the year, approximately 115 nurse tanks that vary in  from 2,280 to 1,000 gallons may be present at the site.  The maximum aggregate amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at the RVC-Galva facility at any given time is approximately 247,240 gallons (1,278,231 pounds). \n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst case release scenario depicted in the RMP is a release of the entire contents of the largest anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, 30,000 gallons or 155,100 pounds, creating a toxic vapor cloud.  A determination spreadsheet is included as part of RVC-Galva's onsite RMP records detailing the conversion from gallons to pounds of ammonia (using a current MSDS - also included in onsite RMP records).  RMP Comp was used to determine the worst case distance to endpoint, the model results are located in the onsite RMP records.  The ammonia tank sits over a gravel surface, passi"

No environmental receptors would be affected by a worst case release of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe alternate case release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  This scenario is considered the most likely cause of an anhydrous ammonia release onsite.  The alternate release duration assumed in 10 minutes with an atmospheric stability of D and wind speed of 3.0 m/sec.  The loadout risers used in filling nurse tanks are protected by breakaway couplers designed to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if the line or a hose breaks.  For this scenario passive and active mitigation was not considered, to depict more of a worst case scenario.  RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate case distance to endpoint, the model results are included in RVC-Galva's onsite RMP records.  Public receptor information was obtained using LandView 6 and the facility's knowledge of the surrounding area.  No environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate release of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, and manual shut-off valves.  All of the main storage tank valves are locked when not in use.\n\n\n\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 2 due to being ineligible for Program 1 (due to close proximity of public receptors) and is not considered covered by Program 3.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\nThe RVC-Galva facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.

In the unlikely event that the Galva Volunteer Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at the facility, a mutual aid fire department that the Galva Fire Department has an agreement with would be summoned.
