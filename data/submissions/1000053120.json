This updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tDawn Foods policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tDawn Foods Policies to Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Dawn Foods; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.

The facility is a producer of custom and branded snack cakes and muffins primarily for retail distribution. \r\n\r\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 311813. Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients and products.   \r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating baked goods ingredients and products. \r\n\r\nThe approximate ammonia charge for the refrigeration system has been calculated at 12,951 pounds. The refrigeration system is used to cool process rooms, holding freezers, coolers, docks, and blast freezers.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The \"low pressure\" equipment includes one (1) spiral freezer and two (2) storage freezer evaporators, one (1) low temperature pump receiver (V-4) with ammonia pumps (AP1 and AP2) and oil pot (V-5), and two (2) low temperature booster compressors (RC-1 and RC-2).  The \"high pressure\" equipment includes two (2) +60 - 70 muffin room evaporators, three (3) +60 - 80 autobake cooler evaporators, one (1) +40 finished product staging evaporator, one (1) +40 vestibule evaporator, two (2) +70 dry bulk cooler evaporators, one (1) +70 cup room evaporator, one (1) water chiller, two (2) +60 - 70 tempering room evaporators, two (2) +60 - 70 receiving dock evaporators, and two (2) +60 - 70 cookie mixing room cooler evaporators, one high temperature pump receiver (V-2) with ammonia pumps (AP3 and AP4) and oil pot (V-3), two (2) high stage compressors (RC-3 and RC-4).
