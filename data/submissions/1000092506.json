Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Donnelly Coop in Donnelly are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Donnelly Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 18,000-gallon tank, and seventeen 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Donnelly, Minnesota.  The maximum amount stored is 35,000 gallons (153,094 pounds)including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 78,733.8 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios (NOTE: Available only for incident planning use to LEPC, Fire Department and Donnelly Cooperative.)\r\n\r\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nDonnelly Coop maintains a detailed record of safety information"

Any non-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nDonnelly Coop truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\r\n\r\n  5. Five-year Accident History\r\nDonnelly Coop has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occurred during this period.\r\n\r\n  6. Emergency Response Plan\r\nDonnelly Coop maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and in the event of an accidental release, Donnelly Coop will contact local emergency response agencies and the public.
