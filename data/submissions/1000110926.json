This system is tested monthly to ensure\r\noperational status.\r\n\r\n(3) PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS: All recommendations developed during the Process Hazards\r\nAnalysis (PHA) Revalidation were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia\r\nRefrigeration System. Penobscot McCrum will evaluate each PHA recommendation and document\r\nthe action taken.\r\n\r\n(4) AUDITS: Programs are audited every 3 years as required by the OSHA PSM to improve Safety\r\nPerformance as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations.\r\n\r\n(5) STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES: SOP's are certified annually to be current and\r\ncorrect. They are revised as often as necessary to keep them current and correct.\r\n\r\n(6) TRAINING: Documented Orientation Training (both classroom and On-the-Job) is provided\r\nemployees before ammonia related work assignments are given.

DESCRIPTION OF THE Penobscot McCrum ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\nPROGRAM\r\n\r\nPenobscot McCrum annually conducts in house emergency action training and has developed a\r\nstrong relationship with the local public emergency response agencies. Penobscot McCrum has\r\nparticipated in a field training exercise with focused on an unified response to an unintentional\r\nammonia release situation.\r\n\r\nPenobscot McCrum conducts triennial PSM/RMP compliance audits of their PSM/RMP program to\r\nidentify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements. Penobscot McCrum considers the\r\nPSM/RMP manuals to be a living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain\r\ntheir viability and usefulness.\r\n\r\nPenobscot McCrum has and insists on employee participation from their ammonia process\r\noperators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nPenobscot McCrum provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program and\r\nmanagement system with specific training modules available for each ammonia process employee.\r\nPenobscot McCrum maintains a pro-active open-door policy toward neighbors and concerned\r\ncommunity citizens. Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted\r\nupon written request.\r\n\r\nV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no releases of ammonia during the past five years that resulted in an injury, or that\r\nhad an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\r\n\r\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nFacility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia releases with defensive\r\nmeasures; shelter in place, evacuate if necessary, give notice, and move to daily set assembly\r\nareas. The site emergency plan is coordinated with local Public Emergency Responders.\r\n\r\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY"

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\r\n\r\nPenobscot McCrum recognizes management's responsibility to protecting it's employees,\r\nequipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.\r\nThe control of ammonia release incidents has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of\r\nall Penobscot McCrum personnel who operate their ammonia refrigeration process.\r\n\r\nThe Penobscot McCrum PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for\r\ndeveloping, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its\r\nammonia operating and management systems. The Penobscot McCrum PSM/RMP program\r\nfocuses attention on making PSM/RMP an important part of its operation.\r\n\r\nPenobscot/McCrum believes that employee participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP\r\nprogram. Operating level employees, particularly the refrigeration manager has been deeply\r\ninvolved and he (along with the refrigeration system operators) assumes the major responsibility for\r\noperating the hazardous material process safely.\r\n\r\nThe Penobscot McCrum emergency action plan has been developed in house and has been\r\ncoordinated with the local public emergency response agencies. All Penobscot McCrum employees\r\nhave received documented emergency action training.\r\n\r\nII. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nPenobscot McCrum operates an ammonia refrigeration system. Ammonia is a common industrial\r\nchemical with applications in a large number of industries such as agriculture, water treatment, food\r\nstorage warehouses, pharmaceuticals, heat treating and many, many more. Ammonia has been\r\nlisted by both EPA and OSHA as a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nIII. SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\n\r\nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by PSM/RMP regulations and\r\nthe information developed has been used in the preparation of the Technical Studies and other\r\nDocu"
