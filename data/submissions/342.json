OLSON, PLANT MANAGER 507-238-2259 \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN-EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. THE FACILITY POLICY.\n          THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF NUWAY COOPERATIVE ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR,THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR\nOTHER AUTHORITIES,TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION.\n           THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR\nSALE TO FARMERS.\n           ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED AND STORED AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION.\nANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS USED FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n            THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 250,000 POUNDS IN OUR 18,000 AND 12,000 GALLON STORAGE  TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANK TRUCK HOLDING 40,000 POUNDS.\n\n3. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n     A. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER TEN MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 250,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .94 MILES.\n     B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BASED ON THE HAZARD  REVIEW  IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A 3 INCH PIPE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT  (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .78 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n           THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE '' SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE  STORAGE  AND HANDLING OF ANHYRROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1'', PUBLISHED BY THE  AMERICAN  NATIONAL STANDA"
