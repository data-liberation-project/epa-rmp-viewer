There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled  shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCatlettsburg Refining, LLC is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.  Catlettsburg Refining, LLC?s policy is to conduct activities so as to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out.  As part of this policy, Catlettsburg Refining, LLC has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Catlettsburg Refining, LLC and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to resubmit its risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Catlettsburg Refining, LLC every five (5) years.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan executive summary requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Catlettsburg Refining, LLC.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCatlettsburg Refining, LLC is committed to the safety of its employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Key to this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery.  Catlettsburg Refining, LLC utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  In the event of a release, the refinery has a well trained emergency response team to contain, mitigate, monitor"

      "SummaryText": ", and stop the release.  The refinery has fully staffed and trained emergency response teams for fire fighting (Fire and Rescue Squad), medical emergencies, and for ambient air monitoring (Air Monitoring Team).  Catlettsburg Refining, LLC evaluates each situation, responds based on the particular circumstances, and if necessary, requests assistance from outside emergency responders, including local fire departments, in controlling and containing the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release.  Catlettsburg Refining, LLC, the local emergency planning committees (LEPCs), and the fire department have also established a system for warning the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.\n\nThe Catlettsburg Refining, LLC Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program at the facility.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated by the Manager to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Manager.  Those relationships are depicted on the facility organization chart.  Specific responsibility for the implementation of the Process Safety Management (PSM), the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan and accident prevention program has been delegated to the Environmental, Safety and Security Manager.  The facility emergency response program, including compliance with the RMP aspects of that effort, is also the responsibility of the Environmental, Safety and Security Manager.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nCatlettsburg Refining, LLC primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise and a trained team leader. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the controls put in place originally and those added as a result of the HAZOP do not eventually deviate significantly from the original safety intent, Catlettsburg Refining, LLC periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.
