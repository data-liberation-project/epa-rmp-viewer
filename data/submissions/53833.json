Elevated jet plume releases were also evaluated, but found to have no ground level concentrations at or above the toxic endpoint for ammonia.  The population estimate remained unchanged after 2010 data was released.\r\n\r\nCOMPANY'S PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The company's prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Management standard.  The Mt. Storm Power Station has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  It does have an emergency response plan meeting OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER) and accidental releases are expected to be corrected immediately by employees of Mt. Storm Power Station.  Notification of an accidential release will be immediately made to the Grant County LEPC/Emergency Services contact."

      "SummaryText": "DESCRIPTION OF FACILITY AND RELATED PROCESSES:  The Mt. Storm Power Station is an electric utility generating facility, which burns coal and distillate oil  to generate electricity.  The facility will use Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in order to comply with nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions required by U.S. EPA's Regional NOx SIP Call, as implemented through the West Virginia's NOx Budget Trading Program Rule 45CSR26 and EPA's Section 126 Rule.  The SCR process consists of injecting anhydrous ammonia into the boiler flue gas.  The gas then goes through a catalyst bed where the nitrogen oxides react to form nitrogen and water vapor.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:  The worst case release scenario is defined by EPA to be a rupture of one ammonia storage tank, with its entire contents being released as a ten-minute gas release at ground level.  Based on the DEGADIS+ model as distributed through Trinity Consultants' BREEZE HAZ software for calculating the consequences of such a release at 3,825 gal/min (21,750 lbs/min), ammonia could travel as much as 1.97 miles before being diluted to the toxic endpoint. After the US Census Bureau released 2010 data, the population figures were reviewed and found to be still valid.\r\n\r\nALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  A more likely release scenario is a small hole in a flexible transfer hose during tank truck or rail car unloading operations.  The unloading system is equipped with excess flow valves that will stop unloading in the event of total hose failure, however, a small hole in the hose or a gasket may not be automatically detected.  If the hole were 1/4 inch diameter, the ammonia release is estimated to be 30 gal/min (170 lbs/min).  The toxic endpoint for such a scenario is 0.42 miles.  A second alternative scenario with a continuous release through a 1/8 inch diameter hole in a 2 inch transfer line (representing a broken pressure gauge t"
