The facility has a training program, which includes both internal and external emergency responders.\n\nThe emergency release procedures at this facility ensure emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There are also adequate provisions for coordination with outside agencies, such as the North Lawrence Fire Department, the LEPC and OPTECH Environmental Services in the event of an emergency.\n\n2.0    Process Description and Regulated Substance\n\nThe North Lawrence New York Manufacturing Facility produces blended yogurt and cottage cheese.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 31151.  The facility is also capable of packaging yogurt and cottage cheese products.  Several areas of the facility are refrigerated to preserve food products.\n\nAmmonia is the only North Lawrence New York Manufacturing Facility regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.  The quantity of ammonia presently stored on site is 18,500 pounds.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  Its distinctive pungent odor is very noticeable to most people, even in small quantities.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range concentration with a high ignition temperature.  Ammonia is not toxic, but can be corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and at high concentrations can cause burns.  The potential risks of people exposed to an accidental ammonia release include irritation of respiratory tract, burning of the skin and other tissue when contacted by ammonia vapor and freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\n\n3.0    General Accidental Release Pre"

The OSHA PSM program for prevention meets the EPA requirements for a RMP Program 3 Prevention Program and therefore makes the facility compliant with 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe PSM program contains 13 elements, which must be executed:\nEmployee Participation ??A? The purpose of this element is to ensure all employees have a voice in the PSM program and the operations of ammonia related equipment.\nProcess Safety Information ??A? The purpose of this element is to allow all process hazards to be identified and understood by all employees.\nProcess Hazard Analysis ??A? The purpose of this element is to identify, evaluate and control process hazards using a systematic approach.\nOperating Procedures ??A? The purpose of this element is to develop, implement and maintain clear instructions for the safe operation of the ammonia system.\nTraining ??A? The purpose of this element is dependent on role, personnel who may come in contact with ammonia, operate, maintain  or clean ammonia related equipment understand applicable health hazards and be able to perform the work safely.\nContractors - The purpose of this element is to ensure all contractors either directly working on or just in the facility understand the hazards of ammonia.\nPre Start Up Safety Review ??A? The purpose of this element is to ensure the safety and design issues are considered before hazardous materials are introduced to the process or system.\nMechanical Integrity ??A? The purpose of this element is to ensure the continued integrity of the process equipment and minimize the potential for catastrophic release.\nHot Work Permit ??A? The purpose of the element is to ensure fire prevention practices are used for any operation involving open flames, heat or sparks.\nManagement of Change ??A? The purpose of this element is to en"
