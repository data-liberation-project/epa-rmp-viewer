As\n\nsuch, safety during all phases of this process is of utmost\n\nimportance to the ownership, senior management, supervisors, and\n\nemployees.  Continual monitoring is performed by management and\n\nstaff on both, process and personnel, to assure a satisfactory\n\nlevel of safety is being achieved.  Any condition found suspect\n\nis analyzed and corrected.  ABC periodically trains employees as\n\nto the safe handling of chemicals and machinery.  Departure from\n\nestablished safety practices by an employee is not tolerated.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned previously, ABC is involved in the business of\n\nmanufacturing and distributing various cleaners and related\n\nproducts.  Our facility is located within the bounds of the Great\n\nSouthwest Industrial district in Grand Prairie, Texas.  Our\n\n50,000 square feet plant sits upon approximately four acres.  We\n\npackage the cleaners into aerosol cans of various sizes.  A\n\nvariety of chemicals, both hazardous and non-hazardous, are used\n\nin producing the cleaners and other compounds.  Of particular\n\nconcern to the EPA per section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act is the\n\nstorage and usage of approximately two thousand to sixteen\n\nthousand gallons of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).  These gases\n\nare stored in liquid form by pressurization in two certified nine\n\nthousand gallon capacity vessels located on the back lot of the\n\nproperty.  They come in two blends, known generically as A-85 and\n\nA-46.  These blends are naturally occurring hydrocarbons used as\n\nthe aerosol propellant.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario in regards to the LPG vessels\n\nwould be the total release and ignition of the hydrocarbon\n\nblends.  The resulting explosion would have an off-site impact of\n\napproximately 0.3 mile radius.  This is based upon the RMP\n\nc"

ABC, with the counsel and\n\nrecommendations of the Texas Railroad Commission, and local fire\n\ndepartment has installed hardware and safety systems making the\n\nworst case scenario highly unlikely.  The above ground vessels\n\nwith LPG are certified and periodically inspected for integrity\n\nand leaks.  Any signs of potential problems are immediately\n\nrepaired.   All pumps and associated switches used in transfer\n\nprocess are explosion proof.  Emergency shut off switches are\n\nstrategically located, allowing for quick shutdown of the vessel\n\npumps.  High flow water canons surround the vessel and will be\n\nused to deluge the vessels with water to keep them cool in the\n\nevent of an encroaching fire.  Extensive training and care is\n\nused in the area of LPG transfer.\n\n\n\nABC Compounding has demonstrated compliance with Process Safety\n\nManagement.  Thorough analyses of the LPG vessels, process,\n\ntechnology and equipment have been conducted.  Daily visual and\n\naudible inspections are performed on the vessels and piping to\n\ndetect any possible leaks.  If any are found, they repaired\n\nimmediately.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases with respect to the LPG\n\nvessels in the previous ten years, nor in the years before.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program at ABC Compounding begins at the\n\nground level with our employees.  A team of qualified personnel\n\nhave trained in the area of detection and correction of an\n\naccidental release of LPG.  A local emergency response company,\n\nProtect Environmental Service, Inc., is on contact to respond to\n\nany large release of LPG that may occur.  Periodic inspections\n\nand education is provided by the local fire department.  Material\n\nSafety Data Sheets have been provided to the local fire\n\ndepartment in the event of a release and the Local Emergency\n\nPlanning Committee has been sent all required information\n\nincluding the Texas Tier II.\n\n\n\nABC Compounding is constantly participating in any pertinent\n\nsafety or "
