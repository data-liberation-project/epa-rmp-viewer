THE OWNER, MANAGEMANT, AND EMPLOYEES OF RADIUM INC RADIUM MN, ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANU ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, LEPC, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT TRE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\nB. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR APPLICATION ON CROPS AS A FERTILIZER NUTRIENT.\n\nC. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 78,928 POUNDS IN A 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK. (Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of the storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 78,948 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) IS 1.89 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS .83 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nA. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\nB. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nV. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nA. THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDRO"

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nA. THE FACILTY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nB. THE FACILITY HAS PROVIDED TO THE STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n\nC. THE FACILTY HAS A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD 29CFR 1910.120, INCLUDING PRE-EMERGENCY PLANNING AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nA. SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILTY. PERIODIC EVALUATIONS ARE PREFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS AND EVALUATE EMPLOYEE TRAINING. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC ANHYDROUS AMMONIA SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS TIME."
