This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  PSEG Fossil's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe PSEG Fossil - Mercer Generating Station is located on Lamberton Road in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey.  Mercer Generating Station has one regulated toxic substance, aqueous ammonia.  The concentration of ammonia within the solution is between 29.4% and 29.8% by weight.  Aqueous ammonia is utilized as an integral component of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on Units No. 1 and 2 to reduce Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFor Mercer Generating Station, the potential worst-case toxic release scenario involves the entire contents of one aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp model was used to determine that the distance to toxic endpoint for such a release remains within the property boundary and, therefore, does not affect any public or environmental receptors.  The storage facility is equipped with a secondary containment and an underground concrete vault to contain spills.  The vault is designed to mitigate accidental spills and to provide safety for employees and the community. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario analyzed was a break in the transfer hose from a tank truck during the aqueous ammonia unloading.  Also using RMP*Comp, the distance to toxic endpoint remains within the property boundary and, therefore, does not affect any public or env"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \r\n\r\nHAZARD REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe initial Hazard Review of the facility's aqueous ammonia process was performed on March 17-18, 2003.  The review team consisted of engineering, maintenance, operations, safety, and environmental personnel, as well as a team leader and design engineers provided by contractors.  The process hazard analysis method chosen for evaluating the ammonia system was a HazOp.  During the HazOp analysis, the design intent and conditions for each major piece of equipment were identified.  Guide words and potential deviations were postulated for each system.  Possible causes for the deviation were identified along with the potential consequences.  Protective systems or operations to prevent or mitigate the deviation were discussed.  Any deviations that needed to be evaluated further to determine consequences and appropriate protective devices were listed as action items.\r\n\r\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nMercer Generating Station has written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for c"

These procedures will be periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. \r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, PSEG Fossil has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the aqueous ammonia system. All of the training has been documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE\r\n\r\nPSEG Fossil has developed procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. Maintenance personnel have received training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform jobs in a safe manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment is functioning properly.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nPSEG Fossil has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years at Mercer Generating Station.  Since the aqueous ammonia system is a new installation and the facility did not have any other covered processes in the last five years, there have been no reportable accidents involving a covered process at the facility in the last five years. Should an accident occur, it would be investigated to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nPSEG Fossil maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program will be updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes.  The overall emergency response p"

Preventative maintenance is performed to minimize the potential for unanticipated failure of operating equipment.\r\n\r\nPSEG Fossil has reviewed and updated many of the prevention program elements, including written operating procedures, mechanical integrity programs, and the emergency response plan.  Recommendations identified during the hazard review of the aqueous ammonia process equipment and procedures have been incorporated."
