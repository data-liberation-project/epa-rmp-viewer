We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."

      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\n\nThe Praxair facility at Silverbow, MT (outside of Butte) is a facility for the storage and production of nitrogen and hydrogen, for eventual pipeline delivery to an on-site customer, REC Silicon.  Nitrogen is produced by cryogenic separation of air.  Hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas, and is also delivered by truck from remote locations.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in the part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA:  Liquid hydrogen, which is vaporized (converted) to a gas and supplied via pipeline to an on-site customer for the use in silane and polysilicon manufacturing processes.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nPraxair is dedicated to being the bent performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that assure safe operation of our facilities. Praxair is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\nPraxair is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Silverbow, MT facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties \n  of"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\nAt the Silverbow facility, we have installed additional process isolation valves to enhance our capability to shut down the process safely in the event of an incident. We have also upgraded our fire detection system to increase our ability to detect and respond to minor problems before they can become major incidents.\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Silverbow facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\nPraxair has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public"
