If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:\n\n  a.  The primary activity at the facillity is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed.\n\n  B.  The maximum quantity stored would be 168,000 pounds in our two 18,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\n3.  The Worst-case and Alternative Release scenario:\n\n  a.  The worst case release scenario based on the release of the total contents of a storage tank aver a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 87% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.3 miles.\n\n  B.  The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a relief valve.  The distance to endpoint.  (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n   The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requriments for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History:\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past 5 years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."

Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under      \n         SARA Title (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  We conduct yearly safety meetings, safety equipment checks, and check emergency spill equipment procedures.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations at this time."
