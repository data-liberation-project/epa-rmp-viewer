THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF FARMERS COOP ASSN. ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA AND PROPANE. IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH  THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n     - THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS AND PROPANE FOR THE SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n     - ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR BOTH DIRECT APPLICATION  FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS. PROPANE IS ALSO RECEIVED AND STORED FOR DIRECT DELIVERY TO FARMERS.\n\n     - THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORED WOULD BE 720,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO-30,000  GALLON STORAGE TANKS AND NURSE TANKS. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF PROPANE STORED WOULD BE 110,000 POUNDS IN OUR 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK.\n\n3. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n\n     a. THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 140,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT-POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM- IS 1.12 MILES.\n\nFOR PROPANE, THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION CAUSING A 1 PSI OVER PRESSURE TO A DISTANCE OF .43 MILES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 150,000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\n     b. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR AMMONIA IS A 2 MINUTE RELEASE FROM A 3 INCH PIPE BREAK RESULTING IN A DISTANCE"
