      "SummaryText": "The City of Scottsdale (CoS) CAP Water Treatment Plant (WTP) is located on a 42-acre parcel just west of Pima Road on the north side of Union Hills Road.\n\nThe CoS CAP WTP, originally commissioned in 1984, was initially designed to provide a hydraulic capacity of 20 million gallons per day (mgd) and has now increased capacity to approximately 72 mgd. \n\nThe water source for the plant consists of CAP aqueduct water, which includes water from Lake Pleasant. The New Waddell Dam, located at Lake Pleasant on the Aqua Fria River 35 miles northwest of Phoenix, serves as the storage facility for the source water. During a normal operating year, the New Waddell Dam releases Lake Pleasant water from June to September to meet CAP demands and produce hydroelectric power. The release of water from Lake Pleasant to the CAP aqueduct has resulted in significant increases in raw water turbidity and organic content.\n\nThe Risk Management Prevention Program applies only to processes in a stationary source operated by the CoS Water Resources Department that have more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance as defined in the EPA RMP Standard. The only chemical meeting this definition at the CoS CAP WTP is gaseous chlorine in 1-ton containers.  The purpose of the chlorination system at the COS CAP WTP is to provide chlorine for disinfection and to enhance the performance of the various processes at the facility.  Currently, the maximum gaseous chlorine storage amount in the CoS CAP WTP room is 20,000 pounds (approximately 20 1-ton containers).  In addition, the Water Campus Reclamation Plant will be installing an inherently safer technology and ultimately removing gaseous chlorine by Fall 2010.  Therefore, during June 2010, a decision was made to move the remote site 150-pound chlorine cylinder storage (approximately 20 cylinders, ~3000 pounds additional gaseous chlorine) from the Water Campus to the CAP WTP chlorine room.  \n\nPOLICY STATEMENT\n\nThe goals of this Risk Management Pl"

Protect public health and the environment through proper emergency response in the event of a catastrophic release.\n\nAll CoS managers are committed to these goals. This plan has the full approval of management with the authority to commit the necessary resources to implement it in accordance with the requirements of the RMP Standard and the policies of the City. The CoS will provide all funds, labor hours, equipment and materials necessary to fully implement this plan.\n\nEach employee has a vested interest in providing for and assisting with the development and implementation of work practices to protect employee health, welfare and the environment.  All employees are responsible and accountable for safety performance including the responsibility to work safely at all times.\n\nAll CoS personnel have the authority and the obligation to cease any operation that could cause a catastrophic release or an unsafe emergency response.  No operation or work will be started unless it can be performed safely.  Supervisory personnel have the responsibility of directing work in the safest manner possible.\n\nIn addition, all CoS employees are expected to extend the CityA?s concepts and principles to the surrounding community, distributors, suppliers, contractors and residents.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\n\nThe inventory of regulated substances at each stationary source is maintained at the minimum level necessary for operational needs. \n\nAll spare parts and replacement parts for critical equipment meet or exceed the requirements specified for the original parts. All orders for these spare parts and replacement parts are approved by the responsible manager and/or designated employee prior to purchase.\n\nAll of the processes covered in this plan are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and therefore to the A?Program 3A? requirements of the EPA RMP Standard and this plan.

      "SummaryText": " of the prevention requirements of A?A?68.65 through 68.87 have been implemented and are fully described in the CoS Water Resources written plan.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nThe City of Scottsdale Water Resource Department has a fully developed and implemented emergency response and evacuation program for the purpose of protecting public health and the environment. At a high level, the program includes:\n\n1. An emergency response plan that is maintained at each location and contains at least: procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases; documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; and procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance;\n\n2. Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment\n\n3. Training for all employees in relevant procedures; and\n\n4. Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at each location and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe emergency response plan has been coordinated with the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003. Upon request of the Maricopa County LEPC or the Arizona Emergency Response Commission of the ADEQ Emergency Response Unit emergency response officials, the City shall promptly provide them the necessary information for developing and implementing the community emergency response plan.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the entire operational existence of all of the covered processes in this plan, no accidental releases have ever occurred as outlined by A? 68.42 of the RMP Standard to be included in any five year accident history. \n\nPLANNED SAFETY CHANGES\n\nThere is a Mid-term goal (2-4 years) of implementing an inherently safer technology to eliminate the CoS CAP WTP gaseous chlorine, in lieu of funding approvals and subsequent implementation/construction.\n \n"
