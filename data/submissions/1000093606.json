Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention / mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include; personnel training, safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation / operation / maintenance of our processes.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\r\n\t\r\n         DESCRIPTION OF THE COX CITY NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\t\r\nThe Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant, located approximately 9 miles east and 2 miles north of Rush Springs in Grady County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration assist to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas - primarily methane - and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Cox City gas plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\u00bf\tV-200 Condensate Flash Tank comprised of a C1+ mixture.\r\n\t\r\nThis process vessel was selected due to having the greatest inventory and endp"

In addition to following the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP), the Cox City Plant follows applicable laws set forth in Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\r\n\t\r\n         OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\t\r\nUnder the RMP regulations, the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant is classified as a Program Level 3 facility.  Under Program Level 3 guidelines, the Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing the C1+ mixture.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 80% of the maximum tank capacity.  However, for Worst Case Scenario calculations, the 100% inventory of this tank is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this WCS is 599 yards or 0.3403 miles.  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating the WCS for the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant.\r\n\t\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Cox City gas plant is a VCE involving a sixty-minute release of C1+ mixture following a seal failure on the condensate stabilizer feed pump.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this event is 45 yards or 0.026 miles.\r\n\t\r\n         GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\t\r\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention p"

Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.

This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\t\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are reviewed with corporate management to approve or revise recommended mitigation actions.  Once approved, mitigation actions are assigned a relative risk ranking based upon the magnitude / immediacy of necessary actions to reduce hazard risks - as deemed necessary by the PHA Team, PHA Team Leader, and/or Corporate Management. This risk reduction ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All management-approved PHA Team recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\t\r\nPeriodically, the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant updates and revalidates the initial PHA to ensure that process controls remain technologically adequate, and that process hazards are minimized and are within acceptable company risk tolerances.  The PHA Revalidation verifies that the process does not deviate significantly from its original engineering design and safety features.  These periodic revalidations / reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is decommissioned.  As with the initial analysis, the PHA Team findings / recommendations will be forwarded to corporate management for approval / revi"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\t\r\nIn addition, the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant maintains Operating Procedures and/or process safety information that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\t\r\n         Training\r\n\t\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Cox City Natural Gas Processing Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skill"
