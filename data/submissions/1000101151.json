Because it is Veolia's business to receive the chemicals as wastes for safe management, elimination and substitution are not applicable.\n\nTo minimize the risk of an accidental release using engineering controls, Veolia designed the process to utilize top loading with a stinger to fill the railcars, which reduces the risk posed by a release from the bottom valve of the railcar. Secondary containment is in place for the pumping operation. The buildup of static electricity is prevented by using conductive hoses and the electrical bonding of tank trucks, pumps, and railcars. To minimize vapor releases, vapors are balanced between the tanker and railcar. High-level alarms are present on the railcars (activate at 90% full), to prevent overfilling.\n\nAdministrative controls implemented to minimize the risk of an accidental release include:\n    Standard Operating Procedures with job safety analysis for each part of the process. \n    Inspection programs covering equipment, materials, and processes to identify and correct deficiencies. \n    Hazardous Materials Management Plan that includes fire prevention and control requirements.\n    Comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures.

The facility receives waste materials transported to the site via tank trucks of primarily organic solvent wastes from various manufacturers. Once on-site, the waste materials are consolidated into various railcars depending on how the material will be processed. Hazardous Wastes are shipped to Veolia or 3rd party facilities for treatment or disposal. Other materials suitable for use as feedstock are shipped to industrial customers as a product. \n\n\nThere will be one process at the railyard that can store a regulated chemical (piperidine) in quantity sufficient to require the preparation and implementation of this Risk Management Plan (RMP). The process will be performed on an event basis for one year, and Veolia will terminate this RMP plan at the end of the year. \n\nThe RMP regulated process involves the transloading of dimethylformamide (DMF) containing up to 7% piperidine from tank trucks delivered to the facility into railcars, with the heaviest car weighing 206,500 lbs. Once complete, Veolia will ship railcars off-site.   \n\n\nAt most, 16,000 pounds per railcar and 52,080 pound total piperidine may be present on-site in the DMF transloading process.
