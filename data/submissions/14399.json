AND Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management legislation: California Code of Regulations Title 8, section 5189.\n\nThe Monterey County Department of Health has evaluated the Carmel Area WasteWater District's WasteWater Treatment Facility for the risk that it poses to the surrounding community from an accidental release of the acutely hazardous material - CHLORINE GAS. The CAWD facility was ranked relative to all other facilities in Monterey County which handle acutely hazardous materials pursuant to the requirements of California Health and Safety Code Section 25534 (b).  Based upon the evaluation, the CAWD facility was ranked #14 out of 137 facilities (#1 being the highest risk).\n\nAn extensive program was originally developed in 1992 to meet the requirements of the Risk Management Prevention Program requirements, using the Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methodology and an Offsite Consequence Analysis.  The document was reviewed and modified to accomodate Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements in 1997.  Plant safety regulations with regard to process management were not significantly changed to accomodate the new law, as CAWD already had in practice the highest level of safety management possible with existing equipment.  Members of the public are welcome to call the treatment plant at 831-624-1249 at any time to request tours/visits to the facility or to review safety documentation at the treatment facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Description\n\nChlorine System:  Overview and process chemistry.\n\nGaseous chlorine is stored in a building at the western boundary of this facility in 1-ton containers.

This chlorine is injected into treated wastewater at several points within the CAWD WasteWater Treatment Facility, resulting in a chemical mixture of water, free chlorine, and bound chlorine in a concentration of approximately 10 parts per million.  The purposes of the chlorine are to:\n\nDisinfect Secondary Effluent prior to ocean discharge or tertiary treatment,\nDisinfect Tertiary Effluent prior to reuse,\nDisinfect Return Activated Sludge to control nuisance organism growth in MLSS,\nDisinfect Plant influent flow to control odors and oxidize organics.\n\nThe points of injection are as follows:\n\nChlorine contact tank, (Effluent Disinfection)\nEffluent pump station, (Emergency Effluent Disinfection)\nReturn Activated Sludge sump, (Nuisance Organism Control)\nCAWD/PBCSD trunk manhole, (Odor Control & Organics Oxidation)\nInfluent Pump Station manhole, (Odor Control & Organics Oxidation)\nHeadworks manhole, (Odor Control & Organics Oxidation)\n\nThe source of chlorine to all of the above points of injection is the chlorine storage, injection,  and distribution system located within the Chlorination / Dechlorination structure located at the western most boundary of the facility. All vacuum ejectors supplying the six control points are located within the contained structure as well. Chlorine is transported to the points of injection in a 15 mg/l (approximate) chlorine/water solution. Chlorine gas or liquid does not leave the chlorination/dechlorination structure except as a solution. \n\nChlorine System Components:\n\nThe chlorine storage system consists of the following components:\n\nOne to eight on-line liquid chlorine cylinders ( 2000 pounds each),\nFour flexible couplings (pigtails),\nTwo pressure gauges with diaphragm seals,\nTwo filters,\nFour scale gauges (cylinder weight),\nTwo pressure switches,\nTwo 1\" line valves,\nTwo automatic switchover, vacuum regulator check valves,\nTwo vacuum gauges,"

As each tank is drawn empty, the automatic switchover vacuum regulator aligns the next full cylinder with the header. If loss of vacuum occurs at any point downstream of the switchover valve, the regulator automatically isolates the chlorine cylinders and header from the distribution system. Items #1 through #10 listed under Section B, chlorine storage system,  are shown on this detailed drawing. \n\nChlorine distribution system as contained within the chlorination/dechlorination structure: Plant effluent pumped through the chlorine ejectors induces a vacuum which draws the chlorine from the chlorine header. Chlorine gas is mixed with the effluent creating a 15 to 20 mg/l chlorine solution which is piped to the various points of injection.\n\n\nChlorine System Safety Features:\n\nThe chlorine system has been designed with specific features to safeguard against the accidental release of chlorine gas or liquid. These features include:\n\nAll chlorine cylinders stored at the chlorine building are held securely in high impact resistant trunions, which are set in concrete, and are held securely to the trunions by high tensile strength webbed belts and "

      "SummaryText": "by a computerized tracking system. \n\n\nHazard Identification\n\n\nChlorine exists as a gas at standard pressure and temperature conditions. Chlorine gas is 2.5 times as dense as air, and thus, is likely to form clouds at the ground surface. Although classified as a nonflammable gas, chlorine may cause fire on contact with combustible materials as a result of the heat released when highly reactive chlorine combines with those materials. Chlorine forms hydrochloric acid upon contact with water and becomes extremely corrosive (therefore water must never be used in the presence of a chlorine leak).  The primary health hazards consist of effects on the respiratory system of hydrochloric acid, including severe irritation and possible severe injury of eyes, throat, and lungs.  Formation of HCl not only causes respiratory damage but corrodes the opening of the leak, causing the leak to increase in volume.   Inhalation of chlorine gas may also result in death from suffocation.   MSDS sheets for chlorine are located in the chlorine building, and in the plant office (master MSDS book).  \n\n\nA significant liquid chlorine release, slug release, at the CAWD WasteWater Treatment Facility could occur as a result, and only as a result,  of extensive damage to a chlorine cylinder. This could occur as a result of an accident during maintenance activities in the vicinity of the storage rooms, as a result of operator error during handling, or as a result of an external event such as an earthquake. The likelihood of a significant rupture is not probable as indicated by the lack of such occurrences within the industrial community. Nevertheless, for the purposes of further evaluation, the liquid release scenario is the rupture or damage to one or more of the four chlorine cylinders resulting in the release of the entire liquid contents of X number of cylinders - (X x 2000 lbs/cylinder). In the case of a puncture in the liquid phase of the cylinder, liquid will be expelled through the hole until"

      "SummaryText": " the liquid level drops to the lip of the opening. Most of the liquid expelled will evaporate or \"flash off\" as it comes out of the tank, but some may spill on the ground. The evaporation rate of the spilled liquid depends on heat input from the ground and from the sun. It should be noted that at standard conditions, the weight of one volume of liquid chlorine equals the weight of 456.5 volumes of chlorine gas. The boiling point of liquid chlorine at one atmospheric unit of pressure is -33.97 :C (-29.15 :F). \n\n\nA significant gaseous chlorine release could occur in the portions of the chlorine storage and supply systems where chlorine exists in the gaseous state under pressure. In the case of a puncture or leak in the upper (vapor) phase of the cylinder or the cylinder supply pigtail to the chlorine header, about one-fourth of the liquid (depending upon liquid temperature) remaining in the cylinder will rapidly flash off. This will cool the remaining liquid to the atmospheric boiling point. The evaporation rate of the remaining liquid primarily depends on the heat input from the atmosphere. It is very possible that the atmospheric temperature surrounding the leak will drop low enough to freeze atmospheric moisture around the leak effectively sealing the leak. In the case of a chlorine vapor leak from the chlorine supply header, the installed vacuum/pressure sensor will immediately shut, isolating the leak.As a means of reducing risk associated with the use of acutely hazardous materials (AHM's) at the Carmel Area WasteWater District's Treatment Facility, the Carmel Area WasteWater District has implemented a number of measures as part of the design of the chlorine system and as part of the facility's standard operating and maintenance procedures.

CAWD staff personnel assist the technicians when applicable so as to facilitate in-house maintenance when necessary. In between scheduled maintenance routines, the AHM equipment is inspected daily to ascertain levels of equipment integrity. All other non-electronic equipment AHM equipment such as valving and piping, is maintained as per manufacturers specifications. Additionally, equipment such as the chlorine leak detector is tested on no less than a monthly basis to insure equipment functionality.  \n\n\n\nExternal Events:\n\nExternal events such as earthquakes or flooding represent a special problem for facilities of this type as it is impossible to predict their frequency or magnitude. No amount of engineering will prevent the release of an AHM if an earthquake measured at 9.5 occurs. As is noted in previous sections, much thought has gone into designing the chlorine storage room so as to abridge the likelihood of a release of an AHM  in a semi-managable catastrophe. To avoid compounding the problem, no flammable material is stored in the chlorine storage room which is constructed solely of concrete and steel. This measure eliminates the possibility of a fire rupturing the chlorine cylinders. Furthermore, the cylinders themselves are designed to execute a controlled release of chlorine, rather than a cylinder explosion, in the event of a fire.  If cylinders are engulfed in flames, chlorine leakage is certain, and water shall not be used for firefighting.

The ultimate goal in this particular circumstance is to encourage that staff adopt an acute awareness of unsafe operating practices where AHM's are concerned. Operator error could result from several causes including not following proper procedures or inadequate training.
