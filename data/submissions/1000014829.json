The facility produces fresh and frozen seafood products, using anhydrous ammonia in a closed system as a refrigerant in freezers and chillers.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  In calculating worst-case and alternative scenarios, efforts were made in all cases to overestimate rather than underestimate the effects of a release.  The facility system was recently expanded, which may bring it over the threshold quantity for Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning purposes.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nA worst-case scenario is required to be documented in the RMP.  Based on the requirements of the RMP rule, it is assumed that the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel in the system results in the release of its entire contents over a 10-minute period.  The release is modeled using RMP*Comp software. \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the ammonia refrigeration process is based on a potential hazard that is possible at the facility.  In this scenario, a safety relief valve fails, releasing ammonia gas to the atmosphere.  As this valve is designed to relieve to the outdoors, no mitigation is considered in the scenario calculations.  The release is evaluated according to the procedures documented in General Risk Management Program Guidance (April 2004), Appendix E Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Facilities and modeled with RMP*Comp software.\n\n\n\nThere have not been any actual incidents with offsite conse"

      "SummaryText": "quences and the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was not complete at the time of the preparation of this RMP as the plant has not yet exceeded the threshold limit quantity, therefore an actual incident or hazard identified specifically in the PHA could not be chosen.  It is expected that this scenario will be analyzed in the PHA.\n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program \n\nIcicle Seafoods, Inc. has implemented a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many safety features built in including high and low level controls and alarms, high pressure shut downs, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves, check valves, and leak detectors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There have been no such incidents at the facility in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan per 29 CFR 1910.38 to facilitate safe response to accidental ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to assist in evacuation, make required notifications, and conduct the necessary actions to help ensure employee and community safety during an emergency"
