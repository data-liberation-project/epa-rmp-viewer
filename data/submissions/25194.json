The maximum quantitiy released would be 52,250 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point is 2.6 miles.  Randolph Fertilizer Co., has all excess flow devices, Emergency Shut off valves and breakaway valves in place, required by th ANSI Standards and State Requirements.  These will help limit exposure in a release situation.                                                                                                                                                               \n\nThe alternate release scenario, a 3 inch trasfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release  of ammonia for a 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or remote m"
