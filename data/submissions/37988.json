The facility operates 24 hours a day, three hundred and sixty five days a year.\n\nThe site consists of 155 acres, of which 39 acres are filled with river dredging and are currently developed.\n\nThere is a 720-foot dock of wood construction on the Columbia River.   All activities on this dock are controlled and regulated by the United States Coast Guard, who has issued the facility a certificate of adequacy for reception facilities.\n\nRegulated Substances\nThere are 141 regulated substances by the RPM.   Of these, only acetaldehyde is present on the plant site above its threshold quantity (10,000 pounds).\n\nAcetaldehyde is used in the manufacture of Cinnamon oil (cinnamic aldehyde) which is the major component of cinnamon flavoring.   The maximum amount of acetaldehyde on the plant site is limited to 46,872 pounds (7,200 gallons), which is 90% of the volume of its storage tank. \n\n\nRegulated Process Description\nAcetaldehyde is purchased in single tank truckload shipments and is off loaded using nitrogen into the nitrogen padded, insulated storage tank.   The acetaldehyde is blended with another raw material in a mix tank one batch at a time, and then the mixture is fed to a reactor where it is converted into cin"

This review yielded a 50% tank level.   Therefore, the Alternate Release Scenario was found to be a BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion) of the acetaldehyde storage tank, containing 23,436 pounds (3,600 gallons) of acetaldehyde, caused by a fire impinging on the non-insulated, outside wall of the tank.   Using the formula dictated by the EPA's RMP rule the resulting BLEVE would have an offsite impact.\n\nAdministrative Controls to Limit the Impact Distance\nPrior to making any transfers into or out of the tank the operator is to inspect the tank, transfer lines, and the receiving vessel for integrity to insure that there are no worn or damaged parts.   In addition, the operator is to check that the receiving vessel has the empty space in it to receive the full amount of the intended transfer quantity without going over 90% in the receiving tank.\n\nDuring tank truck offloading and transfer operations an operator has to be present walking around inspecting for leaks.\n\nThere is a mechanical integrity program at the facility that checks and tests the instrumentation and loss prevention systems (i.e. PSV, fire valve, fire suppression systems, fire water supply system, vessel and pipe thickness testing, etc.)\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program exists at the facility, which assesses the process every time there is a change and every five years if there are no changes.\n\nThere is a Management of Change (MOC) system at the facility, which insures that when a revision of any kind is done with respect to this process (no matter how minor a change) everything is reviewed and changed as necessary.   This includes, but not limited to, all engineering, all process safety information, all procedures, all training, all reporting, all notification, all documentation, and all auditing. \n\nThe facility has a Spill Containment and Cou"

Currently this training program maintains individuals at the technician level HAZWOPER, Incident Commander level and Awareness level.   In addition to this hazardous materials training, the facility has a Process Safety Management training program, required by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations that keeps each operational employee current in their individual job classification requirements.\n\nMitigation Measures to Limit the Impact Distance\nThe tank is designed such that both the filling and discharge activities are through the same line.   A fusible link fire valve is installed in this line just prior to its attachment to the tank.   Then, should a fire start during either of these activities, the fusible link will fail allowing the valve to shut, closing off the fuel source, which in turn stops the fire by stopping the flow of fuel. \n\nA fire system monitor, capable of delivering 700 gallons per minute, is located approximately 150 feet from the tank for cooling the tank to prevent vessel failure.\n\nThe tank is completely wrapped in insulation to protect the tank from flame impingement.   \n\nThe tank supports are designed per the applicable NFPA codes for horizontal storage tanks used for the storage of flammable materials to prevent them from failing in the event a fire should occur. \n\nThe tank sits inside of a dike, which is designed to contain the contents of the tank plus room for holding normal rainfall. \n\nAll plant operational personnel are trained in defensive, tank cooling, fire hose tactics.\n\nGeneral and Chemical Specific Accidental Release Prevention Steps\nTo limit the impact distance, prior to making any transf"
