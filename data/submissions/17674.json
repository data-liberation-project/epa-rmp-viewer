This facility maintains a 4,000 pound chlorine system for treatment of wastewater effluent.  Based on criteria specified in 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the source is classified as Program III.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for this facility, as specified in the CAA, is a release of approximately 4,000 pounds of chlorine within 10 minutes followed by vapor cloud dispersion.  The radius of influence to the specified endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is 1.3 miles based on modeling using RMP*Comp. \n\nThe alternative scenario involves the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine due to a cross-threaded coupling after container replacement.  The release, if unnoticed by the operator, would occur over approximately 60 minutes, followed by plume dispersion.  Based upon Class B atmospheric conditions the toxic vapor cloud is predicted to extend 0.7 miles (1,191 yards) based on the ALOHA modeling program. \n\nBoth scenarios affect offsite receptors.  There are no administrative controls in use that could reduce the predicted effects, however, the chlorine system is contained within a building which serves to impede the rate of dispersion of the gas and connected to a functional alarm system which will be responded to by the HazMat Team.\n\nThere have been no incidents involving the chlorine system in the last five years which presented any threat of personnel or property damage on or off the site.\n\nRabun Apparel maintains a Technician Level HazMat Team and will respond to emergency releases in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER).  The Dillard Volunteer Fire Department will be summoned by 911 to provide logistical support.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis of this system is conducted at least once every five years by Rabun Apparel personnel in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.
