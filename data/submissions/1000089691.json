Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nThe ChampionX Corsicana Plant (Corsicana), has always had a strong commitment to its employees to provide a safe working environment. This policy is consistent with both the spirit and the intent of our commitment.  The safety of employees, company operations, and the public are management's most important complete compliance with all safety regulations and safety policies.\r\n\r\nEvery attempt will be made to reduce the possibility of accident occurrence by all levels of management. ChampionX Corsicana believes that safety, like quality and housekeeping, can be controlled by motivated supervision.  Therefore, preventable lost time accidents will have an impact on a supervisor's annual salary review, including any bonuses and incentive plans.  Unreported accidents will be considered falsification of company records and will result in immediate discharge.  Lost time accident free locations will be eligible for annual awards.\r\n\r\n2.  The Station Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nChampionX Corsicana operates a specialty chemical plant and manufactures fatty amines and nitrile intermediates.  The principal products are emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, de-emulsifiers, and surfactants.\r\n\r\nWe have nine regulated substances present at our facility as raw materials for processes, which include dimethylamine (DMA), acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen, formaldehyde, methyl chloride (MeCl), epichlorohydrin, trimethylamine (TMA), and hydrochloric acid (HCl).  Acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, formaldehyde, epichlorohydrin, methyl chloride, and hydrochloric acid are regulated as toxic chemicals and trimethylamine, hydrogen, and dimethylamine are regulated as flammable chemicals. The quantity of hydrogen at this facility is below the threshold level of 10,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n \r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specifi"
