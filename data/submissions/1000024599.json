Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nMcEntire Produce primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if checklist analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nMcEntire Produce maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, (6) initial sta"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, McEntire Produce maintains Operating Procedures that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, McEntire Produce has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training for their job tasks. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. - through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors\r\nMcEntire Produce uses contractors to supplement its work force during period of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, McEntire Produce evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR\u00bfs)\r\nMcEntire Produce conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure those safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment is appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems is operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nMcEntire Produce has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. - adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, as well as process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, is updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nMcEntire Produce promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u00bfs findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA\u00bfs and PHA revalidations.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program"

      "SummaryText": "is functioning properly, McEntire Produce conducts periodic internal compliance audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are scheduled at least every 3 years. Audit findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Management is in charge of the corrective actions taken in response to the audit and also to track them until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe processes at McEntire Produce have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility. \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all processes at McEntire Produce. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\nMcEntire Produce has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\r\na.\tRelease Detection\r\nb.\tRelease Containment/Control\r\nc.\tProcess Relief Valves\r\nd.\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\ne.\tAutomatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g.- high temperature)\r\nf.\tCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\ng.\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation\r\nh.\tAtmospheric relief devices\r\ni.\tRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\nTrained Emergency Response Personnel\r\nPersonal protective equipment (e.g. - chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nAccident History\r\nMcEntire Produce has an excel"
