FACILITY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nHYDERA, LLC is an ISO storage yard located at the Charleston International Manufacturing Center (CIMC) in Goose Creek, South Carolina.  The tank containers to be stored are primarily intermodal containers manufactured according to the specifications outlined by the International Organization for Standardization (\"ISO containers\") and may also include tank trailers and totes.\n\n\n\nCIMC is owned and managed by Cooper River Partners (CRP) who provides services to nine independent companies located at CIMC. The manufacturing operations include dyes and optical brighteners for the paper and detergent industries, chemical additives for the rubber industry, photographic film, pigments for the apparel industry, steel fabrication and welding, and a tire grade precipitated silica.\n\n\n\nCIMC, previously known as Bushy Park Industrial Complex, was established in 1970 and is located on 1650 acres on the Cooper River just a few miles east of Goose Creek, S C.  The facility has over 800 employees.  A significant economic benefit is realized by the local area, county, and state because of CIMC business and operations, including those of HYDERA.  \n\n\n\nII. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nHYDERA is committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of HYDERA employees, customers, and surrounding communities.  It is HYDERA's policy to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and to establish and implement responsible practices where laws and regulations do not exist.  Further, HYDERA will work with government and industry groups to foster the development of appropriate health, environment and safety programs, laws and regulations.  HYDERA will communicate with its employees, customers, suppliers, communities and the public to recognize and respond to their concerns and to improve their understanding of the health, environment and safety considerations related "

The CAP meets regularly to discuss safety and environmental issues and serves as a voice for the community to provide feed back to HYDERA in relation to community matters.\n\n\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n\n\n\nHYDERA will participate in the Berkeley County Local Emergency Planning Committee and will actively work with the county, local agencies and response groups to provide information about operations and the chemicals stored on site.  In addition, the site emergency plans have been provided to the local hospital, fire department, LEPC, and Sheriff's Department.  The site emergency response team participates in disaster drills held annually, and often trains with other off-site and local response organizations as well as other private industry personnel.\n\n\n\nCompliance and Commitment to Safety\n\n\n\nHYDERA is highly committed to the safety and health of our personnel and community.  As part of this dedication to safety, we are constantly seeking feedback from our team and neighbors to help innovate and implement new procedures that allow us to maintain these high standards.  Our existing safeguards are above the industrial standards and will ensure that all chemicals are handled safety in storage, handling and within our processes.  We also work closely with our suppliers, neighboring companies, consultants, local officials, and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs to minimize risks.\n\n\n\nHYDERA has developed a risk management plan in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must "

Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\n\n\nMany chemicals stored by HYDERA are also regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  HYDERA is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\n\n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nHYDERA's storage yard contains multiple RMP chemicals, both flammables (2) and toxics (3).  All chemicals are stored on concrete in ISO containers, pending shipment to the vessel's final destination. \n\n\n\nIV. RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nA worst case and alternative (more likely) scenario was evaluated using RMP*Comp for each RMP listed chemical stored on site above the threshold quantity.  While the worst case was based on the complete failure of the largest container, the alternative scenario is a hypothetical release that is more realistic than the loss of the entire container.  It is important to note that the impact areas defined using RMP*Comp for each chemical release did not consider active mitigation measures that would be performed by trained plant personnel and emergency responders in the event of a release. \n\n\n\nTrimethylchlorosilane (TMCS)\n\n\n\nThe \"worst-case\" scenario is based on the complete failure of the largest container containing TMCS which would release 7,000 gallons of TMCS in 12.1 minutes.  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint, assuming liquid temperature of 105 degrees F, is 16.0 miles.\n\n\n\nThe most likely release scenario of TMCS involves a container sitting in storage with a 5 mm (0.25 cm2) leak from a flange gasket at the top outlet valve of the ISO vessel.  A realistic, yet conservative estimate of the ISO tank pressure is 1 bar (14.7 psi).  A release duration of 2 hours was chosen based on the time it"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nIn the past five years, HYDERA has not experienced any release of a covered chemical that requires listing in the RMP submission.  \n\n\n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\n\n\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\n\n\n\nHYDERA has multiple safeguards in place to ensure the safe storage and handling of all covered chemicals on-site and to prevent releases.  First and foremost, our goal is to prevent any release from occurring.   In the unlikely event a release occurs, we have procedures in place to contain the release quickly and to minimize its impact on plant personnel and neighbors. If a release occurs:\n\n\n\n    The plant alarm would be sounded, and all plant personnel notified over the site PA system;\n\n    On-site emergency response teams would respond and take action to stop the release; \n\n    Emergency response personnel would evaluate the extent and impact of the release;\n\n    If the release traveled off-site, local and county em"

Some examples of our preparation and training include:\n\n    Written procedures to handle all types of emergencies;\n\n    Regularly scheduled safety training for all personnel involved with covered chemical operations;\n\n    Trained on-site emergency response teams; \n\n    Emergency planning sessions with the local fire department and county emergency personnel;\n\n    Participation in annual county disaster drills;\n\n    Routine testing of plant emergency response, alerting, and communications systems;\n\n    Fully equipped emergency response vehicles; and \n\n    Certified Hazmat Team to respond to off-site transportation and distribution incidents.\n\n\n\nVII. RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION \n\n\n\nAssuring Safe Operations\n\n\n\nHYDERA has established programs and activities to ensure safe operation of its systems.  Some examples include: \n\n    Personnel trained in the safe operations;\n\n    Operating and maintenance procedures in place; \n\n    Hazard and operability studies conducted routinely; \n\n    Safety reviews conducted prior to making any changes to the operation or equipment;\n\n    Health, environmental, and safety audits conducted to ensure compliance with regulations;\n\n    Maintenance work planned ahead of time and work permits issued to assure work is done safely;\n\n    Equipment, instruments, and piping regularly inspected to ensure integrity of the system; and\n\n    All incidents investigated and action taken to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nDesigning for Safety\n\n\n\nHYDERA has multiple safeguards and systems to reduce the likelihood of incidents, including:\n\n\n\n    Equipment built to industry standards; \n\n    Instruments "
