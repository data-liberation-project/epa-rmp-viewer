      "SummaryText": "At the Warren Water Filtration Plant, chlorine, a chemical considered to be hazardous the US EPA is utilized. The properties of chlorine make it valuable for disinfecting drinking water for human consumption. Since chlorine is a hazardous chemical, the Warren Water Filtration Plant adheres to the safe handling and proper reporting procedures of the US EPA SARA Title III, the OSHA Process Safety Management directives, and the OSHA HAZWOPER Standard.\n\nSARA Title III requires our plant to meet the directives of their Chemical Emergency Preparedness Program. SARA Title III allows our plant to function within the Trumbull County Local Emergency Planning Commission, and to utilize their resources if needed to aid us in abating a hazardous material release. \n\nSARA TITLE III directives include: \n?    Inventory (Tier) reporting\n?    Forwarding of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) to all applicable agencies\n?    Utilization of proper reporting procedures in the event of a release of chlorine\n\nOur chlorine facility is equipped with numerous safety features including alarms, and a scrubber. Employees have been trained to mitigate small releases (<1ppm). Our plant shall utilize the services of the Warren FD and the Trumbull County LEPC to abate a hazardous substance release (>1ppm). \n\nDuring the last five years no accidents or releases have occurred.\n\nEnd of Executive Summary."
