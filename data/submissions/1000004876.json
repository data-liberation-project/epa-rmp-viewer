The facility operates 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  The site consists of 155 acres, 39 of which are developed.\n\nAcetaldehyde is the only material present on the plant site above the threshold quantity for RMP planning (10,000 pounds).  Acetaldehyde is used in the manufacture of flavoring and/or frangrance products.  The maximum quantity of acetaldehyde is limited by administrative procedures and storage capacity.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would result in an off-site impact.  Administrative controls and mitigation measures such as operating procedures and emergency response programs are in place to limit the impact distance and severity.  Alternative release scenarios were considered via Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in accordance with PSM regulations.  The facility has an emergency response plan designed to respond to and mitigate the release scenarios identified in the PHA.  The plan has been reviewed and modified as necessary to coordinate with the community's emergency response plan.\n\nThere have been no events involving acetaldehyde at the facility in the RMP reporting history."
