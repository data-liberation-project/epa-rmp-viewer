We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected the sulfur dioxide system.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\nPDMI has  installed an active mitigation system which routes any release of SO2 through a system designed to capture and neutralize the SO2.  This active mitigation measure is not required to prevent a release of sulfur dioxide from affecting public receptors; however, it will make the system safer."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at our facility:\nThis facility complies with all Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) guidelines as well as other safety and environmental protection standards set forth by regulations and permit requirements.  It is Phelps Dodge Morenci Inc.'s. (PDMI's) policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur with the anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2) system, it is PDMI's policy to notify the Morenci Fire Association and other appropriate local agencies and request that they respond to the emergency as necessary.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:\nPDMI operates an open pit copper mine, ore processing and copper extraction facilities located in Greenlee County, Arizona.  PDMI uses SO2 to improve copper recovery efficiency in the ore processing facilities.  This is the only substance used at this facility that is reported under the risk management program rule.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\nPDMI's worst-case scenario evaluated the failure of one 12,000-gallon SO2 storage tank when filled.  The tank is surrounded by a concrete berm and is enclosed in an 11,250-ft3 building.  Both the building and containment measures were assumed to be passive mitigation.  Based on EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis the distance to endpoint in a urban (obstructed terrain) setting, typical of the terrain surrounding the site, is 0.3 miles.  Using the rural setting (unobstructed terrain), the distance to endpoint is 0.7 miles.  The worst-case release scenario from both the urban and rural settings would not affect any public receptors beyond PDMI's property boundary.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The SO2"
