All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\r\n\r\n* Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\r\n\r\n* Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same level of safety training that the City provides for its own employees.\r\n\r\n* Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all inspections.\r\n\r\n* Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\r\n\r\n* Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\r\n\r\n* Stringent investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases.\r\n\r\n* Development of a plant-specific emergency action plan.\r\n\r\n* Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\r\n\r\n* Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\r\n\r\nCity staff utilizes its Emergency Action Plan to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the unlikely event of an accidental release.

Since 1958 the plant has been expanded several times to its current design capacity of 14.0 million gallons per day.  The VWRF provides secondary treatment followed by effluent filtration, chlorination/dechlorination and discharge to the Santa Clara River Estuary.  Effluent wildlife ponds are used for storage of chlorinated effluent prior to discharge.  A portion of the effluent is reused for irrigation.\r\n\r\nVWRF employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas and a dechlorination facility utilizing sulfur dioxide.  The facility is equipped with chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors and chlorine and sulfur dioxide scrubber systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA\u00bfS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe VWRF uses the following chemicals that are stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program:\r\n\r\nChlorine \u00bf One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier.  A maximum of 30 one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide \u00bf One-ton cylinders of liquid sulfur dioxide are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier.  A maximum of 4 one-ton cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\r\n\r\nThe VWRF facility has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe VWRF facility is subject to OSHA\u00bfs Pr"
