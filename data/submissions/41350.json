Since 1958 the plant has been expanded several times to its current design capacity of 14.0 million gallons per day.  The VWRF provides secondary treatment followed by effluent filtration, chlorination/dechlorination and discharge to the Santa Clara River Estuary.  Effluent wildlife ponds are used for storage of chlorinated effluent prior to discharge.  A portion of the effluent is reused for irrigation.\n\n\n\nVWRF employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas and a dechlorination facility utilizing sulfur dioxide.  The facility is equipped with chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors and chlorine and sulfur dioxide scrubber systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA?S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe VWRF uses the following chemicals that are stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n\n\nChlorine ? One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier.  A maximum of 30 one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide ? One-ton cylinders of liquid sulfur dioxide are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier.  A maximum of 4 one-ton cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\n\n\nThe VWRF facility has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe VWRF facility is subject to OSHA?s Pr"

      "SummaryText": "ocess Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with its chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  The City has developed a PSM safety program to minimize the potential for an accidental release.  The PSM safety program includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n* Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n\n \n\n* Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures.  All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n\n\n\n* Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n\n\n\n* Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same level of safety training that the City provides for its own employees.\n\n\n\n* Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all inspections.\n\n\n\n* Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n\n\n\n* Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n\n\n\n* Stringent investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases.\n\n\n\n* Development of a plant-specific emergency action plan.\n\n\n\n* Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n\n\n\n* Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nCity staff utilizes its Emergency Action Plan to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the unlikely event of an accidental release.  The key elements of the Emergency Action Plan are as follows:\n\n\n\n* All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n\n\n\n* The chlorine bui"

The gas detectors have an audible alarm, automatically activate the emergency scrubber, and alert the City?s central operations control room.\n\n\n\n* A team of engineers, supervisors and operators are trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials (Hazmat) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\n\n\n\n* In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact the City of San Buenaventura Fire Department.  The Fire Department and the plant?s HazMat team would jointly conduct emergency response and repair the leak.  City staff members are trained in first aid procedures.  \n\n\n\n\n\nCITY?S RECENT STEPS TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn connection with process and safety improvements, the facility has upgraded its sulfur dioxide handling system to a vacuum feed system and will soon upgrade the chlorine feed to a similar system. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile execww2004.doc  (Revised June 2004)\n\n"
