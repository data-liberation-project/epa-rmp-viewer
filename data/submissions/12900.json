Facility Policy.\n \n The owners, management and employees of ENTER COMPANY NAME (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of \n SELECT CHEMICALS     anhydrous ammonia        and      propane\n If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n \n2. Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nSELECT CHEMICALS     anhydrous ammonia        and      propane     is / are stored at the facility in ENTER NUMBER storage tanks (XX, 000 gallons (2), XX, 000 gallons (1), XX, 000 gallons (3), COMPLETE LIST ). \n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be ENTER NUMBER pounds. \n\nREPEAT PARAGRAPH FOR OTHER CHEMICALS\n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be ENTER NUMBER pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is ENTER NUMBER miles.  \n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is ENTER NUMBER miles.  \n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe"
