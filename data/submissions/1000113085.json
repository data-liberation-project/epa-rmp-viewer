Environmental, health, and safety planning is integrated into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks and working collaboratively with others addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\n2.\tStationary source and regulated substances handled\nThis plant makes formaldehyde solutions.  The site has two (2) formaldehyde manufacturing facilities.  The site distributes the formaldehyde solutions.\nFormaldehyde is the regulated substance on site and has a maximum storage quantity of 1,030,000 pounds.\n\n3.\tAccidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, The OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and applicable state code and regulations.  The site has a safety management system that includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control check sheet is used to manage tasks.\nPersonnel are assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operational procedures up-to-date, training on these procedures and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.  All employees participate in the safety program to improve safety and plant operation.\nDesignated personnel maintain the Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool for reference.\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safegu"

Recommendations resulting from the process hazard analyses are entered into an action items database to track items to completion.  PHA completion dates are based on Site Leader signature of final report.\nManagement of Change (MOC) system is used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures or processes or product formulation go through a safety review.  This review may include a process hazard analysis.\nPreventative maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  An electronic database is used to manage the preventative maintenance schedule and other corrective or improvement repairs necessary to maintain the ongoing integrity and reliability of the facility equipment.  Scheduled equipment inspections, tests or servicing are performed on a routine frequency.  The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases.  For applicable work activities, the site uses a hot work permit system.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  These procedures reduce the likelihood of errors made while performing activities.\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.  All Contractor work is performed using work permit system which contains a description of the work and risk assessment of the work to be completed on each permit.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent reoccurrence.
