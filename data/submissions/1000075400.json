Airgas policy is to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  This executive summary sets forth some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release and prevention program.  Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.  The following are examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Release Detection - Ammonia detectors located around covered process equipment to detect and alarm.  (2) Release Mitigation - Personal protective equipment; e.g., personal gas detectors, protective outerwear clothing, safety googles, shoes, etc.  (3) System Integrity - Automatic control and manual valves that provide isolation for ammonia process equipment, check valves on ammonia loading lines and pressure safety valves for the process piping and vessels.  (4) Facility and Environment - Contracted emergency response specialist, Airgas Ammonia Division, to support the Stockton plant emergency action plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation (EP):\r\n\r\nAirgas has developed a written plan of action and Stockton employee/operators are expected to participate in the accidental release prevention program (RMP/PSM).   Employees are trained on and provided access to the ammonia refrigeration process safety information.  Specific actions of employee involvement in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan.  Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation.  Employees participate in mo"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely.  Employees are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these safe operating limits.\r\n\r\nThe Facility Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is kept accurate and is readily accessible as part of the written employee participation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\r\n\r\nAirgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years or as required by Management Of Change (MOC).   The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process.  For future PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Airgas action item database tracking system.

Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nAirgas operating procedures have safe operating limits identified along with consequences of unsafe deviation.  Procedures further provide steps for operators to take that will correct or avoid an unsafe deviation.

These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate by the facility manager. \r\n\r\n\r\nTraining (TN):\r\n\r\nAirgas has implemented a training program for all employee/operators involved in the ammonia covered process.  All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topics as:  general orientation, facility rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response.  In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years.  Training is documented and tracked on a local training matrix and electronically in the Airgas University training system. \r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity (MI):\r\n\r\nAirgas has established mechanical integrity (MI) practices and procedures, based on preventative philosophy, to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems,"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Resolutions to recommendations are documented, tracked and closed.  Once the resolutions have been completed, changes are communicated to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the covered process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions.

The Stockton refrigeration process stores approximately 5,000 lbs of liquefied ammonia under pressure in the main receiver.  Between this vessel, all connected piping, compression, condensers and related processes involved in the facility, there is a total amount of 13,000 lbs anhydrous ammonia in the covered process.\r\n\r\nOn or about March 5th, 2019 this production facility and process will be commissioned and the single bulk storage vessel will charged with anhydrous ammonia.  The covered process will exceed the listed regulatory threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs for anhydrous ammonia and will be subject to chemical accident prevention provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical:\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, presented in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68) (the RMP Rule Level 3).  Anhydrous ammonia is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration process safety management program presented in Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119 (OSHA PSM), as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP Level 3) program found in California's Code of Regulations Title 19.  CalARP mirrors the federal RMP Rule; however it includes some additional state requirements and is implemented at the local government level by the Unified Program Agencies (UPAs) which determine the level of detail in the RMPs, review the RMPs, conduct facility inspections and provide public access to RMP information.  The San Joaquin County Environmental Health Department (UPA) is the implementing agency for the Airgas CO2 plant due to ammonia's toxicity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenera"
