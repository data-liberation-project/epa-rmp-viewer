This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Kansas City Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled. This facility builds Propane trucks and repairs Propane trucks. The storage consists of two 2,000 gallon Propane storage tanks and one 2,600 gallon Propane storage tanks. The three tanks are piped together. Propane is pumped from the storage tanks into the Propane trucks which are tested to assure there are no leaks and the truck's systems for handling Propane are working properly.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios. The worst-case scenario would be the failure of one of the Propane storage tanks which could result in a vapor cloud explosion that would involve not only the facility, but the surrounding area as well. An alternative release would be a fire which may only involve Propane leaking from piping. However, such a release and fire could also result in a vapor cloud explosion which could involve the surrounding area.\n\n \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard, and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law. The city Fire Marshall approved the setting of the propane storage tanks.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history. This facility has never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program. In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our poli"
