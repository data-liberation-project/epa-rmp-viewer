Model Predictive control is an advanced control method where a mathematical model of the process is used to predict future behavior. The predictions from the model are used in a mathematical optimization algorithm that calculates the optimal process inputs in order to achieve optimal future behavior of selected variables in the process. Constraints and setpoints may be imposed both on the manipulated process inputs variables and the controlled process output variables. The CENIT system will ensure that the process is safely controlled in spite of uncertain and changing process characteristics."

Another example would be that pre-startup review procedures have been modified to incorporate reevaluation of the facility accident scenarios to determine whether the worst case and alternate case scenarios for releases are still consistent with the design and operation of the process being started.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nArclin Toledo has had no accidental releases of formaldehyde in the last five years that have caused any deaths or injuries at the facility or any offsite consequences.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nArclin Toledo has established a facility emergency response plan that meets the requirements of both the OSHA PSM program and the EPA RMP program. This response plan describes the procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies of a release, provides documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental exposures, and procedures and measures for emergency response after a release. Local emergency response and medical treatment personnel have worked with Arclin to provide for the safe control and treatment of releases of formaldehyde. Arclin employees receive mandatory training on emergency response procedures and emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance. Emergency response procedures are reevaluated as part of the management of change and prestartup review requirements of the PSM and RMP programs.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nArclin Toledo is fully committed to implementing planned changes each year which improve the safety of the facility. Capital Improvements currently being considered (as of the date of publication) include:\r\n(1) Upgrades to the Formaldehyde storage tank valve automation and additional programming, interlocks, and alarms to prevent formaldehyde releases due to overfilling/overflowing of sto"

Formaldehyde is produced by processing methanol, which is delivered to the plant via rail car and tank truck. The specialty resins are produced using formaldehyde and various other raw materials. Finished products are shipped offsite in tanker trucks, drums and totes. The maximum quantity of formaldehyde in storage in one vessel is 50,000 gallons at a concentration of 53.5% by weight.\r\n\r\nAPPLICABILITY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\nThe threshold quantity for formaldehyde is 15,000 pounds. The three identified processes at Arclin Toledo which are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program are the Formaldehyde Manufacturing process and the Resin Manufacturing process, which includes two resin reactors (K1 & K2).\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY POLICY OF ARCLIN USA, LLC\r\nArclin is committed to a clean, safe and healthy environment through the implementation of a management system dedicated to the prevention of pollution and continual improvement of our environmental, health and safety performance. We are committed to complying with applicable governmental laws and regulations and to meet the requirements of other organizations to which we subscribe. Our employees are our most important asset, and an integral part of the success of our environmental, health and safety programs. We will properly train, equip, and direct employees to perform their jobs in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nAll covered processes at Arclin are in Program 3 and meet the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The existing OSHA PSM program meets nearly all RMP requirements. Where the programs differ, the Arclin's program elements have been expanded to incorporate RMP issues. An example would be"
