The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68 (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPetromax adheres to applicable Federal and State regulations and has established a commitment to worker and public safety.  Safety precautions are in place when handling NFPA-4 and other flammable mixtures to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce the threat to personal health, and ensure the safety of personnel, contractors, the community, and the environment.  Each Petromax employee that performs work in the process unit is required to have 40 hours of initial and 8-hour annual refresher training on Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).  \n\n\n\nThe facility Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) defines the steps the facility and each employee should take during an accidental release of a RMP-regulated substance.  The ICP includes both evacuation and protective action procedures for individuals onsite not directly involved in the response and the actions to be taken by employees responsible for responding to and mitigating the release.  All employees are trained in the applicable emergency response procedures.  The ICP also includes procedures for notifying facility personnel, emergency response personnel, applicable regulatory agencies, North Channel Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Channelview Fire Department.\n\n\n\n2.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Petromax facility is a 25,000 barrels per day (BPD) fractionation facility consisting of an atmospheric distillation unit designed to provide run products to storage facilities.  Crude oil/condensate feed is delivered to the facility b"

The feed is pumped to the crude charge heater and then sent to the fractionation column where the petroleum fractions separate into liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), un-stabilized naphtha, light distillate, middle distillate, heavy distillate, and atmospheric gas oil (AGO).  Toxic chemicals listed in 40 CFR 68.130 are handled at the facility below the respective RMP applicability thresholds.  Petromax handles flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 4 (NFPA-4).  \n\n\n\nThree product streams: light distillate, middle distillate and heavy distillate, are removed from side draws off the fractionation column at different levels.  Each material passes through heat exchangers after leaving the column, where it is cooled and are sent to storage tanks.  AGO leaves the column bottom and is pumped to storage.  Light distillate, middle distillate, heavy distillate, and AGO are mixtures that do not meet the NFPA-4 criteria, since they all have flash points above 73 degrees Fahrenheit (22.8 degrees Celsius) and boiling points above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).\n\n\n\nThe lighter hydrocarbons are vaporized and leave the fractionation column in the overhead product stream.  The overhead products are cooled and condensed, and a portion is sent back to the column as reflux.  The remaining material is further separated into a naphtha product stream and LPG.  These streams are treated to remove potential contaminants in the Vapor Point unit before being sent to storage.  Naphtha contains a regulated substance above one percent but the entire mixture does not meet the NFPA-4 criteria, since the boiling point is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  LPG is compressed and pumped to four pressurized bullet tanks after processing to remove entrained water."

LPG is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment, a.k.a., Offsite Consequence Analyses (OCA) for worst-case and alternative release scenarios were completed using the methods and tools developed or approved by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The worst-case scenario assumes that the vessel with the greatest amount of flammable mixture had a catastrophic failure resulting in instant release and vaporization of the entire content to the atmosphere followed by a vapor cloud explosion.  The entire weight of the mixture corresponding to the maximum liquid level was used to calculate the distance to the 1 pound per square inch (psi) overpressure endpoint.  The RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance Equation C-1 was used to predict a distance to the 1 psi endpoint.\n\n\n\nPetromax considered several Alternative Case Scenarios including a loading hose failure and a puncture of the LPG storage tank.  The scenarios are documented in the paperwork maintained onsite per the regulatory requirement.  Only one scenario is reported in Section 5 of the RMP submission per the RMP guidelines.  The endpoint distance of the reported scenario reached the property boundary of the Petromax facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.  Petromax employees are consulted and have access to information regarding all PSM elements.  Petromax maintains information on the process equipment, hazardous characteristics, and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes.  The PSM program was recently audited by Risktec Solutions, Inc.\n\n\n\nThe facility has recently completed a"

The methodologies used during the PHA study met the requirements of the OSHA regulation codified in Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) and of Clean Air Act, Section 112(r)(7)EPA codified in 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention, a.k.a.,Risk Management Program regulation.  The PHA covered all major process equipment and used the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique.  The PHA discussed previous incidents as an aid in identifying hazards of the process.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear written instructions for conducting activities safely.  SOPs address operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  SOPs are revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  The written operating procedures are readily available to operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nA mechanical integrity program is in place that will perform inspection and tests on equipment and correct any equipment deficiencies and apply quality assurance measures.  The facility has both predictive and preventative maintenance programs that include inspections, tests, and routine maintenance activities that are performed by trained and competent employees and contractors.  Inspection and testing frequencies are prescribed by manufacturers and industry standards.\n\n\n\nFacility and process changes are managed through a management-of-change (MOC) program.  The MOC program outlines approval responsibilities and requires hazard evaluations prior to the implementation of any changes affecting a covered process.  Affected personnel and contractors are trained in the changes before any change is implemented.  Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR) are conducted by appropriate employees, as spelled out in the facility's PSS"
