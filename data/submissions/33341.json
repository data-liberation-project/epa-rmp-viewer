Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nThe Burlington Municipal Waterworks handles chlorine that is considered to be a hazardous material by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Our policies adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.\n\nThe Burlington Municipal Waterworks operates a water treatment plant that serves a community with a population of 26,800 people.  For both incidental and non-incidental releases of chlorine, the Waterworks will rely on community emergency responders.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the Burlington Fire Department in the event of such a release.  The Burlington Fire Department has a trained hazardous material response team.  The plan also calls for notification of potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The Burlington Municipal Waterworks and regulated substances handled:\nThe primary purpose of the Burlington Municipal Waterworks water treatment facility is to clean and disinfect water to be used by the City of Burlington and rural neighbors for potable and firefighting purposes.  Chlorine is used in the treatment process as a disinfectant.  Chlorine is shipped by truck to the water treatment plant in 2,000-pound (one ton) cylinders.  The chlorine cylinders are offloaded into the chlorine storage room adjoining to the remainder of the water treatment plant building.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is chlorine.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored at this facility is 8,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\nThe Burlington Municipal Waterworks has worked to comply with EPA\u00bfs Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and with State codes and regulations.  This facility was designed and constructed between 1965 and 1967, and contains separate chlorine storage and feed rooms.  The ventilation system in the chlorine storage room maintains bot"

      "SummaryText": "h rooms under negative pressure preventing released chlorine from migrating directly to other internal portions of the water treatment plant.  Chlorine detectors are maintained in both the chlorine storage and feed rooms.  When activated the detectors sound an alarm in the main control room of the facility.  In the event of an alarm or some other emergency, the emergency action plan is initiated.  \n\n4.  The five-year accident history:\nThe Burlington Municipal Waterworks has not had an accidental release of chlorine from the covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response program has been developed to respond to upset or malfunction conditions.  The Burlington Fire Department will be called (dial 911) in the event outside emergency assistance is warranted.  This program has been discussed with the Des Moines County Emergency Management Agency Director and the Burlington Fire Department\u00bfs Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) team.  The HAZMAT team has conducted training at the facility specifically related to a chlorine emergency and will continue to do so in the future.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety.\nSafety and health is constantly changing.  The Burlington Municipal Waterworks is striving to make safety and health a dynamic, progressive endeavor.  This facility currently utilizes chlorine detectors in both the chlorine storage and feed rooms.  The detectors set off an audible alarm in the control room.  The facility is staffed 24 hours per day; therefore someone is always on duty to initiate emergency response procedures should the alarm sound.  Additionally, each vacuum regulator is equipped with automatic shutoffs that activate in the event of loss of vacuum, shutting off the flow of chlorine to the process beyond these regulators."
