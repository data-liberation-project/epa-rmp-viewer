Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n    \nThe management and employees of Bureau Service Company are committed to the pervention\nof any accidental releases of anhydrous ammoniia.  If an accidential release should occur, the\nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\nOne of the primary activities at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Acess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 280,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the total contents of a \nstorage tank or tank car relesed as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantitiy released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank or tank car as limited by design standards.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is 2.5 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.\n\nThe distance to the endpoint of .14 mg/L for the alternative scenario is .19 miles.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4.  The accidential release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidentai Release Prevention Rule and all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safey Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, publishe"
