If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. A Management of Change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\n\nAn integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance. WES incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nI. Safe Work Practices\nWES has safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, Industrial Standards and Good Engineering Practice in place to help provide employee, public and process safety.\n\nJ. Management of Change (MOC)\nWES has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all Reported Covered Processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\nChanges are reviewed to:\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\n3. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.

Facility personnel periodically monitor Contractor performance with regard to their safety obligations.\n\nG. Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nWES conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the Process Safety Information or procedure. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check that construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

The team is tasked to identify, evaluate and make recommendations In the  management of the potential hazards associated with the process. If possible, the team affects the changes necessary to mitigate the hazards identified. If the mitigation required is more involved or cannot be mitigated by the team, their findings are forwarded to WES Management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the PHA to assure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and that new hazards or previously unknown hazards can be dealt with. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nD. Operating Procedures\nWES maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by employees and management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate, revising them as necessary by em"
