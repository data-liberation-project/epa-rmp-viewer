The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management and employees of Farm Service Coop are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application.\n\n3.  Worse Case and Alternate Case Scenario. (Not included)\n\nRMP Comp was used to determine the worst case scenario release at this facility.  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences.  We have passive mitigation devices including excess flow valves, relief valves, check valves, and manual shut-off valves.  The alternative release scenario is based on the most likely incident to occur which is a break in a transfer hose.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nFarm Service Co-op at Onawa, IA complies with ANSI K-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydous ammonia in the past five years that:  resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program is in the event of an emergency involving our ammonia anhydrous system.  It is our policy to notify the Onawa Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  W"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
