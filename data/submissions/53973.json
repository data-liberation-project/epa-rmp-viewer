Facility accident release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Agripride FS, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facilty is prepared to work with Breese Fire Department, Clinton County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment.\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 50 Mine Street, is the storage and distibution of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of 1-30,000 storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 598,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirement for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. K6-11. published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910 111. Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of out employees make up accident release prevention program.\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n-have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; n"
