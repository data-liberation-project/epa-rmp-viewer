      "SummaryText": "The Northridge Gas Plant is a natural gas liquids (NGL) and gas dehydration facility (\"Facility\"), which utilizes more than the threshold quantity of a \"regulated flammable substance\" (10,000 pounds) in the processing of natural gas.  The NGL is an RMP-regulated flammable mixture.  Therefore, this Facility is subject to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68 (40 CFR 68) administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\n\n\nThe Northridge Gas Plant is also subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and public receptors are located within the worst-case release scenario for the plant.  Therefore, the Northridge Gas Plant is subject to Program 3 requirements as stated in 40 CFR 68.10. OSHA's PSM standard closely parallels requirements outlined in USEPA's RMP Rule.  All elements required by USEPA's 40 CFR 68 - Program 3 Prevention Program are also required by OSHA's PSM. \n\n\n\nWithin the last five (5) years, the Northridge Gas Plant has not had an accidental release of a regulated substance where exposure to the substance, its reaction products, overpressure generated by an explosion involving the substance, or radiant heat generated by a fire involving the substance led to any off-site death, injury, or response or restoration activities for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  \n\n\n\nThe Northridge Gas Plant employs 13 full-time employees on-site who ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the Facility.  \n\n\n\nEnLink Midstream Operating, L.P. (EnLink), formerly Devon Energy Corporation, last submitted a full RMP the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in December 2011 for the Northridge Gas Plant.  The current RMP includes administrative updates addressing the change from Devon Energy Corporation to EnLink and is being submitted as a full 5-year update.      \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE"

      "SummaryText": " PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Northridge Gas Plant maintains a policy of safe NGL treatment operations, reducing to the greatest extent possible hazards associated with the treatment processes, and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, employees, and the environment.    \n\n\n\nThe Northridge Gas Plant has procedures in place, including both on-site activities and coordination with off-site responders that are to be followed in the event of a NGL release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Northridge Gas Plant treats NGL in various aboveground vessels and associated piping and valves.  NGL is a flammable hydrocarbon mixture that may contain the following RMP-regulated flammables: propane, ethane, N-butane, isobutane, isopentane, N-pentane, and methane.  \n\n\n\nThe Facility also stores and processes the following RMP-regulated substances: methane and natural gas condensate.  Natural gas condensate is a flammable hydrocarbon mixture that contains isobutane, N-butane, neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane), isopentane, and N-pentane.  Methane is stored at the Facility in its pure form.  \n\n\n\nAlthough natural gas condensate is often classified as an NFPA Class 3 flammable substance, testing completed by EnLink demonstrates that the mixture would, at times, be considered an NFPA Class 4 flammable based upon the flash point and boiling point of the mixture. As such, EnLink has chosen to include natural gas condensate in the RMP-regulated inventory.\n\n\n\nThe following provides the maximum storage capacity and largest vessel capacity, calculated using100 percent vessel capacity, for all of the RMP-regulated flammables stored at the Northridge Gas Plant.\n\n\n\nRMP STORAGE INVENTORY\n\n\n\nSubstance\n\nMethane: Maximum inventory 3,700 pounds; Largest vessel 3,700 pounds\n\nNatural Gas Liquids: Maximum inventory 1,104,826 pounds; Largest vessel 313,162 pounds \n\nNatural Gas Condensate: Maximum inventory 105,049 pounds; Largest vessel "

      "SummaryText": "105,049 pounds \n\n\n\nThe substances stored at the Northridge Gas Plant were also evaluated for toxic characteristics; it was determined that there are no RMP-regulated toxic substances handled at the Facility in quantities that exceed RMP threshold quantities.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Northridge Gas Plant maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of NGL.  As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is identical to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM.  The Northridge Gas Plant's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM Plan, which is kept on-site as a separate document.  Required elements include:    \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation; \n\nProcess Safety Information; \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis;\n\nOperating Procedures;\n\nTraining;\n\nContractors; \n\nPre-startup Review; \n\nMechanical Integrity; \n\nHot Work Permits;\n\nManagement of Change; \n\nIncident Investigation; and \n\nCompliance Audits.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Northridge Gas Plant has had no accidental releases of flammable materials regulated under the RMP program that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or any environmental impact for the period of five (5) years prior to May 2015.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM Rule.  The Emergency Response Program required under the RMP and PSM Rules must be site-specific and comprehensive, including the following elements: \n\n\n\nPublic and emergency response agency notification procedures; \n\nProper first aid and emergency medical treatment; \n\nEmergency response measures; \n\nProcedures for inspecting, testing, and maintain"
