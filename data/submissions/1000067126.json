      "SummaryText": "The Eggo Company manufactures a variety of waffles at our facility in Rossville.  We have produced waffles in Rossville since 1988.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is used at our facility as the cooling medium in our refrigeration system.  Similar to the function Freon plays in a home or car air conditioning system, ammonia is used to cool the air in our industrial freezers and product coolers.  The ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nEggo takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.   We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Plant Director is responsible for the management of these ammonia safety programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nEggo's Rossville plant produces waffles for sale to the public.  Ammonia is the only substance covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Rossville plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Employee Participation Program \n\n- Process"

Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo ammonia-related accidents occurred at the Rossville plant over the past five years that resulted in significant of-site or offsite consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nE.   Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the Rossville Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  \n\n\n\n\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility is currently removing some of the ammonia refrigeration equipment used to produce waffles.  These changes will reduce the maximum intended ammonia inventory and thus improve safety at the facility."
