Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Rhone Poulenc Surfactants & Specialties, LP -- operating as Rhodia Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances; and ensure the safety of employees and neighbors.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur Winder, Georgia facility's primary activity is the manufacture of surfactants and specialty chemicals.  These products are used in the manufacture a variety of consumer goods, including personal care products such as soaps, shampoos, detergents, and textile processing aids.  We also make polyester based polymers which are used for soil release in detergent applications and in textile processing..  We presently have 3 substances at our facility, which are regulated under the EPA RMP regulations.  These are Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-], Methylamine  [Methanamine] and Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-].  Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for production of Episulfonate Solution - an intermediate used to produce surfactants for Industrial and Personal Care Products.  Methylamine  [Methanamine] is used for Methyl Taurine - a surfactant for commercial cleaning applications.  Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] is used for production of ASC Intermediate, which is used to produce an end product used in various Industrial and Personal Care Products.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] at our facility is 285,000 lb.

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed Phast ver 5.2 modeling program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Episulfonate Solution process.  In this scenario 98000 lb. of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is released from a railcar.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 5665 minutes. Passive mitigation systems such as a berm are also taken into account to calculate the scenario. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.4 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] involves a release from a gasket leak in the Epichlorohydrin transfer line from the storage tank to the Episulfonate Solution manufacturing vessel.  The scenario involves the release of 5480 lb. of Epichlorohydrin liquid, that is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The leak is estimated to last for 20 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled or limited by an excess flow valve and our emergency safety shutdown system.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is 0.07 miles.\n\nThe worst case release s"

In this scenario 33000 lb. of Methylamine  [Methanamine] in a flammable 40% aqueous solution is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released, vaporized, and then finds an ignition source causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.23 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a hose break while unloading 40% Dimethylamine from a tank truck.  The release is assumed to result in a Jet flame.  The scenario involves the release of 1220 lb. Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-] in a flammable 40% aqueous solution released in two minutes.  Passive mitigation controls taken into account to calculate the scenario for this system is that the unloading is a fully attended operation - We estimate that the operator will stop unloading within two minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the high heat radiation (5 kw/m2) endpoint is 0.04 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a hose break while unloading 40% Methylamine from a tank truck.  The release is assumed to result in a Jet flame.  The scenario involves the release of 886 lb. Methylamine  [Methanamine] in a flammable 40% aqueous solution released in two minutes.
