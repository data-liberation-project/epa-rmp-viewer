      "SummaryText": "CF Industries Holdings, Inc. is headquartered in Deerfield, IL, a suburb of Chicago. Through its CF Industries, Inc. subsidiary, it operates nine nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom and a network of fertilizer distribution terminals and warehouses, located primarily in major grain-producing states in the U.S. Midwest. It also owns  50% of a joint venture in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. CF Industries, Inc. employs nearly 3000 people. CF Industries adheres to stringent safety and environmental stewardship standards at all of its operations.\r\n\r\nWhat are fertilizers?\r\n\r\nFertilizers are plant nutrients. Nutrients exist naturally in the earth's soil and atmosphere, and in animal manure. However, naturally occurring nutrients are not always available in the forms that plants can use. Therefore, man-made fertilizer is vital to food production. Man-made and natural fertilizers contain the same ingredients, but man-made fertilizers act more quickly and are less susceptible to weather changes. Farmers, ranchers, and gardeners add these fertilizers directly to the soil, where they can be absorbed by plants for healthy growth. Incorporated into a program of best management practices, which includes soil testing, man-made fertilizer use leads to higher crop yields and greater environment protection. Man-made fertilizers have made a tremendous difference in farm productivity and the well being of the world's people.\r\n\r\nCF Industries Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex\r\n\r\nCF Industries' nitrogen complex at Donaldsonville, LA is North America's largest and, in many respects, its most flexible nitrogen operation. It can produce and ship approximately 5 million tons of nitrogen for agricultural and industrial uses each year. Donaldsonville's location provides numerous advantages, including access to low-cost river and other transportation modes, abundant supplies of natural gas (the primary raw material used to produce am"

With four docks on the Mississippi River and extensive product handling and storage capabilities, it has a unique make versus buy capability. As a result, CF Industries can respond quickly to market conditions by supplementing or replacing a portion of its manufacturing capacity with purchased product.\r\n\r\nDescription of Manufacturing Units and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManufacturing activity at Donaldsonville begins with the production of ammonia. Ammonia is in turn utilized in the production of urea, nitric acid, and UAN solution. The complex has five ammonia plants, one urea solution plant, four granular urea plants, three nitric acid plants, and two UAN blending units. The primary RMP regulated substance at the facility is ammonia that is manufactured, shipped as a product (via railcars, tanker trucks, barges, ships, and pipeline), and used as feedstock for other products.  Aqueous ammonia (greater than 20 wt%) is produced from ammonia at the site and is shipped out in tanker trucks and railcars. Chlorine is also present in excess of threshold quantities. Chlorine is used as a biocide in water treatment. The flammable substances hydrogen,  methane, and ethane also qualify for regulation under the rule. A flammable mixture (hydrogen and methane), referred to as syngas, is produced from natural gas and water in the ammonia process and trace quantities present in by-product carbon dioxide are a concern in the urea process. Natural gas (a flammable mixture containing methane and ethane) is used as feedstock for the ammonia process and as a fuel throughout the facility.  \r\n\r\nEnvironment, Health and Safety Philosophy\r\n\r\nIt is the philosophy of CF Industries to conduct its business and operate its facilities in a safe and secure manner designed to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees.

      "SummaryText": "Industries is committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations and will promote environmental concern and education among its employees and with the communities in which it operates. CF Industries is equally committed to protecting the safety and health of its employees and will take all practical steps to eliminate or reduce the exposure of employees to conditions adversely affecting their safety or health while on the job. It encourages off-the-job employee safety and health awareness as well. Additionally, all facilities, where CF Industries has operating control, will have appropriate security measures in place to protect employees, surrounding communities, facilities, property, and products from persons intending to do harm or cause damage. The corporation will not hesitate to go beyond legal requirements if, in its prudent judgment, a higher level of performance is in order. Management at each facility is directly responsible for the development and implementation of programs and procedures to ensure conformance with this philosophy. These programs and procedures will be reviewed and updated continually, and each facility is audited periodically by our Corporate EHS Group to assure compliance.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex is subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards 29 CFR 1910.119. According to EPA, PSM standards form the basis for the Agency's RMP prevention program component. In addition to the required prevention program elements, each area where the regulated substances mentioned above are handled, has specific safety features such as remote Isolation valves, control systems and alarms. These chemical specific prevention steps are all managed under our PSM program.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility's emergency response plan meets the OSHA"

Facility personnel participate in Community Awareness Emergency Response Committee meetings where representatives of chemical companies and the Ascension Parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness formulate, implement, and maintain up-to-date community emergency response plans.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nTwo accidents have occurred in the past 5 years that meets the RMP rule reporting requirements.  One involving a release of chlorine that resulted in an onsite injury but had no offsite or environmental impacts. The other involved a release of ammonia that resulted in an onsite injury but had no offsite or environmental impacts.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility has a goal of continuous improvement and uses total quality management techniques to define and address issues. Continued pursuit of the improvement goal is planned to improve safety."
