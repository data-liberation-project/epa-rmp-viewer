      "SummaryText": "Mississippi Power Company's (MPC) Daniel Electric Generating Plant, located near Escatawpa, Mississippi, is a four (4) unit steam electric generating plant.  The gas fired combustion turbine (CT) construction in 2001 added approximately 1000 megawatts (MW) of electric power.  There are two (2) identical nominal 500 mw \"blocks\"  of electric generating equipment.  The arrangements for each \"block\" are referred to as a two-on-one configuration.  Each \"block\" is comprised of two CTs, each with a supplementary fired (duct burner) heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) that supply steam to a single steam turbine.  Each \"block\" includes two (2) Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Systems for post combustion NOx control which utilize ammonia.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the facility to provide and maintain safe and healthy working conditions for all employees.   Plant Daniel implements and adheres to operating practices that safeguards employees and results in safe working conditions and an efficient and environmentally safe operation.  The facility has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  The program includes training and instructions.\n\n\n\nThe process at the natural gas fired CTs subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is part of the SCR system used to control emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning natural gas.  Ammonia will also be used in the treatment of the boiler water used in the facility.  \n\n\n\nBased on the EPA criteria, the worst-case release scenario at the facility is the catastrophic failure of the 18,000 gallon ammonia storage  tanks.  These tanks will be maintained at 85% capacity through administrative procedures.  This would result in the ammonia gas traveling a distance of 1.50 miles before it reached the endpoint.  However, this type failure is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the prevention program.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenari"

A failure of this type would result in ammonia gas traveling 0.06 miles before reaching its endpoint.  There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the plant designed to prevent this from occurring.  However, for emergency response planning purposes, they were not considered in the alternative release scenario. \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at the Daniel Combined Cycle Facility is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage and dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program at the plant was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsiblity and responsiblity of the individual program elements.  Additional steps include:  ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution system is accurate, complete, and up to date; ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining, and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance Procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified and oriented to the site hazards; and conducting periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\n\n\n\nPlant Daniel has not had any spills in the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe Daniel Combined Cycle Facility Emergency Plans are coordinated with Jackson County LEPC.  In addition, the plant has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The procedures cover the following:  evacuation plan; recognizing emergencies; emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response con"
