This eliminates confusion as the Corporate Office, Program Drivers and three other facilities are located in California.\n\n\n\nThese processes do not meet the requirements of Program 1. They are subject to OSHA's PSM standard.  Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance. To reduce confusion and to keep procedures and programs consistent all processes have been identified as Program Level 3 and developed as such.\n\n\n\nThis program was updated starting in March of 2015 to meet the required 5 year update and to make corrections as necessary. All elements have been updated.\n\n\n\nThe following areas are addressed in this summary:\n\n\n\n1.    Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\n\n2.

All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to seasonal startup. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment.\n\n\n\nThere are additional full time supervisors and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Manager that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. This team activity is the core of Tanimura and Antle's prevention program.  \n\n\n\nA-2    STATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nThe Tanimura and Antle facility provides product cooling, and short-term storage for fresh vegetables and sometimes fruit. Stationary systems (engine rooms) are operated 24 hours per day approximately from April-December; Portable Equipment is operated from March-April (dependant upon growing season) through October from 8:00 am - 10:00 pm.\n\n\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Yuma County on a contiguous property. There are two fixed systems attached to the cold storage and processing buildings that are completely separate and in different locations but are in one interconnected building. The portable refrigeration equipment is trailer or skid mounted and is used for pre-cool"

The original facility was built in 1988 and expanded and modified in 1994 and 1996. \n\n\n\nA-3     HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures. The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\n\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the Main Plant Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\n\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nA-4    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nTanimura and Antle's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by Tanimura and Antle is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of Tanimura and Antle's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. \n\n\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system.  The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e"

All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by Tanimura and Antle.  \n\n\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases.  \n\n\n\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.  Tanimura and Antle certifies operators following completion of operator training and Tanimura and Antle's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned.  \n\n\n\n5) Employee involvement in the Prevention Program.  This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \n\n\n\nSecond, all Tanimura and Antle employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Tanimura and Antle's Management of Change Procedure. \n\n \n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Tanimura and Antle has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Tanimura and Antle Hot Work permit is required.  The purp"

This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by Tanimura and Antle personnel.
