This is addressed on two levels.  First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \r\n\r\nSecond, all Tanimura and Antle employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training.  Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information.  These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\r\n\r\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical).  These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by Tanimura and Antle's Management of Change Procedure. \r\n \r\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, Tanimura and Antle has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs close to the refrigeration system, a Tanimura and Antle Hot Work permit is required.  The purp"
