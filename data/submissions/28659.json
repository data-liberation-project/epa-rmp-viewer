Mojave, CA facility complies with applicable California and US EPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.  PRC-DeSoto also follows the Responsible Care (registered service mark) Code of Management Practices, including the Responsible Care (registered service mark) Community Awareness Emergency Response (CAER).  PRC-DeSoto International is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPG Industries, Inc. and follows PPG's own Community Awarenes and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is \"to market, distribute, and manufacture products globally in a responsible manner that protect employees, neighbors, customers, and the environment.\"  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\nPRC-DeSoto International Inc.'s Mojave, CA facility produces resins, adhesives and sealants used in the aerospace industry.  The facility stores and uses mixed isomers of Toluene 2, 4 Diisocyanate &Toluene 2, 6 Diisocyanate, both of which are referred to as TDI.  The faciity also stores and uses Allyl Alcohol, Formaldehyde (as 37% Formalin) and Propylene Oxide.  All of these compounds are listed in the US EPA's Risk Management Program.  With the exception of 2,4 & 2,6 TDI, none of the other above listed compounds are stored in quantities that exceed the Federal Threshold Planning Quantities.

EPA's ALOHA gaussian plume dispersion model was used to predict releases of the regulated compounds using the largest container size that each regulated compound is stored.  \n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release of the entire contents of the largest container.  Based on EPA RMP criteria, the worst case release scenario does not have offsite impact.\n\nBecause the worst case scenario has no off-site impact, no alternative case is required by the RMP regulation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of any of the Federal RMP or California CalARP compounds that are stored or used above the respective Threshold Planning Quantities in the past five years, which resulted in on-site, or off-site impacts as defined by EPA's RMP criteria.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP regulation specifies that covered processes at all plants must be classified as Program Level 1, 2 or 3 processes.  PRC-DeSoto International Inc.'s Mojave, CA processes are all classified as Program Level 1 processes because the Worst-Case Scenario has no off-site impact and because the processes covered have no accidental releases in the past five years that meet the RMP criteria.
