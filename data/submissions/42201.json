      "SummaryText": "SemStream L.P. acquired the Lebanon Terminal from Texon L.P. on February 1, 2005.  SemStream hired Texon's Terminal Manager and Terminal Operator to operate the facility.  Prior to the sale, operating procedures were reviewed and revised and a compliance audit and PHA were completed. SemStream has no immediate plans to implement any new policies or operating procedures which would effect the RMP.  In December,  2004, Texon hired Cocciardi and Associates, Inc. to re-submit their RMP as required by 40 CFR 68.190.  SemStream has reviewed and revised the information submitted by Cocciardi's, and is resubmitting the RMP merely to reflect the change of ownership and contact information.\n\nA)  SemStream L.P. is committed to the safety of its workers, the public and the environment.  Its accidental release policy is an integrated approach, involving employee participation, management practices, written procedures and training.  SemStream maintains a comprehensive accident prevention program considering all aspects of process operation and maintenance.  It also has an emergency action plan and coordinates these activities with local emergency responders (Lebanon Fire Department).\n\nB)  SemStream's Terminal in Lebanon Indiana receives liquid propane primarily by product pipeline, however product may also be received via railcar or truck transports.  SemStream's customers distribute the propane via truck transports.  There are seventeen (17) 90,000-gallon tanks at the site, capable of holding approximately 310,000 lbs. each of liquid propane.  The terminal's rail siding can provide temporary storage of seven (7) 30,000-gallon railcars, capable of holding approximately 130,000 lbs of propane each.\n\nC)  The offsite consequence analysis considers the worst case scenario and an alternative scenario involving a propane release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The RMP Rule specifies the explosion endpoint is 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe worst case scenario involves the failure of on"

      "SummaryText": "e of the 90,000-gallon tanks, holding approximately 310,00 lbs of propane.  It assumes all of the propane is released and ignited.  No passive mitigation is considered.  The explosion endpoint was identified as 0.5 miles (per RMP Comp Ver. 1.07).  A search of public receptors within the radius identified residential and commercial properties.  It is estimated that approximately 19 residents would be impacted by this event.\n\nThe alternative case scenario involves a propane release from a Multi-port 2.5 inch relief valve over a 5-minute period at a rate of 863 lbs per minute.  An excess flow check valve is the active mitigation considered in this scenario.  A total of 4,315 lbs of propane is ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  This would generate a pressure wave with a minimum of 1 psi overpressure extending 0.1 miles.  A search of public receptors within this radius identified residential and commercial properties.\n\nD) The Lebanon Terminal complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68, Subpart D), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119), the OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.120), and all applicable State and local codes and regulations.  The propane trasfer system was designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's (SemStream's) instructions.\n\nE)  To date, this facility has never had an incident involving propane which resulted in deaths, injuries, property/ environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in-place."
