Facility Information: The facility is a country grain elevator which stores and blends fertilizers and sells propane on a retail basis. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients. It is stored at the facility in one 18,000 gallon and 0ne 26,000 gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity stored would be 187,000 pounds. Propane is stored at a separate site in one 18,000 gallon tank and is used for grain drying. The maximum quantity stored would be 56,600 pounds.\n\n3. The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.
