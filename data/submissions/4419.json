To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson FoodsBerryville,Ar., this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Berryville, Ar., has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     Tyson Foods of Berryville has a staff of 1,675 team members working in a primary facility of 333,000 \n     square feet. The facility produces between 4.6 - 5.3 million pounds of product per week.\n     \n     Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility in two separate engine rooms with a total\n    quantity of 140,000lbs..  \n  \n3.

The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.

The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had one releases in the past 5 years of this type.\n \n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations         Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n    Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators.  \n5.  Five-year accident history.\n     On 3/28/1995, we had a breach in a Frigo freezer coil that caused air to enter the system causing a\n     subsequent relief valve function. During this time, approximately 3,000 pounds of ammonia was\n     released into the relief system going to the relief catch tank. Due to the release of ammonia from the\n     catch tank vent, several team members were sent to the hospital to have their medical condition\n     checked (primarily asthma) and then sent home. There were no off-site complaints or damages, but\n     air monitoring was conducted as a preventative measure. \n\n6.   The emergency response program.    \nA fully trained and equiped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).
