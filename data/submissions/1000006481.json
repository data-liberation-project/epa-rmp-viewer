There have been no chlorine or sulfur dioxide incidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program that was initiated in 1995 has been maintained current for the past ten years. The PSM compliance also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP) Prevention Program Site specific RMP/PSM Implementation Manual issued to the Water and Wastewater Plants are used to manage our compliance program. Key activities have included: \n\no\tAn annual review of  all chlorine, PSM and RMP procedures\no\tThree Year Refreshed training conducted in June 2009\no\tProcess Hazards Analysis were conducted in December 2006 \no\tSelf Audits every three years with the last one on November  2008\no\tA comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program that uses a computer-based maintenance scheduling program\no\tAn annual review and update of the Emergency Response Plan including periodic drills.\n  \t       \nThe supervisor, chief operators and several plant operators will meet several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with the requirements of the RMP/PSM regulation.\n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide delivery systems at the plants were upgraded to vacuum processes. This process greatly reduces the risks associated with pressurized chlorine lines.\n\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tAutomatic cylinder valve controls were installed on chlorine and sulfur dioxide cylinders to isolate the cylinders in the event of a detectable gas leak.\n\n\u00c2\u00bfX\tAt the Ed Thomas plant, gaseous chlorine was replaced by liquid bleach (sodium hypochlorite"

These scrubbers would capture and neutralized any released chlorine gas rendering it harmless. \nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Burlington Utility Department has had an active Safety Committee for fifteen years. The committee meets monthly with representatives from each function and each site.  The committee\u00c2\u00a1\u00c2\u00a6s duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. \n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\t- Hazard Communications\n\n\t- Personal Protective Equipment\n\n\t- Lockout/Tagout\n\n\t- Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the Utility Department has had a strong safety record with no hazardous material related loss-time accidents over the past three years. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\n\nReport by:\t\n                                                               \nEric Davis, Water & Sewer Operations Manager\nCity of Burlington"
