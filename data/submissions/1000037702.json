In the interest of public safety and in compliance with The EPA rules governing this plan it is submitted and reviewed on an ongoing basis every 5 years. \n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) is submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to meet the requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, codified in the Code of Federal Regulation Title 40 Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe Sitka Sound Seafoods processing facility is located in Sitka, Alaska, along the main channel immediately on the waterfront in the industrial area of town.  The Sitka Sound Seafood plant produces bulk and finished fresh and frozen seafood products, and operates on a year round basis. Fish deliveries are accepted from fishing vessels and plant ice is distributed to vessels so that they may keep their catch chilled until time of delivery. A majority of the product received at the facility is then processed and frozen, although much of it is now shipped fresh via air cargo using insulated boxes and gelpack ice. \n\n\n\nChilling, ice making, and freezing of finish product are accomplished via a refrigeration plant located within the facility. As a refrigerant for the freezing process of dressed and finished product, Anhydrous Ammonia is used in blast cells, plate freezers, chill rooms and frozen product holding rooms. \n\n\n\nThe plant consists of a compressor room, a system of piping, and evaporators located in insulated rooms to freeze and chill the product. The Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigerant is used as it is a very energy efficient and carries high heat content per unit of energy used. It is circulated throughout the plant within a piping system and returned to the compressor room. Anhydrous Ammonia is naturally occurring in the environment, and does not have the harmful effects as Freon does on th"

Under normal circumstances there is no danger to workers or the public. Engineering and safety measures are in place to mitigate any potential release of the chemical substance. There are no long term consequences to Ammonia exposure such as cancer and most of the effects of contact with ammonia are of the acute nature such as irritation. If there were a large release due to an accident, fire etc. There are plans in place to control the substance being released, to alert authorities, and respond to the event. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nWhile the City of Sitka does not have any specific Emergency Response Team trained, the company has a team of trained responders ready to mitigate leaks and large spills should that ever become necessary. The response team under goes annual Emergency Response Training refresher courses taught by certified instructors, all Responders have had their initial 24 hour training and have received certification. In addition to annual training a drill is conducted at least once per year, and donning of equipment is practiced. All equipment is inspected on a monthly basis, serviced at the required intervals, and is documented.  The local fire department will provide support during any emergency should it ever occur, this would include, site security, supply of compressed air for SCBAA?s, decontamination, evacuation of the surrounding area if necessary, medical assistance. \n\n\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nThe management of Sitka Sound Seafoods is fully committed to safety to employeeA?s and the surrounding community which we are a part of. Our maintenance procedures are structured to help prevent any accidental releases of ammonia. A system of evaluation of plant equipment identifies areas of concern and is addressed on an ongoing basis. We utilize the advice of contractors, engineering services, compliance consultants to evaluate ou"

The PSM program in place addresses all required elements, including employee awareness of hazards and participation in identification of potential hazards, process safety information including manuals for equipment, system drawings, operating procedures, are on hand. A system of permits such as hot work permits if the system is welded on, there is documentation of any major changes to the system utilizing the MOC - management of change form, and there is a pre-startup review prior to any new equipment startup. System mechanical integrity is determined on a regular basis by testing and inspecting. Employees receive training prior to operating or doing maintenance on the system. Every 3 years a required compliance audit is performed by a team to determine that the PSM plan is being adhered to, and every 5 years, (or if there is a major change the system) a PHA - process hazard analysis is conducted.  Periodically contractors are reviewed for their safety programs and record, there is written incident investigation procedure and emergency response plan in place.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system has a number of safety related items, including computer control and monitoring system that alerts operators to conditions outside the range of normal, first via on screen notification or warning, then by auditable alarms notifying operators that there is a problem with the system.
