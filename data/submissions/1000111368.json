      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Lambda Energy Resources Kalkaska Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes. Lambda Energy Resources's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe KGP is a modern cryogenic natural gas treating and processing plant. Hydrocarbons arrive at the KGP via three sources: 1) the Lambda Gathering wet header gathering pipelines, 2) truck offloading, and 3) railcar offloading. The gas and liquids from the Lambda Gathering wet headers are combined in a slug catcher at the Kalkaska Inlet Facility (KIF) where the gas and liquids separate and where measurement and custody transfer occur.\n\nThe gas exits the top of the KIF to the KGP Amine process for CO2 removal and CO2 Injection. The gas is then dried in the Mol Sieve Dehydration process and then sent to the Cryogenic Unit (Cryo) where the methane (Sales Gas) is separated from the rest of the hydrocarbon components in the Demethanizer. The liquids off of the bottom of the Demethanizer are then separated in the Deethanizer and Depropanizer. The Depropanizer is utilized in a batch process to operate as a Depropanizer, Debutanizer, and lastly as a Butane Splitter. The intermediate products from C3+ to the Splitter Feed are stored until needed as well as the finished products of ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, and condensate (C5+ liquids sold as oil). The KIF and methane storage consists of large diameter piping that is sloped and underground whereas all other product storage is aboveground in pressure-rated bullet tanks. Tr"

      "SummaryText": "ucks and Railcar hydrocarbon liquids are also offloaded and stored prior to processing into the Deethanizer. The ethane and condensate products are shipped out via pipeline. The propane and butane products are shipped out via LPG truck, rail, or in the past by pipeline, which the pipeline hasn't been used for other than ethane since 4/1/2014. The methane based Sales Gas is shipped out via pipeline to DTE/MichCon for distribution to their customers.\n\nThose liquids that entered the KIF are sent directly to the condensate stabilizer, where light ends are flashed off and routed upstream of the Amine Plant. The liquids from the Condensate Stabilizer go either to storage as condensate and then shipped out via pipeline or are stored in the Debutanizer Feed Tank for further processing. The stabilized condensate is shipped out via the Lambda Energy Gathering crude line. These processes contain multiple flammable mixtures that consist of several RMP regulated substances above the RMP threshold quantity (TQ), including propane, ethane, butane, isopentane, and isobutane.. There are no RMP regulated toxics above the RMP TQ.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Kalkaska Gas Plant. Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Kalkaska Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.

Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in developing and conducting all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs. Accident prevention is  discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary. Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The process safety information will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-sta1tup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information."

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest . risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed."

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency  until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the  team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities. To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees. Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.
