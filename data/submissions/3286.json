Because the wastewater treatment plant is regulated by the Process Safety Management (PSM), the regulatory program for these processes is Program 3.\n\nDuke Engineering & Services, Inc. (DE&S), on behalf of the City of Walla Walla, has developed a city-wide Risk Management Program (RMP) in compliance with EPA's RMP requirements. \n\nTREATMENT PROCESS MODIFICATION\nBoth chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems are scheduled for removal by December 1999.  The replacement systems for the current regulated processes are the on-site generation system for chlorination and the sodium disulfide system for dechlorination.  The new systems will not use the regulated chemicals listed in the Risk Management Program.\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nDE&S has performed a thorough review of the existing program documentation against the requirements of 40 CFR 68 and WAC 296-67.  The review determined some of the existing WWTP documentation and programs have, at least in part, satisfied the EPA RMP regulation.  However, some additions and modifications were necessary.  An implementation plan showing detailed tasks/subtasks and a recommended sequence of execution were provided in the Gaps Analysis Report, which is available at the WWTP.  To achieve compliance with the requirements of the Risk Management Program, the implementation plan can be summarized according to the following steps:\n\n7 DE&S has developed program documents, beginning with the management system procedures which provide the guidance, methodology and the format for developing other program documents.\n\n7 The hazard assessment and prevention program elements were developed along parallel paths.  These steps involved the majority of the time and resources required for completing the i"

Full implementation carrying the program into everyday use is one of the most challenging aspects of compliance with the rule.  This is the most critical for ensuring that compliance is maintained and the City of Walla Walla Wastewater Treatment Plant is operated as safely as possible.\n\n\nWWTP RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe following element summaries are brief statements of the current WWTP Risk Management Program.  \n\n1.1   Management\nA formal management system for RMP is currently in place and documented via a formal management procedure that defines program element responsibilities and documentation requirements.  The management procedure provides a good program overview.  The control document is placed at a central location for WWTP's requirements relating to the RMP.\n\n1.2   Hazard Assessment\nThe hazard assessment has been performed including the worst case analyses, alternative case analyses, and a five-year accident history for the Wastewater Treatment plant. The modeling suggests the downwind distance to the EPA RMP worst case endpoint health criteria will reach 1.3 miles.  The alternative release for chlorine and sulfur dioxide resulted in an endpoint distance of 0.1 miles.  No release was found in the WWTP's five-year accident history.  \n\nThe worse case scenario is extremely unlikely and EPA does not expect it to be selected as the basis for emergency planning under the RMP rules.  EPA suggests that emergency planning should focus on the alternative release, which is mo"

The hazard assessment information is available to the public.  The City of Walla Walla is prepared to explain to concerned citizens both the meaning of these results and what the city is doing to prevent such incidents through the Process Safety/Risk Management program.\n\nAs recommended by EPA, the City of Walla Walla used the results from the alternative endpoint criteria for emergency planning and response.  Should the worse case scenario occur, the City is prepared for rapid action in the effected areas.\n\n1.3   Prevention Program 3\n\n1.3.1  Process Safety Information\nThe City of Walla Walla WWTP has kept up-to-date process safety information to successfully implement the PSM/RMP elements, including Process Hazards Analysis (PHA), training, emergency planning and response, management of change, incident investigation, and compliance audits.  A management procedure has been developed to ensure current written process safety information is developed and maintained in a format that provides easy access by employees, PHA teams, and auditors.\n\n1.3.2  Process Hazards Analysis\nThe WWTP/DE&S team has conducted a Process Hazard Analyses  to identify, evaluate, and control the risk associated with the process hazards release scenarios at WWTP subject to the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Administration (WISHA) PSM and/or EPA RMP regulations. The overall purpose of the PHA is to comply with these regulations and to prevent or minimize the effects of a chemical release.\n\n1.3.3  Standard Operating Procedures\nThe City of Walla Walla WWTP has updated its Operating Procedures (OPs) and continues to maintain up-to-date, accurate, written OPs that provide clear instructions for all covered processes.  Effective OPs, when combined with operator training, are instrumental in ensuring safe operation of the systems and preventing accidental releases.\n\n1."

The \"on-the-job\" initial training for new operators has been performed.  The operating procedures will continue to be documented.\n\n1.3.5  Mechanical Integrity\nPlant maintenance activities are tracked via a logbook.  The maintenance request form is completed by the plant operator and signed off by the maintenance technician when the work is completed.  The Tests/Inspections/ Maintenance (TIMs) schedule for the critical components of chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems has been developed to ensure the continued integrity of the regulated process equipment.  \n\nThe TIM's information, currently maintained in the plant files, will be tracked with the Computerized Maintenance Management System, which is in the process of being upgraded.  The detailed maintenance procedures have been developed and training has been implemented.\n\n1.3.6  Management of Change\nA change review procedure has been developed to clearly define the necessary steps for any major process changes.
