The Pelican Rapids facility is subject to the US EPA?s Risk Management Program (EPA 40 CFR Part 68) Accidental Chemical Release Regulation, because the refrigeration system contains more than the thresholds quantity (10,000 lbs) of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nProcess Description\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at the facility is a two-stage system consisting of a high pressure side and a low pressure side.  The low side is intended to quickly freeze product, while the high side is intended to refrigerate the product.  Equipment and piping carry the necessary gas, liquid, and saturated vapor throughout the system.\nThe ammonia system is protected by the specific safety systems including safety relief valves, engine room ventilation, safety interlocks and sensors. Our Refrigeration Operators perform daily walk through inspections and a scheduled preventative maintenance program is in place for all equipment, piping and valves in the ammonia system.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe PSM Team has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of ammonia by using the worst case and alternative case scenarios.  The Process Safety Management Program (OSHA 1910.119) has been implemented.  Through the PSM Programs written procedures, operator training, employee awareness training, contractor programs, management of change, and Process Hazard Analysis our team of engineering, operations, maintenance and safety personnel are dedicated to ensuring the safety of people, property and the environment.\n\nAccident History\nThere have been no accidental release of ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage onsite or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\nEmergency Response Program\nOur facility has an Emergency Response Program for handling emergencies.
