      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary for RMP of North Industrial Chemicals Inc.\n\nNorth Industrial Chemicals, Inc. is committed to the responsible distribution and the safe handling of all chemicals under our jurisdiction.  This has been and is a priority concern of management/owners of this company for the past 20 years of my involvement.  We believe in providing the best in safety equipment and excellence in training.  Violation of safety regulations has not been nor will it be tolerated.\n\nOur company handles roughly 50 million pounds of product over the course of a year.  Half of this amount is hazardous material - flammables, corrosives, oxidizers, and poisons.   Of the hazardous materials warehoused, twelve products are repackaged here from 4,000 to 8,000 gallon tanks into drums or other containers for sale to industrial customers within a 150 mile radius of York.  Most all of our chemicals are shipped to our customers in our own trucks.  With North Industiral  Chemicals, Inc. at this facility are two other family owned corporations:  Compound Technology, Inc. which blends solid and liquid products primarily for the metal finishing industry and North Metal & Chemical Company which manufacturers primarily Sodium Molybdate and Calcium Tungstate and secondarily other molybdenum and tungsten products.  The RMP for NIC is limited to chlorine because this is the only EHS present in over threshold quantities at our facility.  \n\nThe worst case scenario which we have addressed in the RMP is a release of chlorine gas from a maximum inventory of 100 x 150# cylinders in a 10 minute release period.  While we believe this to be extremely hypothetical, it does paint the maximum impact to our community.  Using EPA's RMP model we estimate an impact area of 3.8 miles from our plant, affecting 116,080 people.  Alternately, a release of a single chlorine cylinder of 150# would impact an area of 0.2 miles and 4050 people.  In 30 years we have never had a release of more than 1 or 2 pounds of chlorine."

      "SummaryText": "NIC complies with all OSHA, EPA, DEP, DOT, and other regulatory agency requirements for safely handling chemicals.  Our membership in the National Association of Chemical Distributors, NACD, and compliance with their Responsible Distribution Process program and audits, and our standing as an ISO9002 certified company with biannual audits, shows the committment of our organization to safety.  All of these systems have stringent documented training requirements.  The specific requirements of 29 CFR  1910.119 PSM and 1910.120 were written in March, l997, concerning our handling of chlorine and ammonia, along with our updated contingency plan and our procedures for on site response to chemical spills.\n\nWe have had no reportable accidents within the last 5 years.  Minor incidents have been handled appropriately and reported to York Emergency Management Agency for information purposes.  We have participated with our LEPC in regular meetings, designing an Off-Site Emergency Plan and going through a terrorism exercise with PEMA.\n\nOur safety improvement will be realized with continued focus on training and commitment to quality, to productivity,  to customer service, and to the surrounding community."
