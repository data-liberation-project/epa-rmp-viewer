Hill Brothers Chemical Company staff is well trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facilities to provide safeguards, while effectively employing these chemicals.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has an emergency response plan in effect to handle potential emergency situations at this facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n \nHill Brothers Chemical Company policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental releases of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the Federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and CalARP.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains its employees at this facility to properly handle and store hazardous materials to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.

A designated Emergency Coordinator (EC) and an alternate EC initiate emergency notifications and evacuations.  All employees are trained in their appropriate role in emergency response and proper procedures for awareness level response.  The City of Industry Facility maintains a cooperative relationship with the Fire Department to ensure a full understanding of normal storage practices and emergency response and evacuation procedures related to regulated substances.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nCity of Industry Facility stores, repackages, and distributes anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, aqueous ammonia is manufactured at the facility.  The facility also stores and distributes 150-pound chlorine cylinders to customers.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Railcar System\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Railcar Unloading System is used for unloading railcars directly into either the Storage Tank or the tank trucks.  The Storage Tank is used to transfer anhydrous ammonia to the tank truck.  During unloading, all the valves leading to the scrubber are in the closed position and the valves from the railcar to the Storage Tank or the tank-truck are open.  The compressor draws vapor from the Storage Tank or tank-truck and discharge into the railcar. This creates a pressure differential between the two tanks, which acts as the motive force for transferring anhydrous ammonia from the railcar into the Storage Tank or a tank-truck.  After the transfer to the Storage Tank or tank-truck is completed and before the Storage Tank or truck is disconnected, the hoses are evacuated (depressurized) to allow for disconnecting the system.  The ammonia vapor in the line flows under its own pressure towards the scrubber until the pressure drops almost below gauge level.  The scrubber tower is packed by special packing material that will break the flow of water downward into small streams and droplets to"

The system is equipped with remotely operated emergency shut off system.  The emergency shutoff switch is placed at several locations, which close several valves on the liquid line limiting the amount of ammonia available for release.  Also, the railcars and tanker trucks are equipped with excess flow valves on their liquid lines that shut off if the flow rate exceeds a certain rate.  Aqueous ammonia manufacturing is a part of this system.  Anhydrous ammonia is pumped from the system supplied from either the attached railcar or a tank-truck and mixed with water in a reaction chamber to create aqueous ammonia.   \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Repackaging, Storage and Distribution Process\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia Repackaging, Storage and Distribution Process consists of a truck unloading station, a pressurized storage tank, a holding vessel and pump for cylinder filling, a cylinder fill station, ammonia recovery equipment, piping and valves.  The ammonia recovery equipment includes a recovery vessel, liquid overfill vessel, and ammonia compressors. To fill a cylinder with ammonia, liquid ammonia is first transferred from the Anhydrous Ammonia Storage Vessel to the Holding Vessel.  The Holding Vessel operates at ambient temperature and is pressurized by the Ammonia Storage Vessel.  The pump draws liquid anhydrous ammonia from the Holding Vessel, discharging to the Cylinder Fill Station.  The line is protected by manual shut-off valves at each end.  The Cylinder Fill Station is operated only when two operators are present.  \n\nChlorine Warehouse\n\nThe Chlorine Warehouse Process consists of a warehouse building, a truck loading/unloading dock and indoor storage racks for 150-lb cylinders of chlorine.  These cylinders are received at the northeast corner of the warehouse loading dock.   All cylinders are inspected upon arrival at the facility to ensure t"

Cylinders are restrained in the upright position during transport and storage.  Cylinders are stored outdoors beneath the warehouse canopy.  Generally, they remain in storage for less than two weeks before being loaded onto trucks for delivery to customers.  The chlorine is shipped in cylinders compliant with DOT requirements. The building is equipped with a heat and smoke detection system and an automatic fire sprinkler system.  The building is designed for extreme weather and seismic conditions as required by the Uniform Building Code.  \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company has a PSM program in place to manage the handling of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine, which complies with Federal RMP, CalARP and PSM requirements.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.  \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqueous Ammonia\n\nHill Brothers Chemical Company prevention program emphasizes risk management thorough use of equipment rated for ammonia service; training for its employees in hazard communication; proper operating procedures for the ammonia systems; level, pressure and temperature limits for process equipment and storage tanks; impleme"

Two trained operators are always present during bulk transfer to ensure safe operation and movement of trucks on the property and the integrity of hoses used for filling.  Operators are always present during repackaging operations to observe pressure and temperature gauges on tanks and pipes and to be alert for any releases of pressure relief valves installed on tanks or hydrostats on piping systems. In accordance with DOT requirements, valve assemblies on anhydrous ammonia cylinders are inspected upon each return for refilling.  Faulty valves are rebuilt or replaced.  The date stamped for hydrostatic testing of cylinders is checked and each cylinder is repainted for corrosion protection before refilling.  Hill Brothers Chemical Company trains their operators carefully before allowing them to take the lead in repackaging operations.  A key training method for process operations involves on-the-job supervision over extended time periods, using repeated demonstration of correct process steps in accordance with written procedures. \n\nChlorine\n\nWith respect to the chlorine cylinder warehouse process, Hill Brothers Chemical Company standard operating procedures include routine observation of container integrity during loading and unloading of these cylinders.
