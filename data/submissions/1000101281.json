This definition specifically excludes responses to incidental releases, which are those where the substance can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. If the release of chemical is substantial or clearly growing , the leak is no longer considered incidental and employees should not respond unless they are specifically trained in response procedures and the facility has an emergency response program that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95. \n\nFor non-responding facilities, an emergency action plan must include these elements:  (1) emergency escape procedures and emergency escape route assignments; (2) procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate; (3) procedures to account for all employees after emergency evacuation has been completed; (4) rescue and medical duties for those employees who are to perform them; (5) the preferred means of reporting fires and other emergencies; and (6) names or regular job titles of persons or departments who can be contacted for further information or explanation of duties under the plan.\n\nCWL&P has an emergency action plan in place to address and react to accidental releases of hazardous materials.

Hot Work Permits - CWL&P has developed and implemented a hot work permit program to be used whenever hot work operations are conducted on or near the SCR process.  The hot work permit must be issued and signed by the appropriate supervisory personnel.\n\nL.  Contractors - CWL&P develops partnerships with contractors to effectively conduct business and maintain generation facilities, especially in maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, CWL&P evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including its safety performance.

The requirements for non-responding facilities are covered in Section 68.90 of the rule.  For these facilities, an emergency action plan is required.  For a responding facility, the requirements are covered in Section 68.95 of the rule and a much more comprehensive emergency response plan is needed.  \n\nTo determine whether a facility is a responding one, the EPA interpretation of response is commonly used.

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\n\nF.  Management of Change - CWL&P maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures and monitoring technology.  Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address new requirements.\n\nG.

The analyses, in the form of workshops, were conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations and facilitated by a person trained in the assessment methodology used.  The findings and recommendations that resulted from the workshops were addressed.  The What-If analysis was initially conducted on May 15-17, 2002 and a review of that PHA was conducted on August 27-28, 2002.  A pre-startup safety review of the system was conducted prior to the ammonia arriving on-site. A PHA for Dallman unit 4 was conducted from October 2008 through January 2009.

The new Dallman unit 4 is also equipped with a baghouse, scrubber and wet ESP.  \n\nThe SCR process requires the use of anhydrous ammonia. The anhydrous ammonia storage facility includes two 50,000-gallon storage tanks with supporting unloading equipment, vapor compressors, piping to convey the liquid ammonia, vaporizers to convert ammonia from a liquid to a gas, and a gas dilution and injection system to inject ammonia into the SCR emission control system.  For the purpose of the RMP, anhydrous ammonia is the only one regulated substance at the facility.  With two 50,000-gallon storage tanks, the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the storage facility at any time is 468,340 pounds and the maximum amount contained in the largest single vessel is 233,520 pounds.\n\nIII. Description of Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program is arguably the most important element of the RMP.  Its successful implementation requires the active participation of plant employees and managers in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If a prevention program could be perfect, there would be little need for emergency response activities, since no unexpected releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program lowers the possibility of an accidental release and minimizes the consequences of a release should once occur.  The prevention program for the Dallman SCR process consists of twelve elements, which are briefly described here.\n\nA.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nEmployee safety and environmental protection are the drivers for City Water, Light & Power (CWL&P) policies at our Dallman Power Station.  In our view, environmental protection includes the health and welfare of the community surrounding Dallman.  This is why CWL&P has installed selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment to reduce air pollution and use ammonia as the most efficient chemical in the industry to accomplish this reduction.  The use of ammonia means that CWL&P must develop and implement a risk management plan to prevent the accidental release of ammonia to the atmosphere.  We have done so and provide a description of that plan here.\n\nCWL&P is committed to environmental leadership in managing its generating station for the public benefit, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power.  CWL&P also assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities, which include the safe and responsible use of chemicals for air pollution reduction.  CWL&P management and employees are responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties.

All such activities are conducted in accordance with the most current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\nII.
