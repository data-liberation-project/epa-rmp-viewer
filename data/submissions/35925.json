The RM plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia at Heinz Frozen Foods. The facility Risk Management Plan provides a general overview of the requirements and defines the Heinz Frozen Foods design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with the requirements.  In most instances, Heinz Frozen Foods has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with 40 CFR Part 68 rules as a result of other regulatory programs and requirements.  \n\n1.1. \tCorporate Commitment to Safety\n\nHeinz Frozen Foods is committed in providing to all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  To this end, we are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the environment remains as safe and healthful as possible.\n\n1.1.1. \tIt is the policy of Heinz Frozen Foods to:\n\n1.1.1.1 \tProvide safe working conditions, proper tools, and personal protective equipment.\n\n1.1.1.2 \tComply with all federal, state, and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations.\n\n1.1.1.3 \tProvide and sustain a high level of commitment to ensure all employees have a safe and healthy work environment in which to work.\n\n1.1.1.4 \tEnsure, through training, and when necessary disciplinary action, that all employees work in a safe manner.\n\n1.1.1.5 \tEducate and/or train all employees in safe work practices, and ensure that each employee fully understands his or her job, equipment, techniques, and methods to reduce the risk to himself or herself and their co-workers."

      "SummaryText": "1.1.2. \tEncourage all employees to \"Think Safety\", so that safety habits developed and practiced at work carry through to non-work related activities.\n\n1.1.3. \tThis facilities aim is to provide a professional service as efficiently as possible while minimizing the use of toxic materials where ever and whenever prudent.  In this effort our highest priority will be the proactive pursuit of cost-effective process changes that reduce or eliminate the use and/or generation of hazardous toxics at the endpoint of service.  Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, improving controls to handle these substances will be explored and implemented wherever possible.\n\n1.1.4. \tHeinz Frozen Foods has prepared a facility safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility. In addition, a Process Safety Management Program has also been established regarding the ammonia process.  It is the responsibility of designated facility personnel to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5. \tThe first duty of Heinz Frozen Foods employees is to exercise care in the performance of his/her work tasks to prevent an accident to him/herself, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2. \tFacility Description\n\nHeinz Frozen Foods is a food processing facility where food ingredients are received, blended, mixed, cooked, assembled, frozen and packaged for shipment to end users. A total of 850 employees work at the facility in a three shift schedule  There is a minimum of two operators on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\n1.2.1. \tThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site, in various locations and quantities is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1.2.2. \tAnhydrous Ammonia is utilized on site for the \"Process System The ammonia is contained in various vessels, ac"

The machine room, which houses the majority of the refrigeration machinery and motor control center, is located on the northwest side of the facility.\n\n1.3. \tWorst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n1.3.1. \tAs required by EPA guidelines, worst case and alternate-case release scenarios were calculated for the facility. ALOHA, (Areal Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres) modeling software, combined with Landview V mapping programs and the 2000 Census Bureau records were used for the scenario predictions. The release scenario data is maintained on file at the Heinz Frozen Foods facility.  \n\n1.4. \tEmergency Response Program\n\n1.4.1. \tHeinz Frozen Foods is equipped with an emergency warning system.  Alarms are placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees must follow in the event of release; which can be found in the Emergency Action Plan.  These procedures include evacuation of personnel, notification of authorities and actions to be taken to stop, or mitigate the emergency if it is safe to do so.\n\n1.4.2. \tPlant personnel have received emergency response training as outlined in OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation 29 CFR 1910.120 and other various rules and regulations. \n\n1.4.3. \tThe Local Emergency Planning Committee and local Fire Department has visited the facility to review the process operations, safety systems and discuss emergency response coordination."
