The RMP includes the preparation of Emergency Response Plans (ERP) that are tailored to each respective facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe New River Pump Station maintains an inventory of up to five (5) one-ton cylinders of liquified chlorine gas that is stored in the chlorination room of the chlorination/emergency generator building. A maximum of four (4) cylinders may be connected to vacuum regulators at any given time. An off-site analysis of \"Worst Case Release\" evaluating the release of a full one-ton cylinder in ten (10) minutes using EPA's atmospheric dispersion model determines a release exposure radius of 0.9 miles. The area has an estimated population of 1,153 based on uniform census data analysis. Areas effected by the \"Worst Case Release\" include the downtown section of East Radford, a portion of Radford University, and a portion of the community of Fairlawn. The analysis assumes the release of the largest cylinder, in an urban area with a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L in accordance with Emergency Response Guidelines as defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA). This  is the exposure level that individuals could experience for one (1) hour without serious health effects or symptoms that could impair the ability to take protective action. Based on the nature of chlorine (3.2 mg/L density), the terrain and population distribution, it is believed that a release would contact less than the projected population, and that the population with potential exposure would have adequate time to be evacuated. The development of this plan also includes an \"Alternative\" analysis of a type of release that is more likely to"

The \"Alternative\" analysis showed the area to be effected to be a 581 foot (0.11 Mile) radius, which would expose a portion of the community of Fairlawn, or a population estimate of 60 persons.\n\nThe \"Worst Case\" and \"Alternative\" analysis for the New River Pumping Station were conducted using EPA models and default conditions appropriate for the area. Using the above noted toxic endpoint concentrations, the models were conducted using stability factor \"F\" and wind speed of 1.5 meters/second for the \"Worst Case\" analysis, and a stability factor of \"D\" and a wind speed of 3 meters/second for the \"Alternative\" analysis. The models used uniform population densities that have been modified where adjustment due to land use is believed to be appropriate.\n\nThe \"Alternative\" analysis considered a leak of 1/4 inch in diameter. Potential leaks with the current vacuum feed system are believed to be those of minor nature involving a cracked valve, leaking/stripped connections, or broken gauge stems. Failures resulting in leaks greater that 1/4 inch in diameter, but less than \"Worst Case\", may be leaks such as blown valves, temperature release plugs, and major cylinder deterioration. These types of leaks are not believed to be very probable. Overall, no reportable leaks (10 pounds or greater) have occurred since the Authority began providing service in 1987.\n\nChlorine gas release potential is mitigated by having full cylinders stored indoors. In addition, the gas handling system is vacuum regulated so that the probable leak (alternative analysis) sources are at the cylinder connection areas. The chlorine system is equipped with leak detection equipment that alarms at the local site as well as the operator control room at the main treatment plant.\n\nThe Authority's PSM Plan and RMP are based on several key elements:\n1) Operator Training\n2) Preventive Maintenance\n3) Process and safety equipment based on current technologies\n4) Safety inspections, process hazard analysis, and"

The Authority depends on local emergency services to repair such leaks and evacuate areas it deems necessary for the protection of life. This course of action pertains to most situations in which the emission of gas cannot readily be stopped by valving and/or capping the gas source to stop the leak."
