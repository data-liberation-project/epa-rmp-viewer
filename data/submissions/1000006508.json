Executive Summary\n\nThis Risk Management Plan for Vogel Paint & Wax Co., Inc. covers a single 18,000-gallon bulk storage vessel, used to store a flammable mixture of propane and isobutane. This flammable mixture is used as a propellant in aerosol paint cans. All current applicable ANSI standards are strictly followed regarding the maintenance and operation of this facility.\n\nVogel Paint & Wax Co., Inc. is a producer of liquid and powder architectural and industrial coatings. One of the processes that is performed at the facility is the production of aerosol (spray) paint. The propellant that is used to pressurize these aerosol paints is the flammable mixture of propane and isobutane. The flammable mixture is stored on-site, in an 18,000-gallon bulk storage vessel, and transferred from the bulk storage vessel to the aerosol production facility by a 1,000-gallon portable nurse tank. All parts on the storage vessel and the nurse tank are designed for propane use.\n\nThe facilities and bulk storage vessel are manned seven days a week, 24 hours per day. Production at the facility is performed during normal, single shift, business hours and a security guard is on-site during all non-production time.\n\nVogel Paint & Wax Co., Inc. has had no flammable mixture leaks within the last five years. Even though the company has had no releases it still coordinates annual visits with the local fire department to review the facility and the emergency response procedures the company has in place.\n\nVogel Paint & Wax Co., Inc. has taken several steps to insure the integrity and safety for accident prevention.\n1. The flammable mixture storage and transfer system adheres to all applicable ANSI, ASTM, NFPA, and OSHA requirements.\n2. Annual training is required for all personnel handling, transferring, or transporting the flammable mixture. The training includes properties of all components, safe handling practices, first ai"
