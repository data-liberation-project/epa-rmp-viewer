The maximum quantity released would be 140,196pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\nb)\tThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a pipe.

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Based on these evalustions the facility has installed break-a-ways on the risers to prevent release of ammonia in the event that a nurse tank pulls away from the loading area before the hose has been disconnected.  The break-a-way devises allow for complete shut down of the hose end and the valve on the riser pipe thus prevening any relaseas.\n\nThere are no other additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendatio at this time."
