The Facility Policy.\n\nThe Owners, management and employees of UNITED FARM INDUSTRIS, INC are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.    Facility Information.\n\n  \n?    The facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for sale to farmer customers\n?    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n?    The maximum quantity stored would be 280,392 pounds.  Stored in two 30,000-gallon storage tanks.\n?    \n\n3.    The Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\na)    The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,196pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.10 miles.\nb)    The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4.    The accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-611.1? published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, ?storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.?\n\n5.    The Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\na)    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\nb)    To our knowledge have resulted in offs"

The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Facility has:\n\na)    A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38\nb)    Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\nc)    A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.210, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Based on these evalustions the facility has installed break-a-ways on the risers to prevent release of ammonia in the event that a nurse tank pulls away from the loading area before the hose has been disconnected.  The break-a-way devises allow for complete shut down of the hose end and the valve on the riser pipe thus prevening any relaseas.\n\nThere are no other additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendatio at this time."
