This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n \n Training\n \n To complement the written procedures for process operations, the El Dorado Propane Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees.  New operational employees receive training on the El Dorado Propane Terminal's operating procedures and basic training in process operations, if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  T"

The El Dorado Propane Terminal is able to store enough of propane to meet the minimum RMP reporting quantities.\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) for the El Dorado Propane Terminal is a vapor cloud explosion involving the largest inventory of a flammable mixture (predominately consisting of propane) contained in a single pressurized storage vessel.  The maximum quantity possible contained within this storage vessel is 160,000 pounds.  Although administrative controls are in place to limit this quantity, those controls were not considered in calculating this maximum quantity determination.  The entire inventory of the storage tank is assumed to release, forming a vapor cloud, igniting and exploding - creating a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE).  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the 1-psig overpressure endpoint is 0.4 miles.  Although there are numerous controls to prev"

      "SummaryText": "ent such releases, and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) that is used as a planning case at the El Dorado Propane Terminal is a 4 diameter pressure relief safety valve lifts due to an overfill causing a release of pressurized propane to the atmosphere at a rate of 1,432 pounds per minute.  This particular ARS is assumed to last for 5 minutes before operation of isolation valves, pumps, deluge, shutdowns and/or other mitigating actions can be utilized to mitigate the release.  Under this ARS, the released propane vapor is accidentally ignited - causing a vapor cloud fire.  Using RMP*CompTM, the maximum distance to the Lower Flammability Limit endpoint for this ARS is 0.1 mile.  With a radius of 0.1 miles, this ARS would extend outside of the boundary of the El Dorado Propane Terminal.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.\n\n\n\n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n \n  The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Facility.  The process at the El Dorado Propane Terminal is regulated by both the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Because RMP accident prevention requirements for this process are essentially the same as PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements, and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program at the El Dorado Propane Terminal.  \n \n Employee Participation\n \n The El Dorado Propane Terminal encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention, including process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and the development of operating and maintenance procedures.
