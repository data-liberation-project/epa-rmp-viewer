      "SummaryText": "Atlas Pipeline Mid Continent LLC (ATLAS) owns and operates a natural gas processing facility, the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant, in Beckham County, Oklahoma.   The plant is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\n\nSection 112\u00ae of the Clean Air Act applies to the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant because the plant handles and stores methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane in excess of threshold quantities.  Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\n\n1. \u00a7112\u00ae(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  ATLAS is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community.  ATLAS, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the Sayre/Sweetwater Fire Department.\n\n2. Risk Management Plan - The Sweetwater Gas Processing Plant processes natural gas, recovering natural gas liquids and producing pipeline quality natural gas.  This process involves the handling and storage of chemicals in excess of thresholds specified in \u00a7112\u00ae. ATLAS management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids.  Programs have been established to prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emergency resp"

      "SummaryText": "onse in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nFor planning purposes, ATLAS has considered the impact of a worst case accident, defined to be a 35,000 gallon release from a Y-Grade product or HD5 Mix 90,000 gallon tank resulting in the instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which explodes. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 39% of the maximum tank capacity. Using the EPA OCA Guidance Equations a potential radius of impact due to the explosion was calculated to extend to 0.44 miles.  Global positioning system (GPS) locations were gathered on surrounding area residences that could conceivably fall into the worst case catastrophic event, and it was determined that there were none within 0.44 mile radius.   It should be emphasized that the probability of the worst-case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote - far less than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury.  A consideration of the 0.44-mile radius has been incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\nATLAS has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases.  ATLAS has active operating, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures.  ATLAS provides annual emergency response training to its employees. In addition, ATLAS has coordinated with local emergency responders including the Sayre/Sweetwater Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nATLAS's management is committed to the following:\n- Preventing accidents;\n- Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with ATLAS operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n- Being a"
