      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n \r\n1.0    SOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Roberts Dairy located in Des Moines, Iowa, is subject to the USEPAs \r\nRisk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation \r\n(40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than \r\nthe threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) \r\n(CAS Number 7664-41-7).  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient \r\nconditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used to \r\ncontrol the processing and storage temperature for milk, juice, cream, and \r\nflavored drinks.  It is a closed system that contains approximately 13,000 \r\npounds (i.e., 2,400 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, \r\nliquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure \r\nreceiver that operates at approximately 150 psig and can contain as much \r\nas 5,011 pounds of liquid ammonia.  However, during typical operation, \r\nthe vessel holds only about 2,000 pounds.  Most of the ammonia \r\nequipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, \r\nand some piping runs are located outdoors.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \r\nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \r\nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \r\npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \r\nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \r\npiping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by \r\nsmell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe Roberts Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage system.  \r\nThe high pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (150 to 180 psig) liquid \r\nammonia to a recirculator.  The recirculator provides high-pressure \r\nammonia to all of the cooling units via dual liquid pumps.  The cooling \r\nunits include the following:  glycol chillers (2), cooler evaporat"

A high-level pumper drum returns liquid ammonia from the \r\nrecirculator to the receiver.  Ammonia vapor is returned to six high-stage \r\ncompressors.  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \r\ngas), at 150 to 180 psig, is vented to four evaporative condensers.  The \r\ncondensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \r\nsafety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room \r\nventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the \r\ncompressor discharge, condensers, pumper drum, and recirculator from \r\nthe hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high \r\npressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as \r\nwell as high level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts \r\nfor the compressors are set at 200 psig.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases of \r\nammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from \r\nleaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent \r\nreleases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact \r\nemployees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or \r\nrepresent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the property line).  Moreover, a release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\r\n\r\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture an"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\r\n\r\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\r\n\r\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if/checklist\" technique.

The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\r\n\r\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\r\n\r\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\r\n\r\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \r\n\r\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.
