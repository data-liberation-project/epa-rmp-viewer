This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  It is the practice of T E Products Pipeline Company, L P (TEPPCO) Products Operating L.P. (TEPPCO) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Eagle Terminal located in Chester County, Pennsylvania is owned by T E Products Pipeline Company, LP and is operated by TEPPCO.  \n\nThe Eagle Terminal is a wholesale terminal facility for the storage and loading of propane.  The propane is received from a T E Products Pipeline underground pipeline and is stored in any of eighteen above ground 30,000 gallon nominal capacity storage tanks.  The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tank into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the truck filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection.\n\nThe Eagle Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  TEPPCO identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on facility knowledge.  Propane and ethyl mercaptan are the only listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Eagle Terminal.  The Terminal is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Pr"

There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Eagle Terminal.  The processes at the terminal are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the terminal?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all aspects of safety and health issues concerning the employees and the public.\n\nTEPPCO strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a ?near-miss? reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nTEPPCO actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  TEPPCO keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nTEPPCO also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to insure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Eagle Terminal has a comprehensive program to help insure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazar"

The analyses are conducted using a team of TEPPCO staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps insure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Eagle Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for"
