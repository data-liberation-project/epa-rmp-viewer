This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n \n DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n \n The Chevron USA Production McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant, located near McKittrick, California, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, natural gasoline) from natural gas. The Chevron USA Production McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant has several regulated flammables, such as propane and natural gasoline. Additionally, the Chevron USA Production McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant uses sodium hypochlorite, ethylene glycol and ethyl mercaptan, which are also regulated substances but these chemicals are under threshhold limits.\n \n OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULT\n \n The WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in the Program Level 1 process at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion of the largest storage tank containing propane.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 90% of the maximum tank capacity (190,000 lbs.) however the likelihood of filling the storage tank to 100% capacity (210,000 lbs.) still exist and is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation"

New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral and written tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted every year.  All of these training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \n Contractors\n \n The Chevron USA Production McKittrick 17Z Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.
