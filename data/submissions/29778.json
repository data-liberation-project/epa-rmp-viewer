As requested by the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services they are resubmitting the original RMP with revised and updated information. Part of the expansion included additional safety measures of increased diffusion tank capacity, additional emergency ventilation for the mechanical room and rupture disc?s on all Safety Relief Valves.  \nThis RMP resubmission includes; Executive Summary, Registration, Offsite Consequence Analysis, 5 year Accident History, Prevention Program 3, Emergency Response Program, Certification and Updates. \nA current detailed copy of RMP, and Prevention Program including PHA materials can be reviewed at the facility by contacting Lawrence Sambado. \nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). This facility will not make specific RMP or OCA information available to the public until a final ruling is made. Any accidental or authorized release of information in section 2-5 by government officials violates Federal Law.\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at A Sambado & Son, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass growing, packing, processing, storage and shipping of fresh produce.  We have 1 regulated substance above federal thresholds present at our facility.  The su"

Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as refrigerant in a closed loop flooded ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, alternative release scenario analysis we have used the EPA?s RMP*Comp?.  The EPA?s Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration was used as a reference.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the largest vessel.  In this scenario 20,269 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the High Pressure receiver #4.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  There are no mitigation measures.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a gas release typical of a compressor shaft seal failure.  The scenario involves a gas release from a ?? diameter hole with a pressure of 181 PSIG/95?F. The release rate is 12 pounds/min. inside an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.06 miles which is reported as <.1 miles.\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The fol"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is ?What if Checklist?.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 yrs..  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/13/01.\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, A Sambado & Son, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\nTraining\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\nMechanical Integrity\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at A Sambado & Son, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 01/15/2001.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at A Sambado & Son, Inc..  The most recent review was performed on 04/27/2003.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\nCompliance Audits\nA Sambado & Son, Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.
