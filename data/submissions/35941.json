      "SummaryText": "The Borough of Hanover owns and operates a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) whose service area includes Hanover and McSherrystown Boroughs, as well as Conewego Township and a portion of Penn Township, all in Adams County, Pennsylvania.  The WWTP, located at the end of O=Brien Lane in Conewego Township, processes up to 4.5 million gallons per day of wastewater and discharges to the South Branch Conewego Creek under NPDES Permit No. PA0026875.   Wastewater treatment processes include grit and coarse screenings removal, primary sedimentation, secondary activated sludge treatment, clarification, filtration, disinfection, and de-chlorination.  Solid material removed from this process is stabilized in anaerobic digesters, dewatered, and utilized for agricultural purposes through land application.  The plant is operated 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nThe WWTP includes a disinfection system comprised of a chlorine container room, which contains two (2) one ton containers of chlorine liquefied under pressure, a chlorinator, various safety equipment, and instrumentation consisting of flow recorders, electrical panels, and a gas detector/alarm unit.  Up to six (6) one ton containers may be on site simultaneously.  The chlorinator system extracts chlorine gas from the storage containers through vacuum regulators and dissolves this gas in water to form a disinfection solution that is used to kill pathogenic bacteria and micro-organisms in the treated wastewater effluent prior to its discharge into the creek. Treatment plant operators regularly check the chlorinator room and its equipment, inventorying the rate of chlorine use and adjusting the rate as necessary.  The maximum intended inventory for planning purposes is 12,000 pounds.\n\n               To improve the water quality of the effluent discharged to the receiving stream, the WWTP utilizes sulfur dioxide gas, another regulated substance, to de-chlorinate its effluent through a process called \u00bfsulfonation\u00bf.
