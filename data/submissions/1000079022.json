      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n(a)    At FXI Inc., it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. We are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures are needed.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Facility Information and Regulated Substances handled\n\n\n\n(b)    FXI Inc. is located at 154 Lipford Rd in the Lee Industrial Park South in Verona, MS.  The facility manufactures flexible polyurethane foam, primarily for the furniture and bedding industry, and handles mixed isomers of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  TDI is regulated under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments.\n\n\n\nThe same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance. TDI is considered a toxic substance and associated safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as fire, explosion, or toxic release of TDI is possible. \n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n(c)    FXI uses this RMP and FXI best management practices as the primary programs for defining and guiding the Accidental Release Prevention Program for the facility.  The facility has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program (Level 1) due to the following factors:\n\n    1.    TDI is listed on CAA 112(r) and our process involves a quantity that exce"

This facility is eligible for Program  Level 1 because our worst-case release scenario for TDI has no potential to impact public receptors within our toxic endpoint distance.  \n\n    3.    This facility has not had any accidental releases in the last 5 years that have reached public receptors causing any deaths, injuries, or restoration of offsite receptors.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following seven (7) functions:\n\n\n\n    1.    Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment.\n\n    2.    Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that used regulated substances.\n\n    3.     Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs.\n\n    4.    Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes.\n\n    5.    Ensure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated using our incident investigation procedures and that relevant findings are communicated throughout the company to help prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nThe TDI process at our plant has hazards that are carefully managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The prevention program outlined above is applied to the TDI process. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors and by management system failures.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2)  quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI  process:\n\n\n\n    Release Containment/Control\n\n\n\n    a.    TDI st"

The drain cover is removed immediately after the tank truck load completes. Tanker trucks of TDI are not unloaded if heavy rains cause the area around the blocked storm drain to become flooded.\n\n\n\n    Release Quick Detection Systems\n\n\n\nTDI Unload operating procedures require unloading personnel to attend all TDI transfers from rail tank cars and tanker trucks in close proximity continually during the outdoor transfer operation.\n\nStationary TDI monitors have been added"

Our emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA's emergency action and fire prevention plan regulation, OSHA's hazardous waste and emergency operation regulation, the EPA's emergency response programs requirements in its RMP rule.  Our program contains procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a  release occurs, as well as post-incident clean-up and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities. Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and trained on those changes.\n\n    \n\n    The overall emergency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  Thi"

Our incident investigation program is especially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the processes.  The following changes have been implemented:\n\n        1.    Magnetic Site gauge cleaning for our two indoor tanks has been added to our preventative maintenance procedures.  This allows the gauges to provide to reliable level detection before any contamination inside the magnetic gauge could occur and lead to an overfill condition or an inaccuracy in measuring the TDI in-house inventory for the facility.\n\n    2.    Additional overfill protection on both of our indoor tanks to give protection if a high level device fails.  \n\n        3.    Added controls to limit railcar and truck unloading air pressure to 8 PSI.    \n\n        4.    Added stationary TDI monitors to detect any leaks at key locations.\n\n        5.      Added vacuum relief devices on both TDI tanks.\n\n        6.      Added pressure switch at railcar and truck unload to shut off pressure if it goes above 10 PSI."
