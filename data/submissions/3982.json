General accidental release and prevention policy of Alliant Foodservice.\n\nIn this frozen food distribution center we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous\nammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. The same properties\nthat make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety\nprecautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and\nthe environment.  \nIt is our policy at Alliant Foodservice to implement the requirements of the Risk Management\nProgram by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and\nstate regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental\nrelease of hazardous materials. Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia. Our\nplant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety\ndevices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nAlliant Foodservice, 8000 Bavaria Road, Twinsburg, Ohio, operates a refrigeration system\nutilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant.Mechanical refrigeration is a\nthermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to\nmaintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of\nevaporation, compression, condensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are\ndesigned to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and\nexpansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle\nis a closed loop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and la"

The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a\ndesired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area where it is of no\nconsequence.\n\nThe Alliant Foodservice facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain storage room\ntemperatures for various types of fresh and frozen food distributed to their customers. The\nrefrigeration system contains the following equipment: Three screw compressors, one evaporative\ncondensers, one high pressure receiver, one accumulator, one recirculator, one thermosyphon\ntank, twenty five cooler/freezer evaporators, a floor warming heat exchanger and a system purger.\nThe refrigeration system contains 13,500 pounds of Anydrous ammonia.\n\nThere are approximately 225 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel. \nThis distribution facility receives and prepares shipment of frozen and refrigerated food products\nvia tractor trailers approximately 24 hours a day, six days a week.  \n\n\n\nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not\nlimited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n \nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is it's pungent,\ndistinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small\nconcentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks. Risks from\naccidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The\nextent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  \nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn,\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a high heat ignition source.\n\n3.

This vessels normal operating level is 3,200 pounds of\nliquid ammonia,  approximately 50% of it's total capacity. Although the high pressure receiver is\ncapable of holding 6,400 pounds, this exceeds engineering controls which limit the liquid level to\na maximum of 80% at any time.
