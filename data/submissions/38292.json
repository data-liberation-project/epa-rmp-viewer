      "SummaryText": "Owned and operated by the City of Kalamazoo, Michigan, the Kalamazoo Water Reclamation Plant (KWRP) receives and treats wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial sources.  The City has contractural agreements with numerous surrounding governmental units and industries to treat wastewater generated outside the city limits of Kalamazoo.  The design flow rate is 54 million gallons per day (MGD) and the average daily flow rate is currently about 28 MGD.\n\nWastewater entering the KWRP receives pretreatment (screening), primary treatment (grit removal, clarification, etc.), secondary treatment (powdered activated carbon-enhanced activated sludge), and tertiary treatment (ammonia and phosphorus removal, chlorination and de-chlorination).\n\nThe KWRP uses chlorine to disinfect the treated wastewater prior to discharge to the Kalamazoo River.  Chlorine is a regulated chemical under OSHA's Process Safety Management rules and under USEPA's Chemical Accident Prevention rules.  Chlorine is delivered to the KWRP and used in one-ton containers.  Six to ten full chlorine containers are delivered to the site via truck by the supplier.  The containers are unloaded and stored in an outdoor, covered storage area.  The containers are moved into a chlorination room when needed.  In this room, KWRP staff connect the ton containers to the feed system.\n\nThe KWRP uses vacuum feed systems that are inherently safe.  These systems involve the use of water flowing through an eductor which creates a vacuum.  This vacuum allows for the feed of chlorine from the containers into the piping system.  If a chlorine line downstream of the vacuum regulator is broken or develops a leak, the vacuum is interrupted and the vacuum regulator automatically closes, preventing the discharge of chlorine.\n\nThe KWRP has developed a comprehensive, accidental release prevention program as part of the OSHA PSM program.  The elements of this program include:\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analy"

This plan, which has been submitted to the Local Emergency Planning Committee, contains measures that KWRP staff can take to alert employees to a release, personal protective equipment, how to distinguish between an incidental release and a significat release, and many other elements.  KWRP staff receive training to allow for offensive remedial action in response to an off-site release.  Some staff receive training for incident command practices.  In addition, the KWRP performs periodic drills of the emergency response plan."
