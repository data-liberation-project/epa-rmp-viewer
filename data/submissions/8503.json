      "SummaryText": "We are a fertilizer retail facility.  The materials considered hazardous at our facility are propane, anhydrous ammonia and aqua (a 20 wt% solution of ammonia in water).  Our facility has one 15,000 gallon propane storage tank, four atmospheric-pressure 28,000 gallon aqua ammonia storage tanks and storage tanks for other fertilizers that are not considered hazardous under provisions of the Risk Management Plan.  We also have equipment for receiving ammonia by rail, equipment for transferring ammonia from railcars to make aqua, and equipment for transferring aqua from storage to trucks for delivery to customers.  It is our policy to meet, or exceed, all local, state, and national standards relating to handling propane, anhydrous ammonia and aqua.\n\nIn the past five years, we have not had any accidents or releases with off-site consequences.\n\nSpecific safety features that we employ to minimize the impact of an accidental release include:\n\n1. Excess flow valves to prevent flow from propane storage if any hose or line breaks.\n2. Pressure relief valves on the propane storage tank and on the aqua reactor to prevent overpressuring and rupture of these vessels.\n3. Diking around the aqua storage area, to contain any accidental spills.\n\nTo further ensure safe operation of the facility, our employees are trained in procedures for safe handling of hazardous materials, and in safe operating and maintenance procedures.  We have also coordinated with the LaCrosse Volunteer Fire Department to respond in the unlikely event of an emergency.\n\nAs required by the EPA, we have analyzed the worst-case release scenarios defined by the EPA for both our propane storage and for anhydrous ammonia in railcars that may be at our facility.  For propane, the worst-case scenario involves a release of the entire contents of the propane storage tank.  For ammonia, it involves release of the entire contents of one railcar.  According to information supplied by the EPA the effect of the worst-case scena"

For ammonia the effect would extend 7 miles, and would include residences, a school, and the Central Ferry industrial area.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that an event such as EPAs worst-case release scenario will ever occur.  A more probable, but still highly unlikely event, would be an event like a hose break during a truck or railcar pull away.  According to information supplied by the EPA, the effect from such a release of propane would extend only 200 feet and would not include any residences, schools, or industrial areas.  For ammonia the effect would extend 2000 feet and would include several residences and the Central Ferry industrial area.  The effect from such a release of aqua would only extend 520 feet and would not include any residences, schools, or industrial areas."
