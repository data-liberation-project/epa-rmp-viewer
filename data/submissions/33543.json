      "SummaryText": "The Athens Utilities Board (AUB) owns and operates two wastewater treatment facilities that serve a total estimated population of 12,186 individuals in Athens, Tennessee.  The Oostanaula Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) treats waste for approximately two-thirds of this population, and utilizes chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for de-chlorination (sulfur dioxide amounts at the Oostanaula facility are below EPA RMP reporting requirements) prior to discharge at the permitted outfall (TN0024201). The North Mouse Creek facility uses UV disinfection and therefore has no treatment chemicals that are subject to RMP reporting requirements. The Oostanaula WWTP has a design capacity of 2.8 MGD.  Current chlorine management practices involve having two, one-ton cylinders on site at a given time, with one cylinder in use.  However, it is possible that supplier delivery schedules could result in as many as three, one-ton cylinders on-site at a given time.  If this occurred, one of the cylinders would only contain a small amount of chlorine.  Therefore, 5,000 pounds was the conservative maximum limit that was assumed for RMP reporting purposes.  Chlorine is the only chemical utilized above 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities.  There are no flammable chemicals or substances stored at the Oostanaula WWTP.This facility is also regulated under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  These involve implementing operational and maintenance procedures that limit the risk of an accidental release such as those modeled in the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) portion of the facility's Risk Management Plan (RMP).  PSM requirements also involve working closely with local emergency response personnel to limit the consequences of an accidental release were one to occur.  The Oostanaula WWTP has a schedule in place that requires periodic inspections of equipment used to load/unload chlorine, feed chlorine in our wastewater treatment process, and monitor the atmosphere for "

These inspections are documented by operating personnel and minimize the potential for equipment malfunctions or faulty cylinders that could lead to chlorine releases.  Operational procedures are also in place that outline specific steps to take when chlorine is loaded or unloaded, when putting a chlorine cylinder into service, when taking a chlorine cylinder out of service, and for normal operation.  These attempt to minimize operator errors that could cause a chlorine accident.  There are also preventative maintenance procedures in place where tubing and chlorination system parts are regularly replaced to minimize the potential for mechanical malfunctions that could cause chlorine releases.  Additionally, this facility has emergency procedures in place in the event a chlorine release should occur.  These specifically outline the steps that operators, management, and administrative personnel should take when an accidental release is discovered.  Periodically, emergency drills are performed in conjunction with local emergency response agencies, like the McMinn County Hazmat team and the Athens Fire Department.  Periodic training is also performed at the facility, where inspection, maintenance, and operational procedures are reviewed with plant operators.  This training serves not only to ensure our PSM operation, maintenance, and emergency response procedures are fully understood and being followed, but to identify any areas where current procedures need to be revised or new procedures implemented.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is also conducted periodically to identify situations that could cause a chemical release and to plan specific actions that would be taken to either minimize the chances for the situation to occur or mitigate the effects of a chemical release.  The Oostanaula WWTP is currently undergoing a major renovation/expansion project that will include the elimination of both chlorine and sulfur dioxide as process chemicals.  UV disi"
