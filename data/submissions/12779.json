This is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999.\n*Enhance the preventative maintenance process for tracking equipment records and status.  This is expected to be completed by December, 1999.\n*Continue to conduct tours with the local emergency responders to help them better understand and be prepared to assist in onsite emergency response.  The latest tours were conducted in April, 1999 and are expected to be conducted annually.\n* Conduct periodic drills for the site Emergency Response Team and participate in county emergency drills as appropriate\n\nCERTIFICATIONS\n\nFor all covered processes, the undersigned also certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the other information submitted in this RMPlan is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nSignature\nTitle:  Plant Manager\nDate:  June 21, 1999\n\nRMP DATA ELEMENTS\n\nThe following pages present additional information about our risk management program that EPA's RMP rule has asked us to provide.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY                         \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc., we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications required by EPA's RMP rule\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility packages high purity laboratory, microelectronic, and bulk pharmaceutical chemicals.  Our facility also accomplishes limited purification operations and some aqueous blending operations.  The Mallinckrodt Baker facility consists of a single building, approximately 350,000 square feet, and encompasses warehousing and packaging operations as well as unloading facilities for rail cars and tank trucks.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals in quantities that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxic"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals - Chloroform\n\nThe worst case scenario is a catastrophic failure of the bulk receiving vessel, resulting in the loss of the entire contents, 46,000 lbs. in ten minutes.  Liquid spilled will be contained in a diked area from which the vapors can be blanketed and the spill cleaned up.  Vapors from the evaporating liquid will be dispersed downwind with the plume width being approximately 200 feet.  The estimated distance to the 92 ppm exposure endpoint is 0.4 mile (2100 feet).  The offsite impact would include approximately 150 individuals located along a street to the west and in a subdivision to the north.  Additionally, a business directly across the highway to the south, and farmland to the east would be affected.\n\nThe unloading area is in a containment area which will hold the entire contents of the vessel and provides an area in which a spill could be covered to minimize evaporation and cleaned up.  Pressure testing of the vessels, video surveillance, operator observation, and periodic inspection of the unloading systems minimize the likelihood of this event.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals - Chloroform\n\nThe alternative scenario is a leak occu"

It is expected that, should this scenario occur, the duration will be a maximum of 1 hour.  The distance to the 92 ppm exposure endpoint is estimated to be less than 0.1 mile (528 feet) which will have no offsite impact.\n\nManagement systems in place requiring the operator to frequently walk the lines to check for leaks as well as the utilization of video surveillance, and positive tie down of the hose fittings minimize the potential for this scenario to occur.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Flammable Chemicals - Ethyl Ether\n\nThe worst case scenario is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) following the catastrophic failure of the bulk vessel at its maximum volume of 48,000 lbs.  The estimated distance to the 1 psig overpressure endpoint is 0.1 mile which would produce no offsite impact.  Based on this analysis, Ethyl Ether is a Program 1 material and no alternative release scenario is required.\n\nThe unloading vessel is periodically pressure tested in accordance with DOT requirements which will minimize the likelihood of this event occurring.\n\nThe unloading system is periodically inspected, the area is under video surveillance, the systems are controlled by remote shut off valves for early shutdown, and all electrical systems in the area are hazard rated for the area.  These systems for early leak detection and shut off and the electrical systems combine to minimize the potential for a leak occurring undetected and subsequently being ignited to produce a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental release"
