Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the Facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards. However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Facility located at 211 E 500 N, Urbana, IN 46990. The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nThe Facility is submitting this to reflect the most recent update and review of the RMP since it's acquisition by Helena. The RMP was revised to the RMP standards implemented by Helena.  All RMP Facility details are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\r\n\r\n\r\nFACILITY\r\n\r\nThe Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck and then transferred to one (1) 8,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel. The commercial tanker truck operator (Contractor) performs these transfer operations.\r\n\r\nThe Facility stores the anhydrous ammonia in the on-site stationary pressure vessel an"

This Facility owns and operates (8) 1,500-gallon nurse tanks and\r\n(30) 1,000-gallon nurse tanks. Trained Facility Operators perform the transfer operation in accordance with the RMPr accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the single covered\r\nprocess that is operated at this Facility. The covered process includes anhydrous ammonia Storage\r\nand Handling. The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumes that all the contents\r\nin the largest single storage tank are released. For this Facility, the largest vessel is an 8,000-gallon stationary pressure vessel. The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario was completed for the storage and handling\r\ncovered process as well. The alternative release for the Storage and Handling assumes a 30-second release from a ruptured 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer hose during a loading or unloading operation. Active mitigation considered in this release scenario includes the activation of a backflow check valve, excess flow valves, and emergency shutoff valves on the storage tank side of the bulkhead, and operating procedures that the Facility uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility. The Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed. The Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis"
