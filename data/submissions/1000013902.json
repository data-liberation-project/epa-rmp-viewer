Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the federal Accidental Release Prevention (RMP) Program requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered process as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to an ammonia release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR 1910.38.\n\nThis facili"

Glanbia is responsible for running the plant production, warehousing, and distribution, while SMP and DFA guarantee the milk requirements of the plant, which are approximately 10.5 million pounds milk per day.  The 300,000 square foot facility lies on a 3,000-acre site southwest of the town of Clovis, New Mexico.\n\nConsidered to be North AmericaA?s largest cheddar cheese production plant, the facility produces blocks of cheese weighing up to 640 pounds.  Annual production reaches 280 million pounds of cheese and 18.5 million pounds of whey proteins using 2.7 billion pounds of milk.  The facility employs approximately 290 workers.\n\nProject design was provided by Power Engineers of Hailey, Idaho and E.A. Bonelli & Associates of Oakland, California.  Dahlgren Group of Seattle, Washington and the Carlisle Group from Minnesota constructed the plant.  Applied Process Cooling Corporation (APCCO) of Modesto, California designed and installed the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe Southwest Cheese Company plant is located at 1141 Curry Road 4 about six miles south of Clovis and Highways 60/84 and about two miles west of Highway 70.  The Clovis site was chosen for its proximity to a large, well-developed dairy producing region.  The plant is surrounded by approximately 100 acres of grassland and wheat and there are two large dairies about"

There are approximately 35,000 people living in Clovis, which was incorporated in 1909.  Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast.\n\n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nThe single stage system has been designed with six (6) Vilter screw compressor packages and four (4) rooftop BAC evaporative condensers.  Screw compressor oil cooling is accomplished with a thermosiphon cooling recirculation arrangement using a thermosiphon receiver and liquid from the condenser drain line.\n\nHigh pressure liquid ammonia is drained from the evaporative condensers to the high-pressure receiver.  The receiver provides liquid to the recirculator vessel for direct cooling in the evaporator coils via the recirculator package ammonia pumps.  A liquid transfer vessel returns excess pumped liquid to the high-pressure receiver.  The recirculator package also provides liquid for glycol cooling via three (3) glycol heat exchangers.  A fourth heat exchanger utilizes liquid ammonia for polishing water cooling.\n\nThere is a single oil pot in the system at the recirculator.  The vessel is equipped with a self-closing spring-loaded drain valve for safety.  All pressure vessels in the system have dual safety relief valves (SRV's) to protect the respective vessel against overpressure conditions.  All SRV's relieve to atmosphere from a common discharge pipe on the roof.  An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain an efficient refrigeration process.\n\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof, while the evaporators are located in rooftop penthouse units above the storage cooling and rapid cooling areas.  The evaporator coils are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line.\n\nA Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and compressor microprocessors provide system management and control.  Level columns are provided on most vessels "

Additional safeguards include an emergency shutdown system, ventilation and detection, manual stop valves, and compressor safety cutouts.\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan details the notification and evacuation procedures in the event of a release.  Drills are conducted regularly to test the effectiveness of the Plan and evaluations of the Plan are completed and reviewed.  Sprinkler systems and fire extinguishers are installed throughout the facility and are inspected and maintained as required.\n\nThe appropriate level of PPE is maintained on site as required and all affected personnel are trained for PSM awareness, emergency response measures, and mechanical integrity program elements.\n\nThe operation staff consists of the Maintenance Manager, Maintenance Supervisors, and Maintenance Mechanics (operators).  Staff is responsible for the operation and some maintenance of the refrigeration systems, as well as the daily monitoring.  Some maintenance activities are contracted to a qualified refrigeration contractor.\n\nThere is a trained maintenance crew on site during all hours of operation, but the ammonia refrigeration system will not be manned 24 hours.  The system is controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller and compressor microprocessors, which provide an advanced and reliable level of automated operation.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program and OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.
