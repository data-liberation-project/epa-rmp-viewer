      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Regional Water Treatment Plant is located in Wylie, Texas, at 505 E. Brown Street.  The facility is owned and operated by the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD).  This facility is a conventional water treatment plant and uses anhydrous ammonia and chlorine as part of the treatment process.  Currently, a maximum of 88,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and 1,080,000 pounds of chlorine are maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68 are stored or utilized at the facility at thresh-hold levels.  \n\nSafety Policies\nNTMWD is fully committed to safety at the Regional Water Treatment Plant and has long emphasized the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances.  NTMWD has used the 40 CFR 68 requirements as an opportunity to further refine its safety program and strengthen its emergency response procedures.  NTMWD is developing the capability to respond to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or chlorine, should a release occur. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nNTMWD's commitment to managing risks associated with anhydrous ammonia and chlorine is demonstrated by its excellent track record with these substances.  The Regional Water Treatment Plant has not experienced an accident related to anhydrous ammonia or chlorine within the past five years. \n\nSections 4 and 5 do not apply to this facility.\n\nProgram 3 requirements do not apply to this facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nFor the facility's offsite consequence analysis, chlorine was established as having the largest radius of impact, and was thus used for the worst-case scenario.  Public receptors do exist within this radius, including residences, educational facilities, hospitals, parks, major commercial/office buildings, and prisons.  Environmental receptors including state park facilities also exist within the worst-case scenario radius.  As required by the risk management regulations, the offsite consequence analysi"

Realistic potential alternatives were modeled, with consideration toward actual conditions at the site.  The resulting radii of impact are therefore useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\nPrevention Program Description\nThe prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air will be minimized.  This component will be used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program will also become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel. \n\nThe Program 2 Prevention Program includes seven primary components:\n\n7 Safety Information: Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment. Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n7 Hazard Review: Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard review are being resolved in a timely manner.  \n\n7 Operating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures will also be updated should a major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances occur.\n\n7 Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\n\n7 Maintenance:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Inspection"

      "SummaryText": "and testing of regulated process equipment is a requirement as well.\n\n7 Compliance Audits: The prevention program will be audited at least once every three years to evaluate compliance with the risk management rules.  The results of the audit will be documented, and deficiencies corrected.\n\n7 Incident Investigation: Should an incident involving a release, or near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety of the process.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nNTMWD has determined that the Regional Water Treatment Plant will assume a responder status with respect to accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or chlorine.  NTMWD has developed its own emergency response plan and will develop emergency response capabilities, essentially to ensure its ability to act as a first responder in the event of a release.  The plan also calls for close coordination with area fire departments and other emergency response personnel.  \n \nThe facility's employees also have a significant role in the event of a release of anhydrous ammonia or chlorine.  Should a release occur or be suspected when employees are at the facility, employees responsible for working with anhydrous ammonia and chlorine will follow procedures for assessing the situation and attempting to safely stop the release using normal shutdown procedures.  Facility personnel will receive ongoing training in identification of potential releases, and in how to determine when NTMWD emergency response personnel should be involved.\n\nNTMWD will work closely with community emergency response personnel to ensure that emergency response, should it become necessary, is efficiently and safely carried out.  Coordination may include:\n\n7 periodic meetings between operators, NTMWD emergency response personnel, and area fire department emergency responders to discuss emergency response measures\n\n7 periodic review of the facility by NT"

Active mitigation, including scrubbers, is also being considered.  NTMWD will continue to improve its risk management program for the water treatment plant by responding to the recommended changes outlined in the Hazard Review, by ongoing training of personnel, and by continued coordination with emergency response officials.  As the water treatment plant grows to meet the growing demands of the area served by the facility, future plant expansions will consider further improvements in the treatment process to manage risks associated with these regulated substances."
