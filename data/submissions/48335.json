      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nAt the Foamex Plant #3 in Morristown TN, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance.  Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees ant the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency reponse employees within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce molded polyurethane foam and sold mainly to our automotive customers.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by tank truck and is stored in two indoor storage tanks that are surrounded with a secondary containment wall.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored is 160,000 lbs. The TDI is piped to metering units where it is mixed with other reactants to produce molded polyurethane foam parts.\n\nTDI is the only substance handled at our plant that is regulated by EPA's risk management program (RMP) rule.  TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceeds EPA's threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenari"

      "SummaryText": "os\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis (OCA) consists of evaluating worst case release scenarios (WRS's) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs).  We do not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like ours.  ARSs help us to work with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of a accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.\n\nMost people at the endpoint distance of a TDI release would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are likely.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the released substance could be incapacitated\n\nWorst case release scenarios.  Rupture of a TDI storage tank, having a content of 80,000 pounds of TDI would be worst case release of a toxic substance because the TDI storage tank is the largest single container at the plant.  The TDI is stored at a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The pool area is limited by the dike dimensions to 630 square feet.  Redefined dispersion techniques predict a distance of 39 feet from the storage tank to the TDI toxic endpoint concentration of 0.98 ppm (0.007mg/l).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 1 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 1 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI does not impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM), (3) The process "

Our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n\nRelease detection:\n-Process Alarms\n-Operator Surveillance Activities\n\nRelease Containment/Control:\n-Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\n-TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n-Automated shutdown systems for critical process parameters(e.g. high level, high pressure)\n-Pressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\n-Remote shutdown of unloading and transfer pumps\n-Seal-less TDI pumps.\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process\n-Vapor from storage tank is hosed to the unloading vessel\n\nRelease Mitigation:\n-Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n-Trained emergency response personnel\n-Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, breathing air stations)\n\nTen-year accident history:\nWe have had no releases of TDI in the last 10 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.

      "SummaryText": "nd fire prevention plan regulation, OSHA's hazardous wasted and emergency operations regulation, and EPA's emergency response program requirements in its RMP rule.  Our program consists of procedures for responding to a release of TDI.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after and evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs,, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary, based on modification made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and or trained on those changes. The plant also conducts periodic emergency drills."
