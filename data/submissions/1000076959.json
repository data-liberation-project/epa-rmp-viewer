Headquartered in Salisbury, Maryland, the family-owned, privately held company has operations in 15 states. Fifteen processing facilities produce about 56 million pounds of poultry products each week. Perdue also has grain storage and merchandising operations and is ranked among the top 12 largest US grain companies. In addition, Perdue manufactures edible oils, specialty feeds, and livestock feed ingredients and premium pet food ingredients.\r\n\r\nThe Perdue Farms Bridgewater facility is located in Rockingham County, Virginia, in the town of Bridgewater. The facility is a further poultry  processing plant which employs approximately 526 associates to receive chicken and turkey meat plus other raw ingredients to form, prepare and\r\npackage for distribution to the market place. The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance at the Bridgewater facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717). The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures. The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 127,650 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.  The facility maintains a full-time refrigeration maintenance staff that conducts multiple service inspections on a daily basis. In addition, there is a computer control system that monitors temperatures, pressures, and the atmosphere for leaks. Any leaks will result in the activation of an automated radio system to contact refrigeration personnel.\r\n\r\nACCIDE"
