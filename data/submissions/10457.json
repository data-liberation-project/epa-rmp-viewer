Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.\n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility produces maleic anhydride by the oxidation of butane and air in the presence of a catalyst.  Butane is the single regulated substance handled above the regulatory threshold quantity.  Butane is received as a raw material in bulk tank trucks at the truck unloading pad and pumped via flexible hoses into two storage tanks.  Butane is brought to the facility by rail in the event of weather conditions that would not allow delivery by truck.   \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations req"

This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  The USEPA also requires the worst-case scenario for butane to be a vapor cloud explosion of the released material.  Vapor cloud explosions are extremely rare events, even when large quantities of flammable materials are released.   Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case scenario release of butane could potentially affect offsite public receptors.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, an effective mechanical integrity program, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.\n\nAshland also maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in the event of an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history. \n\nThis facility has never had an incident involving butane that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.  There have been no significant releases of butane at our facility within the past five years.  \n\nThe emergency response program. \n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond to accidental chemical releases.
