Executive Summary (40 CFR 68.155)\n\nThe Executive Summary is a brief description of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  J-W Gathering Company will submit the Executive Summary to a central point as specified by the Environmental Protection Agency. \n\n    1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (40 CFR             68.155(a)) \n\nJ-W Gathering Company?s accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  J-W Gathering Company?s emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and complies with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nJ-W Gathering Company?s spill policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n    1.2 Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled (40 CFR 68.155(b))\n\nThe primary activity at J-W Gathering Company?s Moffat Processing Plant, herein referenced as the stationary source and the Facility, is the handling and storage of natural gas liquids (NGL).  As part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are stored on site, and sold to a petroleum refiner.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is Natural Gas Liquid (NGL) that is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include ethane, propane, isobutene, N-butane, isopentane and N-pentane.  These regulated flammable chemicals have a"

      "SummaryText": " regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The maximum inventory of NGL is one 30,000-gallon bulk storage tanks, which contains a maximum of 156,333 lbs. of regulated flammable chemicals.\n\n    1.3 Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario (40 CFR 68.155)) \n\nMethodology given in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance by the EPA was applied using the RMP-COMP model approach to perform worst-case release scenario (WCRS).\n\nThe WCRS submitted for Program 1 flammable substances assumed the release was the total quantity of the 30,000-gallon bulk storage tank which forms a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits, and the cloud detonates.  For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions. \n\nUsing the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure the distance to the endpoint indicated that the Facility has no offsite consequences from the WCRS.  \n\n    1.4 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific             Prevention Steps (40 CFR 68.155(d))\n\nThis facility is a program 1 RMP so none of this is required under 40 CFR 68. \n\n    1.5. Five-year Accident History (40 CFR 68.155(e))\n\nThe Facility has never had a reportable accident of covered processes.  The facility is new, and has not yet begun operation\n\n    1.6 Emergency Response Program (40 CFR 68.155(f))\n\nThe Facility has an Emergency Response Program.  The Emergency Response Plan describes response procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment in the event of a regulated substance accidental release.  Aspects of emergency response include adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notifications of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident cleanup of affected areas. In the event of a covered process accident, first aid procedures and procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n    1.7 Plan"
