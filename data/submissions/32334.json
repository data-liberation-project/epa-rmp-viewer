Compliance with Wisconsin ILHR 32.293 and EPA's \"Risk Management Program Rule\" helps to prevent the release of chlorine and sulfur dioxide from these proceses. Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the event that they do occur, and outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\n\nThe Fox River Water Pollution Control Center is located at 21225 Enterprise Avenue, Brookfield, Wisconsin 53045. The facility has several distinct processes that treat wastewater prior to discharge to the Fox River. Two of those processes, the chlorination process and the dechlorination process, utilize chemicals regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program Rule: chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The chlorination process adds chlorine gas to the wastewater to reduce fecal coliform bacteria. The dechlorination process adds sulfur dioxide to the wastewater to remove excess chlorine prior to discharge to the Fox River, thereby protecting aquatic life in the river. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received in ton cylinder containers. The chlorination and dechlorination processes each have there own storage and process areas. These processes have been disigned in accordance with all local, state and federal codes. Each process has multiple gas detection / warning systems, providing an alarm should the concentration of chlorine or sulfur dioxide exceed one part per million. The chlorination and dechlorination processes are operated and maintained by plant personnel certified by the State of Wisconsin as Wastewater Treatment Plant Operators.\n\nThe Fox River Water Pollution Control Center emergency response program is based upon the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans. The plan is coodinated with the City of Brookf"
