The Facility Policy\n\n\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Hamilton are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Hamilton Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.
