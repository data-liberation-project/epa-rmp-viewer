(GE Quartz) to minimize the potential impact from our facility on our workers, our community neighbors, or the environment. It is the stated policy of GE Quartz to safely manage our site operations. In addition, we have prepared contingency plans to be used in the unlikely event that a major accident should occur.\n\nWe believe it is important for all interested parties to have access to information that can help better understand our business and our facility.  If you have any questions about this document, or any other aspect of our company or our plans, please contact our Community Relations Representative at (216) 266-4121.\n\n\n0.2 \tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOur company is committed to operating safe and environmentally sound manufacturing facilities everywhere we do business. Protection of our neighbors and workers is the highest priority.  The ongoing commitment to worker and public safety is demonstrated through resources invested for safe design, operation and maintenance of our facilities.\n\nIn order to provide top quality products for our customers, the GE Quartz Willoughby Plant (EPA ID Number 1000 0011 0293) uses in its manufacturing process a chemical, hydrofluoric acid (HF), that is classified as toxic.  We are committed to complying with governing laws, regulations, and engineering standards as well as systematic assessments to manage and maintain a safe operation when using this chemical.  Our operating practices and procedures ensure that numerous controls are implemented to prevent an accidental release of a chemical.  However, under the unlikely event that a major release would occur, we immediately notify the local Emergency Response Team of the Fire Department.\n\n\n0.3 \tDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe GE Quartz facility located at 4901 Campbell Road in Willoughby, Ohio, produces quartz crucib"

      "SummaryText": "les and quartz tubes for use in commercial applications such as semi-conductor equipment. Silica sand is used to produce these products. The sand must be properly prepared in order to get the quality desired in the final product.  Aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used as part of the preparation steps to remove contaminants from the silica sand raw material. Water, HF acid, hydrochloric acid, and silica sand are loaded into a \u00bftumbler\u00bf where the mixture is rotated as a batch for a specified period of time. After the washing process, the washed sand, an acid byproduct and spent acid are removed from the tumbler for final treatment.  \n\nThe HF is received by a delivery tanker truck and is transferred to one of two storage tanks that are under roof and surrounded by a containment dike. Truck off-loading takes place on a depressed ramp that also acts as a containment system. When needed, HF flows from the storage tank through hard pipe to the tumbler area. Interlocks and administrative controls require the operator to add water to the tumbler before acid can be added. Therefore, the acid is diluted as it is added to the tumbler. All other processes at the GE Quartz facility involve dilute HF, and are not covered by this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n0.4\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM/CHEMICAL \nSPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nGE Quartz has a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of highly hazardous chemicals at its Willoughby Plant.  This prevention program is an integral part of working safety at GE Quartz.  The prevention program ensures that proper safety information is in place; operating procedures are followed; chemical hazards are identified; employees and contractors are trained; and critical equipment is properly inspected and maintained.  Our prevention program meets all aspects of the accidental release prevention program requirements of the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program.\n\nSpecific safety features at the GE Quartz facility include:\n\n-Comprehe"
