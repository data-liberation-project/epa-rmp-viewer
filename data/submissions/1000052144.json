The following information summarizes this offsite\r\nconsequence analysis.\r\n\r\n1.3.1     Aqueous Ammonia\r\n\r\nAqueous Ammonia is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor.\r\nIt is non-flammable, mixes with water and contact should be\r\navoided with the liquid vapor.  The worst case release\r\nscenario for the toxic substances is failure of the 15,000\r\ngallon (32,190 lbs) aqueous ammonia (29% wt) storage tank in\r\nthe rail car unloading area.  A diked area contains the\r\nrelease aqueous ammonia, which evaporates, forming a vapor\r\ncloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint\r\nconcentration is .30 mile.
