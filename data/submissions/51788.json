      "SummaryText": "Fort Meade is a Department of the Army facility, located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, whose primary mission is to provide housing, training, and operations and maintenance activities in support of the organizations from all four services and numerous Federal agencies.  The most notable tenant is the National Security Agency, which employs the vast majority of the civilian workers at the installation.\n\nThe purpose of this report is to add sulfur dioxide to the existing Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nFort Meade?s Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located just outside the main post, on State Road 198.  The plant uses sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in one-ton containers.  During a compliance audit in 2005, it was discovered that the amount of sulfur dioxide stored at the WWTP exceeds the minimum threshold levels of the chemical accident prevention provisions of the Clean Air Act.  Fort Meade?s options for compliance were to decrease in sulfur dioxide stored on-site, upgrading the existing treatment technology to a ultra-violet treatment method, or adding sulfur dioxide to the current RMP for chlorine.  There was also the possibility that the water utilities at Fort Meade would be privatized in 2007.  Due to various funding and safety concerns, it was determined that the best plan was to add sulfur dioxide to the current RMP.\n\nThe prevention program for the sulfur dioxide process consists of engineering and administrative controls.  Within the storage area, there are sensors to detect releases of sulfur dioxide.  The storage area is closed to the outdoor environment.  The sensors and alarms are tested once a month to ensure that they are in proper working order.  In the event of a release, the Fort Meade Fire Department would be the first responders.  A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on 3 Oct 2007 which included what-if scenarios that would result in a release.  The PHA revealed no safety issues that needed to be addre"

Monitors and meters are tested by the Fire Department every month and the protective suits are inspected every six months."
