The primary purpose of this facility is to further process meat and food products for distribution to retailers.  Construction of this plant was completed in the fall of 2009.  We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia is contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping and vessels in our facility.  Ammonia as contained in equipment in the facility is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.  We believe that ammonia provides the safest and most efficient cooling choice for our operation. \r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal, State, and local laws, statutes, codes, rules, and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\r\n\r\nA. Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies \r\n\r\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since 2009 under the PSM standard. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State and local codes.  This food processing facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State and local codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system. These precautions include safety contr"

The prevention program consists of the following elements: \r\n\r\n\u00bf Employee Participation Program: \r\nThe Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.   \r\n\u00bf Process Safety Information: \r\nAmmonia refrigeration equipment manuals and plant design technical specifications including piping diagrams are on file.  \r\n\u00bf Process Hazard Analysis: \r\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) re-validation was conducted in June 2014 and another PHA re-validation is schedule for June 2019.   A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.
