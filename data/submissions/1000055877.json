These programs provide for the implementation of detailed\n\nprevention and response procedures when storing and handling hazardous chemicals. The program objectives are to ensure worker and public safety and to provide environmental protection.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only substance at the facility that is regulated under the PSM and RMP\n\nprograms. This is the same type of ammonia commonly sprayed on fields by farmers to fertilize crops.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant throughout the plant to maintain desired product\n\ntemperatures in coolers, freezers and working areas. Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility. This refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequences of analysis was determined utilizing RMP comp and the population data is\n\nbased upon information pulled from Marplot on 02/22/2016. How to determine the WCS & ARS was\n\nderived from the EPA document, Risk Management Program guidance for offsite consequences of\n\nanalysis (1999).\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the\n\nsystem, included are: high and low level automated shutdown systems and high and low pressure automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur.\n\n\n\nThis facilities emergency response program is an action plan to respond to and resolve incidents\n\nAssociated with the ammonia refrigeration system. The Fire Department / Hazmat Team will be notified so that they can provide assistance during an incident. If it is necessary to con"
