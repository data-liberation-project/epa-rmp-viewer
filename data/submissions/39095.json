      "SummaryText": "The Centralia Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment facility located on the north side of Centralia, IL at 2219 Old 51 Road.  The facility is owned by the City of Centralia and is operated by a total of nine (9) operators.  The Risk Management Plan implementation will be the responsibility of the Water Superintendent.  The Centralia Water Treatment Plant uses various chemicals including chlorine to treat raw water in order to provide safe drinking water for the City of Centralia and surrounding communities.  Chlorine is the only regulated substance handled or stored at the Water Treatment Plant which is over the RMP threshhold limit.  The maximum amount of chlorine kept on-site at this facility is 10,000 pounds.\n\nChemical safety is a concern of the Centralia Water Treatment Plant.  Operators at this facility are skilled in the handling of hazardous chemicals and are aware of the consequences of an accidental release.  The facility has coordinated with the Centralia Fire Department to implement an Emergency Response Plan.  In the event of an accidental release of chlorine, Freeman Environmental Services will handle the repair of the leak.  The Centralia Fire Department has the repair kits for 1-ton chlorine containers in their possession and will provide them to the repair team when needed.\n\nThe Centralia Water Treatment Plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine within the past 10 years.  This lack of accidental releases is probably due to the fact that skilled operators complete an on-going inspection of the chlorination process and maintenance is performed on a regular as-needed basis.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program for the Centralia Water Treatment Plant includes daily inspections of systems in the plant including the complete chlorination system.  This on-going inspection conducted by skilled operators results in the maintenace of the chlorination system being performed on an as-needed basis.  These inspections and maintenance operation"

      "SummaryText": "s help to prevent the risk of accidental release due to equipment failure.  The facility is equipped with two chlorine leak detectors, one located in the chlorine feed room and one located in the chlorine storage area.  These sensors trigger an audible and visible alarm within the facility when a chlorine leak is detected.  The operators are trained in the use of SCBA's and use this equipment and work in teams when changing chlorine containers.  The City has recently installed separate load cell scales and LED readouts for the on-line and standby chlorine cylinders.  These improvements to the Chlorination system help to predict and diagnose chlorine gas regulator problems.\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan developed for the Centralia Water Treatment Plant has been coordinated with local emergency responders.  The plan is designed to effectively and adequately respond to a chlorine release in order to minimize injuries and damage to the facility and surrounding community.  The plan is also used to provide guidance to offsite responders such as the Centralia Fire and Police Departments.  The plan includes steps to be taken in the event of an accidental release and responsibility of Water Treatment Plant Operators and emergency responders.  The Centralia Fire Department has the responsibility of contacting the repair team and have the necessary repair kits in their possession.  The plan also contains procedures for shelter or evacuation of affected residences and other public receptors.  Also included in the Emergency Response Plan are training and release drill procedures.\n\nIn conclusion, the Centralia Water Treatment Plant is committed to the safe handling of chlorine in order to provide the City of Centralia and surrounding communities with safe drinking water as well as reducing the risk of an accidental release.  However, in the event of an accidental release, the Centralia Water Treatment Plant has developed an Emergency Response Plan designed to lessen the impact of "
