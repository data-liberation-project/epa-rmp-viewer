Bonanza has evacuation and response procedures for fires, explosions, spills, etc. outlined in the facility Emergency Action Plan. The Plans listed as part of this Executive Summary have been prepared in accordance with the applicable regulations, as necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nBonanza provides safety training to its employees and contractors on an annual basis.

The endpoint used was an overpressurization of 1.0 pound per square inch (psi), a worst-case option. Denaturant deliveries at the facility typically occur during normal business hours with a facility staff member overseeing loadout operations \u2013 therefore a release at the loadout area could be ceased within minutes by manual overrides. The loadout area also has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment of the tank farm. For this scenario, passive and active mitigation was not considered, as the mitigation strategies currently in place would not contain a vapor cloud fire. RMP Comp was used to determine the alternate distance to endpoint (<0.1 miles); the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth as well as the facility\u2019s knowledge of nearby residences. No environmental receptors would be affected by an alternate release of denaturant. \n\nBonanza qualifies as a Program 3 facility due to the presence of the flammable mixture that is covered by the Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nPlease review the first section of this Executive Summary for the general accidental release prevention program information.\n\nBonanza\u2019s maintenance department performs regular preventative maintenance inspections, as required by the manufacturer's recommendations and/or State and Federal regulations. Monthly visual inspections are conducted and monthly leak detection monitoring is performed, with associated reports file"

The facility operates 24 hours per day, seven (7) days per week to manufacture fuel-grade or industrial ethanol from corn. The regulated substance under the RMP program is a flammable mixture - natural gasoline (denaturant).\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\nWorst Case Scenarios:\n\n1.\tNFPA 4 Flammable Mixture (Denaturant): The flammable mixture stored onsite is natural gasoline, typically referred to as denaturant. Natural gasoline is used onsite to denature ethanol prior to shipment off-site.  Denaturant is stored in a nominal 165,000-gallon aboveground steel tank in the facility tank farm. The tank is located within a diked containment structure that contains an impermeable liner with gravel overlay. The facility\u2019s natural gasoline (denaturant) SDS was used to determine RMP applicability. The breakdown of reportable constituents is included as part of the determination documentation. The worst-case scenario used is the release of the entire contents of the denaturant tank, 1,121,522 pounds, causing a vapor cloud explosion. RMP Comp was used to determine the worst-case distance to endpoint (0.8 miles); the model results are provided as part of this documentation. Population data was obtained using Circular Area Profiling Software (CAPS) which incorporates 2020 U.S. Census Data. Public receptor information (i.e., schools, hospitals, etc.) was obtained using Google Earth and Bing Maps, as well as the facility\u2019s knowledge of nearby residences. A ditch is located to the east of the facility. This ditch flows southeast toward the Garden City Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is located within the worst-case distance to endpoint for denaturant. The water will eventually reach the Arkansas River, which is also within the worst-case distance to end"

The anniversary date of the most recent resubmission of the RMP was November 2, 2017, and this resubmission is being submitted to update information related to activities at the plant since the last resubmission. The last resubmission was to provide information regarding changes for RMP-covered processes at the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES:\nBonanza has an ongoing commitment to the health and safety of onsite employees and the surrounding community. This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training for the proper operation and maintenance of plant equipment and preventative maintenance programs.\n\nBonanza has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan; Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan; Facility Response Plan; Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan; and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans require a minimum of annual training in order to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility. New employees are required to undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\nBonanza\u2019s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator and their work and 24-hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The EH&S Manager is also listed, with their associated work and 24-hour emergency response telephon"
