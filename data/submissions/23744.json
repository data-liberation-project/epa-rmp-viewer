DSM considers proper SHE management to be a \nfundamental part of its operations. We have incorporated the main SHE elements in a management \nsystem that is closely linked to the Responsible Care program and is at the same time based on the ISO \n9000 and ISO 14000 standards. DSM's SHE policy clearly states what the company understands by safe, \nhealthy and environmentally conscious working. Our policy objectives are:\n?\tan accident-free working environment. DSM is convinced that all accidents can be prevented.\n?\tno occupational diseases or health problems attributable to DSM's activities.\n?\tongoing evaluation and improvement of working methods, processes, products and services to \nensure that these are safe and acceptable from the point of view of employees, customers, the \ncommunity and the environment.\nIn order to achieve these objectives we have laid down a number of principles that apply throughout the \nDSM organization:\n?\tSHE management is just as important as production, marketing, profitability and product quality.\n?\tAll our sites are subject to the same SHE standards.\n?\tEach site has its own SHE management system.\n?\tEach site is subject to regular audits.\n?\tEach site reports on its SHE performance.\n?\tEach site actively communicates with the neighboring community.\nW"

      "SummaryText": "HO IS DSM Chemicals North America, Inc.?\nThe DSM facility in Augusta was originally a joint venture between DSM of The Netherlands and PPG \nIndustries of Pittsburgh, PA. Founded in 1962, the joint venture's first production facility was a nitrogen \nfertilizer complex. In 1964, Nipro, Inc., (the predecessor of today's DSM Chemicals) was organized to \nmanufacture caprolactam, a monomer of nylon used in nylon fiber production. Subsequent expansions of \nDSM Chemicals resulted in two additional caprolactam plants in Augusta, in 1974 and 1976, which made \nDSM Chemicals the largest independent supplier of caprolactam in the U.S.  In 1999 nylon 6 production  \nbegan at the DSM Augusta site. In late 1999, a carpet recycle facility began recovering the original pure \ncaprolactam from waste carpet and nylon scrap.\nWHAT DOES DSM Chemicals MEAN TO AUGUSTA? TO GEORGIA?\nThe DSM Chemicals plant facilities and sales offices in Augusta mean jobs for approximately 376 \ncompany employees and 250 contract employees. In terms of dollars, DSM Chemicals means annual \ndomestic sales in excess of $108,000,000, export sales of over $75,000,000 and an annual payroll of \nover $25,000,000.\nWhat is Caprolactam?\nCaprolactam is the primary raw material used in the production of nylon 6. At DSM's Augusta plant \ncaprolactam is stored in heated tanks in the liquid state at a temperature of 170? F.  Molten caprolactam \nis shipped to domestic customers, who convert it to nylon 6 for end uses including carpet, tire cord, \nmonofilament (weed eater line and fishing line), engineered plastics, and apparel.  DSM also converts \ncaprolactam to a solid state flake.  The flake is then packaged for export sales mainly for textile \napplications (apparel and hosiery).\n\n\n\n\nOleum\nBasic Information\n?\tOleum, also known as fuming sulfuric acid, is basically a clear liquid with a slight milky-gray tint and a \nseverely irritating odor. Exposure to the liquid causes tissue destruction. Oleum is a severe fume \nhazard. The fu"

At DSM it is used to convert our intermediate product to our final product, caprolactam. After \nit is neutralized with ammonia, the oleum is in turn converted to ammonium sulfate, a by-product \nfertilizer.\nWorst Case  Release Scenario\n?\tA full 279,000 gallon tank of 24% oleum fails catastrophically. 4,490,000 pounds of oleum are \nreleased instantaneously.

The release \ncontinues for 10 minutes before it is discovered and the flow is stopped. 43,000 pounds of oleum are \nreleased. \n?\tEPA look-up tables predict the fumes will travel 0.47 mile before the fume concentration in air will fall \nto 3 ppm, which is considered a safe level.  \n\nFive Year Accidental Release History \nThere was one spill of oleum during the last five years.
