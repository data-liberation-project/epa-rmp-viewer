      "SummaryText": "The chlorine in service is enclosed in a ten foot by fifteen foot brick room built within a larger chemical feed room located on the second floor of a three-floor water treatment facility.  The third floor is used for chemical storage and hopper fill.  The chlorine room is entered through a door that is kept closed at all times while not in use and has a glass window for viewing into and out of the chlorine room.  It also has a vent built into it near the bottom of the door.  The door has a large \"CAUTION\" sign with skull and crossbones permanently secured as well as a regular size poison gas label.  Posted on the outside wall, next to the door is a large poster explaining the operating instructions for the vacuum system located inside the chlorine room.  The remote vacuum system preventive maintenance schedule is on a two-year cycle.  The exhaust fan on/off switch is located on the wall next to the door.  It remains in the on position at all times.  The exhaust fanvents are situated twelve inches off the floor and exhaust out  the top of the building.   Policy dictates that two Operators work together to change the chlorine banks.  Chlorine cylinders, which weigh 150 lbs. each, are off-loaded from the truck on the loading dock.  They are then moved with a properly balanced hand truck with clamp supports that fasten about two-thirds of the way up the cylinder into an elevator that delivers the chlorine to the second floor.  The chlorine cylinders are then wheeled to the outside adjacent wall of the chlorine room where they are secured to the wall in an upright position with chain until they are put into service.  Once again, the outside wall of the chlorine room is inside the chemical feed room; away from any direct heat from steam pipes or radiators and direct sunlight.  When cylinders are moved without the hand truck, they are rolled in a vertical position, never lifted, pushed, or dropped.  The operator checks chlorine equipment on an hourly basis; service person"

      "SummaryText": "nel on a monthly basis inspect chlorine equipment.  The normal amount of Chlorine in possession at the water treatment plant is 1800 lbs., during summer months, chlorine is stored at the plant for use in the city swimming pool.  The total amount stored in the plant during this time is 3000 lbs.  That translates into 20 cylinders, of which 16 are in storage chained against the wall, and 4 in service.  The chlorine cylinders arrive with protective caps, which remain in place until the chlorine is put into service.  A fusible plug is placed in the valve below the valve seat prior to the shipment from the chemical company.  This plug is a safety device.  It prevents the buildup of excessive pressures and the possibility of rupture due to fire or high surrounding temperatures.  Cylinders do not explode under normal conditions.  The City of Parsons Water Treatment Plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine gas occurring during the previous five years.  There is no record of such an occurrence in the history of the plant.  The worst case release scenario would occur if all four of the cylinders in service were full and should simultaneously release the gas.  We estimate that a release rate of thirty-three pounds per minute for a period of ten minutes is accurate.  If the wind speed were 1.5 meters per second, the distance the gas travels is one-half mile.  We estimate there to be one hundred people within that distance.  The alternate case release scenario would occur if a pipe leaked.  We estimate that a release rate of one pound per minute for a period of fifteen minutes is accurate.  If the wind speed were three meters per second, the distance the gas travels is one tenth of a mile.  We estimate that approximately 100 people could be in the danger zone.  In these scenarios, all plant personnel would put on an oxygen mask, call the fire department, and leave the area.  The written community response plan would be activated.  The Police and Fire Departments would"
