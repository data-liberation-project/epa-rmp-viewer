Bulk and packaged products are received via transport trucks or rail cars, depending on the location, and stored for the eventual sale to farmers.  This facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors due to the RMP covered process.  There have been no accidents in the past five years.  The facility's safety record is a direct result of the emphasis placed on safety by management and employees alike.\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program\nThis facility strives to meet or exceed compliance with all regulations.  The company's Environmental, Health & Safety staff provides technical assistance and performs safety and environmental audits on a regular basis.  Training is provided for each new hire and re-hire employee and also on a monthly basis in the form of a monthly safety meeting.  In addition to safety training, employees may be certified in First Aid and CPR.  Tank(s) and associated equipment are inspected annually following recommended industry and engineering frequencies.  Royster-Clark believes safety and environmental stewardship must be second nature to all employees and contractor personnel.\n\nC.  Emergency Response Policies and Program\nEach employee is trained to be familiar with the emergency response policies and procedures through safety reviews and other safety meetings.  This facility has an Emergency Plan which covers accidental releases, natural disasters, security incidents and other emergency response practices and procedures.  The Emergency Plan for this facility is reviewed and updated on an annual basis as part of a comprehensive review process.  The procedures provided in the Emergency Plan are shared with all employees and followed in the event of an emergency.  Employees are provided refresher training on emergency response on an annual basis.  The local emer"

Worst-case Scenario\nBased on the worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA, there would be public receptors within the affected zone for this facility.  The EPA requires a very conservative worst-case scenario to be a catastrophic rupture of the largest stationary tank with a complete loss of product. \n\nIt should be noted EPA describes the worst-case scenario as:  Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative\u00bfThese endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one half hour to one hour without any serious health effects.  In addition, the worst-case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.
