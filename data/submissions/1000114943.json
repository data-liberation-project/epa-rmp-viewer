The plan documents all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is updated as necessary to reflect any pertinent changes within the processes at the facility that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe facility works with the Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPA) with which the facility emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\nEmergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced in order to ensure that it is functioning properly at all times.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nHayward is improving safety by implementing the Prevent. Protect. Respond. (PPR) campaign. PPR focuses on strengthening operational discipline, the identification and mitigation of hazards, and executing appropriate action in response to unplanned events. We are focusing on our procedure use culture to ensure that it remains a strong foundation for process safety. We are identifying and executing strategic projects to strengthen our engineering controls to prevent process safety incidents. The Hayward Site partners with the local fire departments, including hosting hazardous material response drills for firefighters in the San Francisco Bay Area."

Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Hayward site promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a serious release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root causes leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Hayward site operates on the premise that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues, to attend applicable reviews, and to recommend improvements.  Improvements are solicited and implemented as appropriate.  In addition, employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Hayward site hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  The facility has a strict program for informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes, as well as the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform the facility of any hazards they may introduce or encounter while at the site.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe Hayward site had one accidental release of acrylonitrile in the past 5 years. The release was 0.47 pounds. One employee received medical treatment at an offsite facility as a result of the release. The investigation is in progress, and preliminary information from the investigation is reported in S6. Five-Year Acciden"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Hayward site has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Hayward site carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel receive specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at the Hayward site to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and receive training on the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications of existing processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Hayward Site.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating & maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup, and that all necessary personnel have been trained prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Hayward site conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule and other applicable regulatory requirements are being followed and have been implemented properly.  Audits are conduc"

The facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 19 CFR 1910.119. The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Hayward Site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Hayward site maintains detailed records of safety information that, among other things, describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with all covered processes.  Numerous types of information are available to supplement safety information, including Safety Data Sheets for materials used on site, equipment and engineering design specifications and applicable reactive chemicals testing.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Hayward site conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis are conducted.  This methodology is supplemented when needed with analyses that may include What if Analysis, Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis, and Safer Technology and Alternative Analysis (STAA).  A team of qualified personnel perform the studies along with experts in engineering and process operations.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, the Hayward site maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaroun"

This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the CUPA and City of Hayward Fire Department which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company Hayward site operates under one air permit. \nIn 2019, Rohm and Haas Chemicals, LLC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow, Inc. rather than The Dow Chemical Company. The Hayward facility will be referenced in this updated RMP plan as the Dow, Inc., Hayward Rohm and Haas Facility.\nThe Hayward Facility is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility that produces a variety of non-hazardous water-based polymeric emulsions. This activity is described by SIC code 2821 and NAICS code 325211. Approximately sixty different products are manufactured at the plant using different mixtures of reactants.\n\nThe regulated substances are Acrylonitrile and Ammonia (conc 20% or greater).  \n\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection\n\nWhere worst and alternate case scenarios impacted additional receptors, all scenarios were included in the submittal."
