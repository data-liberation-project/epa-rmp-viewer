Empire Kosher Poultry is located at 247 Empire Drive in Mifflintown, PA and has prepared this written document in an effort plan for emergencies relating to the anhydrous ammonia.  The facility currently uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant on site a  quantity above the EPA threshold value of ten thousand (10,000) pounds.  As such, this document was also prepared to comply with 40 CFR 68.  The facility also participates in and complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Program from 29 CFR1910.110 which is implemented to also comply with the EPA's requirements under 40 CFR 68 as applicable,\n\nThe Empire Kosher Poultry facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, in its refrigeration process.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by a tanker truck delivery and is transferred into the high-pressure receivers into one (1) of the two (2) systems at the facility.  System 1, referred to as the main system, has a high-pressure receiver located on the southwest corner of the facility and is designed to store a maximum of nineteen thousand (19,000) pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The facility also has one smaller system referred to as the 300-ton system which does not contain quantities of ammonia above the EPA\u0092s threshold planning quantity. The 300-ton system is designed to store a maximum of eight thousand (8,000) pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The two (2) systems were designed, installed, and maintained so that a catastrophic failure of one (1) system will not affect the other system.  As such, only the anhydrous ammonia contained in the main system was considered for the Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario. \n\nThe 150-ton system previously designed to store a maximum of three thousand (3,000) pounds of anhydrous ammon"
