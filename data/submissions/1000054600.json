      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThe Desert View power plant was constructed during 1990-91. It consists of two biomass-fired boilers to supply steam to a single turbine generator producing 47 MW of electric power. Electric power is transmitted directly to the Imperial Irrigation District. Three acutely hazardous materials (AHMs) are utilized on site. Ammonia is required by a permit condition for the purpose of reducing the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the combustor flue gas. Sulfuric acid is used in the cooling water system for the purpose of controlling the acidic level of the water (i.e. for pH control). Sodium Hypochlorite (liquid chlorine bleach) is used to treat the cooling tower water. Each system is briefly described below.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon (9,840 gallon working capacity) ASME code pressure vessel. With 265 psi safety valves to control over pressure in the tank and excess flow valves to control leaks that could be caused by potential breaks in the piping. The ammonia NOx control system operates at a pressure of 50 psig.\n\n\n\nSulfuric acid is stored in one 1,700 gallon polyethylene double walled tank. The sulfuric acid is fed to the cooling tower, and is used to control the pH level of the water.\n\n\n\nSodium Hypochlorite is stored in a 2,500 gallon polyethylene double walled storage tank. Sodium Hypochlorite is used to control bacterial growth in the cooling water. Sodium Hypochlorite is fed to the cooling water system via pumps.\n\n\n\nDuring the RMPP process, a comprehensive analysis was made of all aspects of the facility involving acutely hazardous materials. This included a review of the P&IDs; operational procedures, including start-up, normal operations and emergency shut-down; auditing and inspection program; and the training program. In addition, a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOPS) was conducted on the three systems.\n\n\n\nThe RMPP is published in two volumes. Volume I contains a summary of the results of RMPP while Volume II contains t"

No residences, schools or places of public assemblage lie within the ammonia vapor cloud hazard footprints. The hazard footprints for all the accidents analyzed, except one, are contained within the facility boundaries. The one that does extend off-site does not reach any residences, schools or places of public assemblage.\n\n"
