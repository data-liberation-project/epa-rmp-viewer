      "SummaryText": "1.  INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nFour Rivers Nuclear Partnership, LLC, (FRNP) has updated the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in accordance with requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  The PGDP facility is subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Program requirements. This update to the RMP has been prepared to remove the fluorine processes, because fluorine no longer is present at PGDP in quantities exceeding its threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130. This RMP update also reflects a change in the operator of PGDP from Fluor Federal Services, Inc., to FRNP. Other information in the RMP has been updated as needed.\r\n\r\n2.  MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION \r\n\r\nFRNP's policy is to provide a safe and healthy workplace for all people supporting the project. FRNP is dedicated to the belief that all injuries, accidents, and incidents are preventable and is committed to integrating safety and other operational requirements (e.g., environmental, quality, security) into all aspects of work planning and execution.\r\n \r\n3.  GENERAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\n3.1  Facility Description and Location\r\n\r\nPGDP formerly enriched uranium using the gaseous diffusion process.  PGDP is located at 37.114444 latitude and -88.809167 longitude measured at the approximate center of the plant, on a 3,423-acre tract (and 133 acres in easements) in McCracken County, Kentucky. The site is in a generally rural area and previously was part of Kentucky Ordnance Works.  PGDP occupies approximately 650 acres within the Controlled Access Area. Highway U.S. 60 is the closest major highway and intersects the plant access road 3.5 miles south of the plant. Interstate Highway 24 is to the east of the plant and intersects U.S. 60 near the present city limits of Paducah.  The north, east, and west boundaries of the plant are defined by the West Kentucky Wildlife Management Area.  Adjoining the reserve on the north is the Tennessee Valley A"

      "SummaryText": "uthority's Shawnee Fossil Plant, which is located on the Ohio River. The entire PGDP facility is owned by the DOE.  \r\n\r\nUSEC leased and operated a portion of the PGDP facility for enrichment operations. The leased portion contained the facilities that handled chemicals that required an RMP. USEC ceased enrichment operations and returned the facilities to DOE on October 21, 2014. \r\n\r\n3.2  Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nChlorine is the only substance listed in 40 CFR 68.130 that is present at PGDP in a quantity exceeding its threshold quantity.  Chlorine is managed in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119, PSM program, as well as the Risk Management Program. Fluorine was present at PGDP in a quantity exceeding its threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 68.130 and subject to the RMP until January 30, 2018, when the last fluorine tube truck was shipped off-site.   \r\n\r\n3.3  Use of Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n3.3.1  Chlorine\r\n\r\nRaw water is taken from the Ohio River, treated, and supplied to PGDP for numerous uses.  After the chemical softening process, chlorine is used for primary disinfection of the water supply. A portion of the water then is filtered, post-disinfected using chlorine, and then used to supply potable water, fire system water, cooling water, and for other uses.  Raw water treatment takes place at the C-611 Water Treatment Plant, which is located to the west of the plant.  Chlorine is used at two locations at C-611.  \r\n \r\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no major releases of chlorine involving injury to site workers, environmental effects, or any impact to the public within the past five years.  \r\n\r\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nChemical safety at PGDP consists of the integration of environmental, safety, and health management systems to address chemical safety.  Chemical safety controls are designed to mitigate the adverse effects of the hazardous materials and toxic substances used in the enrichment process to workers, th"

PSM Process Hazards Analyses (PHAs) are used to identify and manage chemical risks and impacts.  Specific job-related risks and the technical and administrative controls used for risk management are addressed in the PHAs. \r\n\r\n5.1  Control Systems\r\n\r\nSeveral passive and active control systems are used to minimize the accidental release of chlorine. All chlorine feed facilities utilize a vacuum feed system. The feed systems are equipped with container-mounted vacuum regulators that reduce the pressure of the chlorine from the vapor pressure of the liquid chlorine in the container.  Loss of vacuum for any reason causes the vacuum-regulating valve to close the gas supply, minimizing the release in the event of a break in the manifold.\r\n\r\nAll chlorine feed facilities are equipped with chlorine detectors, which provide alarms to plant personnel in the event of a release.\r\n\r\nManually operated, remote valve closing rods are administratively required to be in place on the stem of open, 1-ton chlorine container valves.  These valves can be operated from outside of the chlorinator rooms in the event of a release from the manifold system.\r\n\r\n5.2  Procedures\r\n\r\nPlant procedures are prepared in accordance with the requirements of a formal procedure program.  The procedure program includes the development, review and approval, revision process, distribution, and procedure configuration management.  Specific procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine systems and the handling of storage cylinders are managed within the procedure program.\r\n\r\n5.3  Training\r\n\r\nEmployee training is coordinated by a dedicated training organization.
