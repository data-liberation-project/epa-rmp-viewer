The site has mobile foam capabilities to control vapor release.  All emergency response personnel receive ongoing training.  The facility has 24-hour emergency response capabilities and can respond to both on-site and transportation off-site hazardous materials releases.  The facility is also part of the Dow Chemical regional response network and provides offsite response into the community when requested on a mutual aid basis.  Facility emergency response personnel have radio communications with the Bucks County 911 center.  Emergency response personnel can be self dispatched, or dispatched through the County 911 center.  The facility is also able to access the Community Alerting Network (CAN) through the Bristol Township Emergency Management Department.   Plant drill and mutual aid response activities are practiced annually.   \n\n8.0\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nThe  focus on safety is strong throughout the Rohm and Haas Company and The Dow Chemical Company.  Rohm and Haas continuously looks for ways to reduce risks and to improve safety performance.  This includes improvements in control technology, inspections, training, and maintenance of process equipment. Croydon Plant safety program is integrated into all parts of plant operation and involves the identification and implementation of  ways to improve safety performance.   The plant has evaluated its operations against Dow Chemical process safety standards and is changing where necessary to meet these internal standards."

The safety performance of contractors is reviewed on a periodic basis.  Contractors with unacceptable safety performance are not allowed to work onsite.\n\n5.10\tIncident Investigation - Any incidents or near misses involving the release of RMP covered hazardous materials are investigated by a team of skilled and knowledgeable plant personnel.  These investigations identify corrective actions, evaluate our management systems and are documented and communicated as appropriate throughout the company in a narrative report.  Any required corrective actions are tracked for timely completion.\n\n5.11\tCompliance Audits - Audits of our Process Safety Management System and RMP are conducted  every three years by the Dow corporate auditing group.

The Croydon Plant complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, which is nearly identical to EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. Additionally, the Plant follows corporate and plant-specific safety standards, (which in some cases are more stringent than the OSHA general safety standards), while also complying with EPA, DOT, and state requirements.   The following items are part of our ongoing program to prevent releases and incidents for RMP toxic chemicals as well as any other chemicals:  \n\n5.1\t Employee Participation -  Employees are involved in many activities to continuously improve plant safety.   Employees participate in safety committees, audits, design and pre-startup safety reviews, management of change reviews, process hazard analysis, training, procedure development and monthly safety meetings.   Employees make rounds to identify potential leaks or other safety hazards.   Employees use Dow Chemical electronic tools to communicate hazardous conditions to each other and management.\n\n5.2\tProcess Hazard Analysis - A process hazard analysis technique known as RC/PHA (Reactive Chemical/Process Hazard Analysis) is used to identify and analyze the potential hazards associated with the chemicals and processes we use. An additional technique, Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), is also used to analyze potential hazards.   Corrective action plans are developed and implemented as part of the analysis and updated a minimum of every three years.  Safety systems are designed into the processes.

Facilities that manage more than a threshold amount of a listed chemical are subject to the RMP.  Covered facilities must assess the risks associated with their management of the listed chemicals and produce a plan to prevent releases and accidents.  In order to assist in emergency planning, covered facilities must evaluate a worst case and alternative case scenarios that would result from the release of a listed chemical.\n\n**Note- The Worst Case scenario captured within this submission has been updated to account for a more conservative assumption on the containment capabilities of the areas surrounding the acrylonitrile railcar storage.  The Estimated distance to the toxic endpoint and estimated residential population within distance to endpoint have been updated accordingly based upon the more conservative assumption.\n\n4.0\tRegulated Substances\n\nThe Croydon Plant uses one RMP toxic chemical at threshold quantity: \nAcrylonitrile monomer - Storage tank, railcar, and 3 covered reactors\n\n**Note - Vinyl Acetate has been removed from coverage due to the current maximum intended inventory remaining below the threshold of 15,000 pounds.

Our continuing work to prevent accidents and releases from occurring, as well as our preparations to respond to incidents should they occur, help to ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This summary provides an overview of the risk management activities at the Croydon Plant, and a discussion of our response to the EPAs Risk Management Program. \n\n2.0\tGeneral Facility Information\n\nThe Croydon Plant is a specialty chemical manufacturing facility located in Bristol Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  The plant was built in 1969 and is part of a larger site, the Bristol Site, originally built in 1917.  Today, the Bristol Site includes the Croydon plant, the Bristol Polymers production plant, and corporate engineering group.  The Croydon Plant shares many of the services provided at the Bristol Site including a unified emergency response network.  Of the total site area of 800 acres, only 250 acres are in actual use with the balance of the area utilized as open space accommodating a variety of plant and animal species.\n\nThe Croydon Plant produces over 150 different products which are sold to other manufacturers who use them as key components in consumer products.  These products are aqueous based acrylic emulsions which are used as coatings and binders.  Emulsion coating products are used in interior and exterior latex paint and traffic line formulations.  In addition, these products are found in floor polishes, adhesives, inks, cosmetics, coatings and binders for paper products, cement and concrete.  Because the products are water based, they are more environmentally friendly than solvent based coatings.\n\nThe Croydon Plant produces more than 240 million pounds of product annually.  The plant works with the Bristol Sit"
