      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe Lambda Energy Resources Kalkaska Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes. Lambda Energy Resources's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe KGP is a modern cryogenic natural gas treating and processing plant. Hydrocarbons arrive at the KGP via three sources: 1) the DTE/MichCon wet header gathering pipelines, 2) truck offloading, and 3) railcar offloading. The gas and liquids from the DTE/MichCon wet headers are combined in a slug catcher at the Kalkaska Inlet Facility (KIF) where the gas and liquids separate and where measurement and custody transfer occur.\n\n\n\nThe gas exits the top of the KIF to the KGP Amine process for CO2 removal and CO2 Injection. The gas is then dried in the Mol Sieve Dehydration process and then sent to the Cryogenic Unit (Cryo) where the methane (Sales Gas) is separated from the rest of the hydrocarbon components in the Demethanizer. The liquids off of the bottom of the Demethanizer are then separated in the Deethanizer and Depropanizer. The Depropanizer is utilized in a batch process to operate as a Depropanizer, Debutanizer, and lastly as a Butane Splitter. The intermediate products from C3+ to the Splitter Feed are stored until needed as well as the finished products of ethane, propane, isobutane, n-butane, and condensate (C5+ liquids sold as oil). The KIF and ethane storage consists of large diameter piping that is sloped and underground whereas all other product storage is aboveground in pressure-rated bullet tanks. Truck"

      "SummaryText": "s and Railcar hydrocarbon liquids are also offloaded and stored prior to processing into the Deethanizer. The ethane and condensate products are shipped out via pipeline. The propane and butane products are shipped out via LPG truck, rail, or in the past by pipeline, which the pipeline hasn't been used for other than ethane since 4/1/2014. The methane based Sales Gas is shipped out via pipeline to DTE/MichCon for distribution to their customers.\n\n\n\nThose liquids that entered the KIF are sent directly to the condensate stabilizer, where light ends are flashed off and routed upstream of the Amine Plant. The liquids from the Condensate Stabilizer go either to storage as condensate and then shipped out via pipeline or are stored in the Debutanizer Feed Tank for further processing. The stabilized condensate is shipped out via the non-Lambda Energy Resources crude line.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Kalkaska Gas Plant. Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Kalkaska Gas Plant's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\n\n\nThe Kalk"

These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.).\n\n\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in developing and conducting all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs. Accident prevention is  discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary. Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA). The process safety information will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-sta1tup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans. Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\n\n\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).\n\n\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that "

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n \n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.\n\n\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest . risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.

The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the  team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators. Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\n\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities. To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees. Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures. The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Kalkaska Gas Plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work. In addition the Kalkaska Gas Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Review  (PSSR)\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.

The Kalkaska Gas Plant incorporates . quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely .\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant has a com"

      "SummaryText": "prehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\n \n\nCompliance  Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Kalkaska Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Kalkaska Gas Plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are "

The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Kalkaska Gas Plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release,\n\n(2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes.\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n\n\nRelease  Containment/Control\n\n1.    Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2.    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated)\n\n3.    Automated  shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high    temperature, high/low pressure)\n\n4.  Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n5.    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\n\n6.    Atmospheric relief devices\n\n \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.    Fire suppression equipment\n\n2.    Personnel trained in emergency procedures\n\n3.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  Over the past 5 years there have been no accidental releases.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY  PROCEDURE  INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker"

The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to Kalkaska Gas Plant facilities. The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change (MOC) process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Kalkaska Gas Plant is coordinated with the Kalkaska County, Michigan, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Kalkaska Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Kalkaska Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the Kalkaska Gas Plant provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the plant.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant conducts yearly on-going infrared testing of breakers in MCC's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
