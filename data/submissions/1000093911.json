              "Description": "There are two supply sources for the nexAir production of acetylene gas cylinders.  The primary source of acetylene supply is the Praxair bulk acetylene trailers, each with a capacity of 75,000 cubic ft at 250-300 psig.  Acetylene can also be generated to supplement the acetylene supply, using the reaction CaC2 + 2H2O = C2H2 +Ca(OH)2 + heat.  Three parallel compressors are necessary to achieve the pressure required for acetylene charging.  Acetylene gas from Praxair trailers has to go through one Dimethylformamide (DMF) filter and two acetylene purifiers before compression.  The inlet acetylene gas pressure into the compressors is around 5-8 psig.  The maximumacetylene discharge pressure is 400 psig.  In the next step compressed outlet acetylene goes through three parallel moisture removal systems to prevent water contamination of cylinders resulting in decreased cylinder life.  Back pressure regulators are maintained at 200 psig.  After passing through the moisture removing traps, acetylene gas stream then reaches the charging racks to be charged into acetylene cylinders.  Before the charging process adequate acetone contents in the cylinders are checked and added when necessary.  During charging the pressure at the filling racks are around 250 to 400 psig, and cylinders are checked for leaks using soap detection solution.  A cylinder cooling spray system is used on all acetylene cylinder charging racks to provide uniform cooling of cylinders.  At the end of the production process, acetylene cylinders are checked for correct allowable DOT shipping weight at the scales. \n\nThe Risk Management Program for acetylene process is to minimize the possibility of unwanted release of acetylene, thereby decreasing fire hazard to employees and offsite populace.  In Process Safety Information, overview of the process pertaining to safety is provided, along with process flow diagrams.  Process parameters and equipment specifications in the process are also provided.  In Process Hazard Analysis, different scenarios of unwanted release of acetylene are documented and studied; recommendations are provided to strengthen existing safeguards.  Operating Procedures provide standard operational procedures on acetylene filling process.  In Training section, employee training materials for overall acetylene process, safety, and operations are included, along with written quizzes to gauge competence.  Mechanical Integrity provides maintenance schedules and inspections tests for the acetylene process equipments; maintenance procedures and documentations are also included.  Through Mechanical Integrity, ongoing equipment maintenance is implemented on regular schedules, instead of providing maintenance at equipment broke-downs.  Management of Change provides ways in which changes to the process could be studied, approved, tracked, and documented.  Employee input into the prevention program can also be done through Employee Participation, in which employees can contribute to the development of the prevention program, the operational procedures, and etc.  The Incident Investigation section provides systems in which incidents or A?near-missesA? are investigated.  In Hot Work section, the approval procedures are laid out for work with fire risk, along with Hot Work permit approval checklists.  This way the feasibility of hot work can be studied and approved through the system established by Hot Work.  In the Contractor section of the program, procedures for approving and training contractors are established, along with the Contractor Compliance Agreement forms.  The Risk Management Prevent Program is audited by a third party auditor every three years to evaluate the compliance and implementation of the program.  The auditor evaluations will be thoroughly studied and addressed.",

              "Description": "LP-Gas Cylinder Gas Production Plant has one 30,000 gallon Propane tank one 2000 gal Starflame C tank, and one 3930 gal Propylene tank. These LP-Gas bulk storage tanks are equipped with relief valves on the top, and the usual tank pressure is 200 psig. Propane bulk tanks are filled by Propane Resources; propylene bulk tanks are filled by Gas Innovations.  The LP-Gas bulk tanks are protected by multiple onsite water cannon in the event of fire.  The LP-Gas bulk tanks are also protected by a tank deluge system designed by Simplex Grinnell. The deluge on the tank is activated by air actuated valves. The propane tank is equipped with a Corken F14-101 1.5A? Cylinder Pump with 5HP 3450 RPM motor. Coro-flow Model DS/DL pumps are assigned to the 3930 gal Propylene and 2000-gal Starflame C bulk tanks.  The pumps are equipped with relief valves to prevent pump over-pressure as well.  The LP-Gas lines (propane, propylene, and Starflame C) leading to the filling station has a line pressure of 200-300 psig and a delivery capacity of 25-30 gpm.  In the LP-Gas filling station, LPG cylinders are filled by weight. LPG Gas cylinders are filled on a scale with a proximity switch and automatic shutoff. Overfilling of cylinders must be carefully avoided, as LP-Gas may expand in warmer temperatures and cause dangerous situations of over-pressure.  Two fire extinguishers are assigned near the LP-Gas filling station, and a fire alarm switch is located at the filling station for the activation of plant fire alarm and notification of Fire Department.  The activation of the tank deluge also notifies the Fire Department.\n\n\n\n    The Risk Management Program for LP-Gas process is to minimize the possibility of unwanted release of LP-Gas, thereby decreasing fire hazard to employees and offsite populace.  In Process Safety Information, overview of the process pertaining to safety is provided, along with process flow diagrams.  Process parameters and equipment specifications in the process are also provided.  In Process Hazard Analysis, different scenarios of unwanted release of LP-Gas are documented and studied; recommendations are provided to strengthen existing safeguards.  Operating Procedures provide standard operational procedures on LP-Gas filling process.  In Training section, employee training materials for overall LP-Gas process, safety, and operations are included, along with written quizzes to gauge competence.  Mechanical Integrity provides maintenance schedules and inspections tests for the LP-Gas process equipments; maintenance procedures and documentations are also included.  Through Mechanical Integrity, ongoing equipment maintenance is implemented on regular schedules, instead of providing maintenance at equipment break-downs.  Management of Change provides ways in which changes to the process could be studied, approved, tracked, and documented.  Employee input into the prevention program can also be done through Employee Participation, in which employees can contribute to the development of the prevention program, the operational procedures, and etc.  The Incident Investigation section provides systems in which incidents or A?near-missesA? are investigated.  In Hot Work section, the approval procedures are laid out for work with fire risk, along with Hot Work permit approval checklists.  This way the feasibility of hot work can be studied and approved through the system established by Hot Work.  In the Contractor section of the program, procedures for approving and training contractors are established, along with the Contractor Compliance Agreement forms.  The Risk Management Prevent Program is audited by a in house auditor every three years to evaluate the compliance and implementation of the program.  The auditor evaluations will be thoroughly studied and addressed.\n\n",
