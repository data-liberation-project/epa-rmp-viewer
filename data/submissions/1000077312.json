      "SummaryText": "Vinylidene Chloride is one of the co-monomers used to make Methyl Acrylate / Vinylidene Chloride (MA/VDC) resins.  The flash point of Vinylidene Chloride is -18?F (-28?C).  This material is regulated by both RMP and PSM\n\nThis material is received via interplant pipeline from DAS into storage tank T-5. From T-5, Vinylidene chloride is piped to the facility and then is purified by distillation to remove inhibitor.  The distilled Vinylidene chloride is stored in one of two storage tanks T-1 or T-3.  \n\nMA / VDC Process - VDC is loaded to the Methyl Acrylate / VDC suspension reactors from T-1 or T-3.  Following the polymerization reactions, the un-reacted VDC is stripped out of the resin and sent through the recovery system. Recovered material is treated as RCRA Hazardous Waste. Vents from the recovery systems are sent to the HyCon tox unit. The vents are either burned directly or temporarily stored in T-4 tank surge tank.\n\nThe portions of the facility subject to RMP and PSM programs for Vinylidene chloride; starts at the interplant pipeline point of ownership change from DAS to SK Saran.  T-5 located in 590 tank farm, distillation operations, storage in T-1 and T-3, suspension reactors 6, and 7, 591 MA/VDC recovery system / 967 MA/VDC recovery system, HyCon V1V2 surge tank at HyCon, Dry Surge tank at HyCon, T-4 HyCon surge tank in 590 tank farm, and MA/VDC rerun waste isotainer loading stations.\n\n"
