We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Regulated Substances That We Use\n\n\n\nSpoetzl Brewery, Inc. produces and bottles Shiner beer.  The ammonia refrigeration system is a utility system supporting the plant by providing space conditioning for beer/intermediates tank storage and various brewing process areas. The system also provides cooling to generate chilled water or glycol through flooded heat exchangers which, in turn, supplies secondary media and/or direct product cooling. \n\n\n\nWe use and store quantities of Anhydrous Ammonia in excess of 10,000 pounds in our refrigeration system.  Industry has used Anhydrous Ammonia for many years as a coolant because it is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and has an exceptional ability to remove large quantities of heat.  It is designated as an Extremely Hazardous Substance by the Environmental Protection Agency.  However, if stored and handled properly, it is relatively safe to use as a refrigerant.\n\n\n\nC.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nSpoetzl Brewery has adopted a program to meet the requirements of both the the Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management standard (PSM) and EPA.  Spoetzl Brewery maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting the public and plant employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving anhydrous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe multi-faceted program includes:\n\n\n\n* The use of Process Safety Information to document safe process design\n\n* Operating Procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely\n\n* Maintenance, inspection and testing of all "

Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nWithin the past five years, Spoetzl Brewery, Inc., has not had any accidental releases that resulted in injuries or property damage or negative environmental impact.  The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history with no major anhydrous ammonia releases that could have had adverse effects on the employees, the public, property, or the environment\n\n\n\nE.

It addresses measures to protect the lives of employees, contractors, visitors and tourists at the facility.    Training is provided regarding the Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nF. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nSpoetzl Brewery, Inc., continues to strengthen its safety program and continually works to effectively manage the hazards of anhydrous ammonia to protect the community we serve and our employees.
