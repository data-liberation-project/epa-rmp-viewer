In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected, and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nThis facility has been occupied by several owners, and portions of it are very old. Documentation on the original design and construction standards is unavailable, but the newer modifications initiated by the current Owner have been completed by a competent contractor specializing in refrigeration systems.\n\nThere is one engine room on the main floor near the plant entrance.

All areas of the system are protected by relief valves which discharge into the atmosphere.\n\nThe emergency response program is monitored by ammonia detectors located in the engine room. The first level alarm is a threshold alarm which will notify the refrigeration operator that a threshold amount of ammonia has been detected.
