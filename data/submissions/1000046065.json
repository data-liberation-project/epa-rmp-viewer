This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous chemicals. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nClemens Terminal consists of a terminal and storage facility, along with the pipelines that connect this facility to the main plant and its markets. The terminal stores simple olefins, including ethylene and propylene, some C6 products, butadiene, and Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) that are produced by the Sweeny/Old Ocean Facility. These products are primarily intermediates which our customers use to produce finished consumer products such as plastics and packaging, biodegradable detergents, synthetic lubricants, and hydraulic fluids, and waxes. In our process, we use the following chemicals the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nFlammables: Normal Butane, Ethylene, Propane, Ethane, 2-Butene-trans, 1-Butene, 2Butene-cis, Butene, Isobutane, 2-Butene, Hydrogen, Isopentane, Methane, Pentane, 1,3-Butadiene, Propylene, Isoprene, 1-Pentene.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the General Accidental Release Prevention Program in place at the Clemens Terminal. Because processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary "

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Clemens Terminal's Accidental Release Prevention Program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the Accidental Release Prevention Program are documented in the Employee Participation Element of the Clemens Terminal Process Safety Management System. In addition, Clemens Terminal has a number of teams to promote both process safety and personal safety. The teams typically involve members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering and plant management.\n\n\n\nTwo key areas for employee participation include the Employee Behavioral Safety Process (RAPTOR) and the Employee EHS Excellence Team.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nClemens Terminal maintains a variety of technical documents that are used in the safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date Process Safety Information. Process Safety Information reference documents are readily available as part of the written Employee Participation Plan to help employees locate any necessary Process Safety Information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs).

The teams verify the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nClemens Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to confirm the safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nClemens Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nClemens Terminal primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The team employs a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) to assist with this task.\n\n\n\nThe PHA Team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.

This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo confirm that process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design features Clemens Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nClemens Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) Unit startup, (2) Normal operations, (3) Temporary operations, (4) Emergency shutdown, (5) Normal shutdown, and (6) Initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change process.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Clemens Terminal maintains a Process Safety Information document that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to saf"

Training for process operators is managed by the plant Training Department and includes rigorous initial hire or job transfer training with classroom and on-the-job elements. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) that they have adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to confirm their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nClemens Terminal uses contractors as part of its regular work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to verify that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a Process Overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) Emergency Response Plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Clemens Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of the contractor. Plant personnel periodically conduc"

The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make certain construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that Accidental Release Prevention Program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nClemens Terminal has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, control, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) Equipment Identification and categorization, (2) conducting training, (3) developing written procedures, (4) performing inspections, tests and preventive maintenance, (5) correcting identified deficiencies, and (6) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) Emergency Response Plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a cross functional Team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance. Sweeny/Old Ocean incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nClemens Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.\n\nExamples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel (B.17), (2) a Lockout/Tagout Procedure (B.6) to verify isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened (B.20), (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work, B.1), (5) a permit and procedure to confirm adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space (B.2), and (6) a Safety and Emergency Systems Bypass Permit procedure (C.4).

Changes are reviewed to (1) verify adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nClemens Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the Root Cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management and respective Teams for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until these actions have been resolved. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with employees (including contractors) who could be affected by these findings.

      "SummaryText": "Audits\n\nClemens Terminal periodically conducts compliance audits that include the following: Internal PSM and RMP Audits, Designated Self Audits (Safety and Health), and Operational Excellence (OE) Audit (which contains all elements of Responsible Care Evaluations). Audit teams comprised of both hourly and management personnel conduct these audits. Audits for compliance with both the PSM and RMP regulatory requirements are conducted at least every three years according to the corporate auditing protocol. Some audits or evaluations of individual process safety elements may be conducted in the intervening years according to a specific need for that area. Audit findings are developed and presented to management for resolution. All responses to audit findings are tracked until resolution. All audits are retained for at least 5 years.\n\n\n\nRisk Management Process\n\nIn addition to the OSHA PSM elements described above, Clemens Terminal incorporates the elements of Chevron Phillips' Operational Excellence Program in the Safety and Health process of the facility. The elements of this management process include the following:\n\n\n\nResponsible Care (Codes of Management Practice)\n\n(1) Leadership, Commitment, and Responsibility\n\n(2) Training\n\n(3) Community Awareness and Outreach\n\n(4) Emergency Response and Preparedness\n\n(5) Pollution Prevention and Resource Conservation\n\n(6) Process Safety\n\n(7) Distribution\n\n(8) Employee Health and Safety\n\n(9) Product Stewardship\n\n(10) Regulatory Assessment and Advocacy\n\n(11) Compliance Assurance and Reviews\n\n\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at Clemens Terminal have hazards that must be managed to help ensure continued safe operation.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including the following: proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures; evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation; notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occur; and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, Clemens Terminal has procedures that address maintenance inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The Emergency Response Program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.\n\n\n\nThe overall Emergency Response Program for Clemens Terminal is coordinated with the Brazoria County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes: local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. Clemens Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Clemens Terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations. In addition to the LEPC, the Clemens Terminal also has a Mutual Aid System in place. The Emergency Assistance Agreement Committee (EAAC) is"
