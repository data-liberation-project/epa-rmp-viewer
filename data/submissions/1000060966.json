Red Trail Energy has evaluated chemicals stored on site with respect to the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances.  Red Trail Energy stores an RMP-regulated flammable mixture (denaturant) above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds; Red Trail Energy also stores an RMP-regulated toxic chemical (anhydrous ammonia) above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  Red Trail Energy began operation in January 2007; the first RMP was submitted for the facility in November 2006 and a 5-year update was submitted in November 2011.  This RMP Submit represents a 5-year recertification.  Red Trail Energy is subject to the Occupation Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, and off-site receptors are present within the worst-case release distance for both the regulated toxic and regulated flammable material; therefore, both the regulated toxic and regulated flammable materials are subject to RMP Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nRed Trail Energy is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically anhydrous ammonia and natural gasoline, an RMP-regulated flammable used as the ethanol denaturant.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Red Trail Energy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of toxics and/or flammables, it is the policy of Red Trail Energy to notify the Richardton Fire Department and Stark County Sheriff Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.

      "SummaryText": "\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  Anhydrous ammonia is stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline), which is a Class 4 Flammable and may contain the following RMP-regulated flammable materials (25% butane, 5% ethane, 8% iso-butane, 20% iso-pentane, 17% pentane, and 25% propane).  NOTE: The exact mixture of RMP-regulated flammable materials in the denaturant can vary.  The natural gasoline is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant in place of natural gasoline and does not contain any regulated constituents above the threshold quantity.  Red Trail Energy has evaluated the worst-case and alternative release scenarios as it related to the reportable substances.  Emergency response for these scenarios has been prepared and implemented. Red Trail Energy has coordinated emergency response with the local authorities and will conduct periodic drills.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Red Trail Energy has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA PSM requirements.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRed Trail Energy has not had any accidents of RMP-regulated substances which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.
