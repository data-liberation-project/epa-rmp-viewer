The FC facility at Elmore is in the business of selling anhydrous ammonia to farm customers as a form of nitrogen fertilizer. The location includes anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, nurse tank filling risers, electrical equipment and panels, lighting, and anhydrous ammonia safety equipment. The facility is manned during the spring and fall fertilizer seasons during normal business hours and some after hours periods.\n\n3. FC's accidental release prevention plan is based on the following key elements:\n\n* Annual training of all personnel required to handle ammonia and what to do in an emergency.\n\n* Facilities constructed and maintained acording to Minnesota Dept. of Ag rules and regulations.\n\n*Use of usual anhydrous ammonia safety equipment.\n\n* Use of effective operating procedures according to Agricom's anhydrous ammonia safety procedures handbook and training videos.\n\n* Annual inspections by Minnesota Dept. of Ag of storage tanks, piping for leaks, nurse tanks, applicators, transfer risers, riser hoses, safety equipment, pressure relief valve records, etc.\n\n* Fc site inspections by safety committee members at least twice a year.\n\n4. No accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5.
