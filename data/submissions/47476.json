If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Morris Fire Department, Grundy County LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary acitivity at the facility, which is located on Lisbon Road is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distgributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 30,000 gallon storage tank, loading riser, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 299,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupantional Safety and Health Administratiion (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nThe facility has:  a written eme"
