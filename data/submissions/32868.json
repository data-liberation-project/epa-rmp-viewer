(Wabash Alloys) is committed to maintaining a safe work environment for our employees, contractors, visitors, and surrounding public.  Our facility regularly meets with outside responders, local fire departments, and local emergency planning committees in order to establish emergency response procedures necessary to protect our surrounding public and the environment.\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Wabash Alloys facility in Cleveland, Ohio produces recycled secondary specification aluminum alloys.  The Cleveland facility has a Program 3 covered process due to the onsite storage and use of chlorine.  Chlorine is used at the facility to remove magnesium from molten aluminum.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is covered by both USEPA's Risk Management Program rule, as well as, OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule for the chlorine covered process.  This facility implements one combined Process Safety and Risk Management Program.  This program consists of a written management system that complies with both USEPA's and OSHA's requirements.  The backbone of the program is the Management of Change Procedure.  This procedure enables the facility to initiate and complete process changes associated with the chlorine system while maintaining the Process Safety and Risk Management Program requirements at the facility.  \n\nBoth the worst-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled based on equipment failure, therefore, the mechanical integrity element of the program is key in preventing releases from the chlorine process.  This facility utilizes a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) to implement the preventative maintenance, testing and inspection of the chlorine system.  The CMMS supports the routine preventative maintenance program, which in combination wit"

No one offsite was injured, nor were any homes or local businesses evacuated.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nIn the event of a release which could result in an offsite impact, the Cleveland Fire Prevention Bureau will be contacted to respond and to alert the general public.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nWe have purchased additional safety equipment and conducted employee training.  The facility will continue to make imrpovements as identified through our employee participation and internal auditing programs."
