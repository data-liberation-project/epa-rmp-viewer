The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration process and has several methods for ensuring employee and public safety associated with this process.  The facility has developed procedures, plans and policies for the operation of the ammonia process and for dealing with unexpected accidental releases.  MillerCoors has implemented a process safety management program which enhances safety by regular maintenance and inspections, hazard analysis, compliance audits, employee and contractor training, employee participation, ammonia monitoring/detection, and other activities.  The facility also has emergency response procedures and plans to promote chemical safety in the event of an emergency situation.\n\nMillerCoors engages in the production of malt beverages.   As part of the brewing process, an ammonia refrigeration system is utilized.  Due to the quantity of ammonia maintained on-site, the facility is subject to the Risk Management Program regulations which are intended to promote safety at the facility and general public level. In accordance with 40 cfr 65.155 and 69 FR 18819, a worse-case releasae senario was modeled to determine the greatest impact a release of ammonia from the facility could reasonable cause. An alternative release scenario is a scenario which is more likely to occur, and could have offsite consequences. \n\nThe MillerCoors LLC facility is also subject to the Process Safety Management regulations under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  As a result of these regulations, the facility has implemented a program to further enhance process safety which involves operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity (maintenance related issues), pre-start-up-review, management of change, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot wo"
