The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant for ice manufacturing and public storage refrigeration systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility has two refrigeration systems, one for the ice manufacturing process and one for the cold storage system. Both systems are closed-circuit mechanical refrigeration design using anhydrous ammonia as their refrigerant. Each system has numerous protective controls (motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, and high/ low oil pressure) that will shut down the compressor(s) if operating limits are exceeded.\n\n\n\nBoth systems incorporate multiple screw compressors, a high-pressure ammonia storage receiver and low-pressure ammonia vessels, evaporative condensers, and a common ammonia blow-down system. In addition, the icemaker system includes four icemakers, while the cold storage system includes nineteen room evaporators, three blast evaporators, an under floor heating system, and several smaller vessels. Four additional evaporators can be operated from either system as required.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility's program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\n\n\nThe facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the anhydrous ammonia process. These include an ammonia detection and alarm system, normal and emergency ventilation systems, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits ar"

This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice corporate and Reddy Ice-Las Vegas management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (\"PSM/RMP\") Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The combined PSM/RMP Program contains fourteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, process safety information, process hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, incident investigation, compliance audits, emergency planning and response, and trade secrets.

The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. An established safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (\"OCAs\") for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified. \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Las Vegas facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (\"EAP\") that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation and response procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the emergency action plan.
