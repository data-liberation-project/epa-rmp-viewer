If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information - The primary activity at this facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received,stored, and distributed for direct application to crops for crop production.   The maximun quantity stored would be 60,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank. \n\nThe worst-case and alternate release scenario - The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be  60,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .84 miles.  The alternate release scenario, based on a 2 minute release from the break of a 3 inch pipe, would be a distance to an endpoint of .78 miles.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program - The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\"  In addition this  facility follows MN Department of Agriculure rules.    \n\nFive-year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\nto our knowledge, have resulted in"
