The worst case release scenario assumes that all the contents in the largest single PV (i.e. 18,000 gallons) are released.   The release scenario consists of the PV being punctured on the side at the ground level and the release is modeled as a ground level horizontal jet at the maximum temperature.\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a 30-second release from a failure of a 2-inch transfer hose caused by an impact, pull-away, material defect, or overpressurization during a transfer operation.  Mitigation by engineering and administrative controls is considered in these scenarios.  \n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Operations Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operations Manager is assisted by other Facility staff, as directed.  The Operations Manager is responsible for ensuring that Facility Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThis is a non-responding Facility.   The Facility has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at this Facility.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by the Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Facility adds, deletes, or makes changes to the"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis electronic EPA RMP was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68.  Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.  This electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\nThe Facility is submitting this as a 5-year update.  All relevant sections of the Facility RMPr have been reviewed and/or updated.  \n\nFACILITY\n\nThe operations at this Facility consist of agricultural fertilizer retail sale and distribution.  The Facility operates one (1) covered process that includes Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia at quantities that exceed the regulatory threshold quantity.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to this Facility by a third party owned and operated commercial cargo truck.  The cargo truck Operator transfers anhydrous ammonia from the commercial cargo truck to one of two stationary pressure vessels (PVs), one having a capacity of 18,000 gallons and the other 12,000 gallons.\n\nThe Facility stores the anhydrous ammonia in the one stationary PV and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the PV to Facility-owned nurse tanks at the point of retail sale to the end user (i.e. Grower/Farmer).  Trained Process Operators perform the transfer of anhydrous ammonia in accordance with its R"
