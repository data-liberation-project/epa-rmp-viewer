If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify City of Maquoketa Fire Department and Jackson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail fertilizer plant.  We sell fertilizer and pesticides to area farmers.  Anhydrous is used as a form of nitrogen for crop use.  Our storage system consists of one 18,000 gallon tank with plumbing.\n\nOur worst case scenerio is a gas release of our 18,000 gallon tank.  According to EPA's RMP Comp the distance to the endpoint is 3.6 miles.  Included in this area is the city of Maquoketa, population 6,113.\n\nThe Alternative release scenario is the break of a transfer hose which would have the potential of releasing 26,638 lbs. of anhydrous in 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint is .78 miles affecting a population of 2,000.  Emergency shut down systems, including excess flow valves and breakaway couplers, will mitigate the release.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This anhydrous system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with the Iowa Department of Ag & Land Stewardship.\n\nThe facility has never had an accident involving anhydrous that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the City of Maquoketa Fire Department and the Jackson County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department.\n\nSafety is an ongoing effort with the administration and employees working hand and hand to promote safety through training and continued effort to maintain the facility."
