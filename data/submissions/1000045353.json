The two chemicals are chlorine dioxide and chlorine.  Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on site for use in the pulp mill as the primary bleaching agent.  Chlorine dioxide is stored in three 63,000-gallon tanks which is greater than the threshold of 1000 lbs.  The worst-case scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupturing of one of the tanks.  There is a containment area to hold the contents of the release.  This scenario has not changed.  The alternative scenario is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide pipe in the pipe bridge above the road.  This scenario remains the same.  The chlorine is located at the filter plant in a quantity greater than 2500 lbs.  The chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers.  The worst-case scenario is the rupture of one of the containers.  The alternate case scenario has been changed to a break in the ?\" line from the container, before the automatic shutoff valve.  \n\n\n\nBecause the Risk Management Plan was updated in 2019, the most recent census from 2010 was used.  \n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThe accident history from Ju"

The Halsey Pulp Mill is in Halsey, Oregon. The company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Halsey Pulp Mill. One component of this system is the risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Halsey Pulp Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Halsey Pulp Mill.  The risk management program consists of three elements:\n\n\n\n1.    A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nSince the mill was constructed in 1969, a prevention program has been in place to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, Halsey Pulp Mill formalized this prevention program for the filter plant to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1998, prior to the building of the chlorine dioxide generator, Halsey Pulp Mill began implementing OSHA process safety management. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established a requirement for facilities with listed material greater than the threshold quantity to plan for possible off-site consequences of a release.  There are three planning program levels.  Both Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide fall under the Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\n\n\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program\n\nThe Program 3 prevention program for chlorine and chlorine dioxide consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information. The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of chlorine and chlorine dioxide, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment. These documents are also used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment. The process safety information is available to all employees, the local emergency personnel, and the fire department.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis.  The facility performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHA's) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the saf"

A team composed of operating and engineering personnel with process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process. The Halsey Pulp Mill uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis. The team prepares a written report describing the results of the analyses, including a list of recommendations. Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the appropriate personnel and, when necessary, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures.  Halsey Pulp Mill personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets. Operating procedures include:\n\n1.    ? Steps for safely conducting activities\n\n2.    ? Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations.  Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs.\n\n\n\nTraining.  Employees are trained to safely and effectively perform assigned tasks. The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.
