Indian Trail Distribution Center submits this Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Indian Trail, North Carolina facility.  Harris TeeterA\u00bfs operations include the warehousing of grocery products for public consumption. Harris Teeter has been in operation at this facility for 37 years providing quality grocery products and over 425 jobs to the local community.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nHarris Teeter is committed to protecting the health of its associates, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Harris TeeterA\u00bfs policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Organization (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHAA\u00bfs Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120). \r\n\r\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nHarris Teeter is subject to section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  Harris Teeter is required to maintain low temperatures in the food warehousing areas of the facility that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the delivered products.  Harris Teeter uses anhydrous ammonia (the 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain 290,512  ft2 within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is a typical refrigerant for food warehousing. Harris TeeterA\u00bfs refrigeration system consisting of a receiver, a recirculator, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping can contain a maximum amount of 20,000 po"

To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Harris Teeter has implemented several precautionary measures.  \r\n\r\nHarris Teeter has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (pressure relief valves, check valves, diffusion tank, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs, ammonia leak detection system, interlocks, emergency power and air, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Harris Teeter has spent time with the local Hazmat team who would respond to potential ammonia releases and the Hazmat team has toured the facility to become familiar with the location of the system equipment, valves and emergency shut-offs.\r\n\r\nHarris Teeter has developed standard operating procedures (SOP) for all associates and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system, that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an as-needed basis. Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed anytime there is a change in the process or SOP.  Harris Teeter requires associate participation in development of overall safety measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters, Safety Committee and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Harris Teeter, any changes to the operating procedures are to be communicated to affected employees.\r\n\r\nHarris Teeter understands that maintaining th"

The preventative maintenance program is scheduled, documented and managed by the Warehouse Maintenance Manager to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that Harris TeeterA\u00bfs control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system:\r\n\r\n? In accordance with the PSM program, Harris Teeter conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\r\n \r\n? In addition, Harris Teeter is audited by a third party contractor on an annual basis.\r\n \r\n? Harris TeeterA\u00bfs insurance carrier also conducts independent audits on an annual\r\n      basis.\r\n\r\n? The State of North Carolina Department of Labor, Boiler Safety Bureau conducts an assessment on the pressure vessels every two years.\r\n\r\n? The USDA and FDA audits the facility on an annual basis.\r\n \r\n Five-Year Accident History\r\n \r\n The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system began operating at the Indian Trail location in spring 2006. A five-year accident history has not been established.\r\n \r\n \r\n Emergency Response Program\r\n \r\n Harris Teeter has documented emergency response procedures in three documents entitled Special Situation Manual, Emergency Evacuation Program and Emergency Response Plan in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an on-site or off-site anhydrous ammonia release.

Personnel that work on the ammonia system receive 24-hours of initial training and 8-hour update training every year.  These associates are also trained in the proper use of respirators and receive an annual fit test and pulmonary function test to aid in offensive mitigation.\r\n \r\n To assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Harris TeeterA\u00bfs emergency response procedures, Harris Teeter has met with the local fire departments and Hazmat team. \r\n \r\n To plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Harris Teeter includes procedures/equipment to offensively mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route maps, and procedures for public communication.\r\n \r\n In addition to the local response agencies, Harris Teeter has arranged emergency response assistance with a local clean-up contractor.\r\n \r\n In the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\r\n \r\n? Broadcast message via the Union County Central Dispatch\r\n \r\n? Police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems, and\r\n \r\n? Door-to-door notification of residents (if time permits).\r\n \r\n Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n \r\n As a result of Harris TeeterA\u00bfs initial process hazard analyses and new system design, a few changes were planned at the facility to improve safety and prevent anhydrous ammonia releases.  These changes included improvements to preventative maintenance program, relocation of emergency equipment to a safer location, increased protection of ammonia equipment (e.g., guarding), increased ammonia safety training, installation of windsocks, improvements to security and formalizing inspections."
