      "SummaryText": "Schreiber Foods, Inc. (\"SFI\")  is a  cheese processor.  Schreiber Foods operates three facilities in Clinton, Missouri employing over450 people.  One of these facilities, the David D. Nusbaum cheese processing facility at 935 Nusbaum Place, uses anhydrous ammonia for refrigeration of the product in manufacturing.  Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nPursuant to the RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management  (PSM) regulations, SFI has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect our partners and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemcials onsite.  The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If? Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration.  The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the DDN facility as well as experienced facilitators from an outside engineering firm.\n\nSFI's implementation of the PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exxposure to accidental releases of ammonia.  The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system.  The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to welding and similar hot work) and safety requirements for contractors who may be hired to work on the system.  \n\nLastly, the PSM writen program incorporates the DDN plant's emergency response plan and places special emphasis on handling accidental releases of hazardous chemicals and coordination of emergency response with local fire departments and other emergency response organizations.\n\nAs part of the RMP requirements, SFI undertook a review of the pot"

Following are a description of the results.  \n\nAmmonia Refrigeration\n\nSFI stores and uses anhydrous ammonia on site for refrigeration of products in process and in storage.  Ammonia is used for its excellent energy efficiency and flexibility, in addition to benefirs to employee safety.  Ammonia in the facility is kept entirely within the refrigeration system, much as the refrigerant in your car air-conditioner.  The DDN plant has never experienced a release of ammonia involving consequences that affected residents or the environment.\n\nThe worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 6,884 pound capacity of the high pressure receiver which is located indoors.  The analysis of this release indicates that a potential exposure of an area approximately 0.78 miles in diameter (distance to endpoint of 0.39 miles).  The total population within the potential exposure area is 135. Residences are located within this area.\n\nIn determining the alternate case scenario for ammonia, SFI analyzed incidents occurring at other non-SFI refrigeration facilities and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA).  The scenario chosen for the ammonia system assumes a 1/2\" hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers.  Such a release would affect an area of 0.34 miles (0.17 miles to the toxic endpoint) and create the potential to affect approximately 26 persons. Residences are located within this area.\n\nSFI is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the DDN plant.  Facility management is involved in the design, operation, and maintenance of the system.  Schreiber partners at all levels have been involved in the development of the PSM and RMP programs.  Management has committed to working with local agencies and"
