If an amergency were to occur, we would notify the\nDavis County LEPC and the Bloomfield Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\nThis facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center. As such, we store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers, including Anhydrous Ammonia. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by truck, is handled and stored on site and is a regulated substance by EPA, requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We sell Anhydrous to grower customers in 1000 gallon nurse tanks. The customer applies the ammonia into the soil as a source of nitrogen fertilizer for growing Agricultural crops. This facility maintains approx. 44 - 1000 gallon nurse tanks for customer delivery. Our combined storage capacity in nurse tanks is 193,000 pounds. Anhydrous Ammonia is stored in one stationary storage tank @ 18,000 gallon on site. 79,000 pounds of Anhdrous is the maximum storage capacity of our Stationary Storage Tanks. The total Anhydrous Ammonia storage capacity for our  facility is 272,000 pounds. The largest storage tank at our facility contains 79,000 pounds. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO - Our worst case scenario is the loss of the total contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), released as  a gas over 10 minutes, resulting in total vaporization. The maximum quantity released would be 79,000 pounds. According to DEGADIS  modeling this release (distance to point of dispersion to 200PPM) would have off site impact. It should be noted that Troy Elevator has never had a release of the entire Stationary storage tank. ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO - The most common alternative release scenario from our facility would not reach an end point off-site, the alternative release scenario modeled for the purp"

The total amount of Anhydrous Ammonia released in this scenario would be 12,000 pounds. This release scenario ( distance to point of dispersion to 200PPM) would have off site impact. It should be noted that Troy Elevator has not had a release of this type from it's facility. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.  The ammonia system is designed, installed and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes. This facility complies with the ANSI K61.1 Standards (1989), OSHA (29CFR1910.11) EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. Our ammonia system is protected from major releases by Internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shut-offs and emergency shutoff valves. The load out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks ar protected by excess flow valves and full line breakaways to immediately stop flow of ammonia if a line or hose fails. All main storage tank valves and the riser load out valves are locked when not in rise. Our ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, guages and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to guidelines in the ANSI standards. Training is provided to all employees at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process or whenever competency with regulations is questioned. The training consists of classroom lecture, current videos, testing and certification and also on the job training. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY - There has been no accident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused deaths, injuries - property or environmental damage including evacution on or off site.

      "SummaryText": "ent of an emergency involving our ammonia system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency. In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local responce agencies by providing information to ensure that they are familiar with and are properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and migating the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPC RA and coordinated with the LEPC. In addition, Troy Elevator has as Emergency Action Plan for its facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29CFR1910.38). The plan includes public notification, provisions for initial medical care, evacuations and LEPC coordination. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY -  We do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfers and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenence on all of the ammonia equipment."
