Bolthouse Farms, Inc.\n7200 East Brundage Lane\nBakersfield, CA 93307-3099\n(661) 366-7209\nFAX (661) 366-8410\n\nJune 17, 2004\n\n\n\n\nThis technical study was conducted for the Wm. Bolthouse Farms facility located in Bakersfield, California to fulfill the Hazard Assessment (Off-Site Consequence Analysis) requirements of the following regulations:\n\n?\tEPA\u00bfs 40 CFR Part 68, Risk Management Program (RMP), \u00a768.20\n?\tCalifornia Office of Emergency Services, California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, \u00a72750\n\nThe Wm. Bolthouse Farms facility is located at 7200 East Brundage Lane in Bakersfield, California.  The facility is located just North of State Highway 58 approximately 6.5 miles East of Highway 99.  The area surrounding the Wm. Bolthouse Farms facility is primarily industrial and agricultural with residential areas to the North of the facility.  A local map indicating the location of the facility with respect to the surrounding area is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is ammonia.  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in multiple refrigeration systems that are used for processing various carrot products and for associated cold storage.\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration Processes\n\nThe four refrigeration systems at the facility include the following:\n\n\u00bf\tFoodservice / West Plant\n\u00bf\tNorth Shortcuts\n\u00bf\tFreezer / IQF\n\u00bf\tCello / Main\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within in each refrigeration system.  Each of the systems operate theoretically similar in that they consist of piping, valves, and equipment, that cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for process equipment and cold storage rooms.

      "SummaryText": "ectly related to changes in temperature.  For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing heat from the product or from the refrigerated space.  Removal of heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize.  Heat is later transferred from the ammonia and rejected to the atmosphere as the ammonia gas is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions in each of the four refrigeration systems at the facility range from vacuum on the low pressure side of the system to 150-175 psig on the high side.\n\nWm. Bolthouse Farms prepared an extensive Hazard Assessment in 1999 that addressed the regulatory requirements for the worst case and alternative release scenario based on the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements.  This Update was prepared to supplement the initial study as follows:\n\n\u00bf\tProvide one worst case scenario and alternative release scenarios according to the definitions provided by the CalARP Program regulation, and\n\u00bf\tUpdate the maps, population estimates, and receptor information.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nNo significant ammonia releases have occurred at the Wm. Bolthouse Farms within the last 5 years. No injuries or deaths have occurred at the facility due to ammonia leaks within the last 5 years.\n\nAmmonia Chemical Properties[1]\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas or liquid with a very strong, intensely irritating odor. It has a Department of Transportation classification as a non-flammable gas but it does have explosion potential when mixed with air and the appropriate initiator is present.  This flammability range is very narrow, 16-25%.  Explosions, when they occur, are usually in confined spaces and require a high-energy initiator such as an electric arc.  The chemical properties of ammonia are shown below in Table 1.\n\n\tTABLE 1 Chemical Properties of Ammonia[1,4]\n\n\nMolecular Formula\t\nNH3\n\nCAS Number\t\n7664-41-7\n\nMolecular Weight"
