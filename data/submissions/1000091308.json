The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n  1.)  To save lives.\n\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\n\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated as necessary. \n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with Fulton County Emergency Management Agency and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance and assistance and maintenance following the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nConstruction of the ammonia refrigeration system at Costco Wholesale was completed in November 2000.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  The facility is located at 4250 S. Fulton Parkway in Union City, Georgia about 3 miles west of the junction of the Interstate 85 and Interstate 285 freeways.  The immediate area is primarily undeveloped with some light commercial areas.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses approximately 26,000 pounds of ammonia for cros"

The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels, compressors, and associated piping.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEP\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tanks, ammonia sensors in the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to the water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has not had any reportable ammonia releases during the past 5 years (December 2015\n\n- December 2020).  No injuries have occurred at the facility due to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration\n\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.

Costco management will determine if an evacuation is necessary.  They will call 911 in order to reach the appropriate HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe ongoing implementation of the PSM / RMP elements provide mitigation measures to improve safety at the Coscto Wholesale facility. Most of the items include methods to better implement the programs, training, staying abreast of industry standards. "
