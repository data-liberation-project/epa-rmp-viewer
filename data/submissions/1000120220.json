This commitment is evidenced by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, the Memphis site utilizes the highly trained local Memphis Fire and contractors to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Organic chemical synthesis.  We have 4 RMP toxic and flammable substances regulated at our facility.  The substance Furan is involved in several uses throughout plant including as a raw material and a commercial chemical product.  There is also Cyclohexylamine, Aqueous Ammonia, and Dimethylamine 40% which are used as raw materials in our specialties product manufacturing area to make other commercial chemical products.  Unlike Furan that is piped and used throughout the plant, these chemicals are stored in isolated locations in totes/drums and a small tank (DMA). \n\n3.\tThe Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario. In order to perform the required off-site consequence analysis, the Pennakem Memphis facility used EPA's RMP COMP software.  While Pennakem Memphis has a program to respond to a release of furan, this worst-case scenario does not allow any active mitigation to be considered and further requires the release to occur under conditions that are not indicative of"

      "SummaryText": "any conditions which have been encountered. The following paragraphs provide details of both the worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release of furan over a short period of time.  The furan liquid is assumed to be immediately released from a total tank failure, in which evaporation takes place. Cyclohexylamine and Aqueous Ammonia were the other Program 3 toxic substance submitted as alternative scenarios. These substances are stored in totes and drums and most likely would have a event that includes puncturing or rupturing of the drum/totes.  One alternative release scenario is included for furan as part of the Program 3 processes. The alternative release scenario allows use of active and passive mitigation.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances also involves releasing dimethylamine (DMA) over a short period of time.  However, DMA is aquesous solution and is stored and used from a tank.  An alternative release scenario for this flammable substance was also evaluated.\n\n4.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with State Building codes.  A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 including the one containing furan.  Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPennakem, LLC Memphis Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess H"

      "SummaryText": "azard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is either HAZOP or What-if Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at an interval of at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  Please note that for Cyclohexylamine, it is used in a process that has not ran in the past 5 years.   However, we store this raw material in a quantity that slightly exceeds the threshold.  \n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Pennakem Memphis Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround, as well as consiquences of deviation from approved standard operating procedures.
