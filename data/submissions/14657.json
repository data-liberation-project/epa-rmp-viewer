      "SummaryText": "The City of Nicholasville operates a drinking water processing plant in compliance with all federal, state.\nand local regulations. The Water Treatment Plant is located southeast of the center of town at 595 Water\nWorks Road. There have been no accidents which exposed the community to toxic chemicals. \n\nAll operations at the plant are designed and operated to the highest safety standards, and all operating\npersonnel are certified by the state of Kentucky. In the purification of water the process utilizes chlorine\ngas in 1-ton cylinders. Chlorine gas is known to be an extremely toxic and corrosive gas. In order to\nprovide safe working conditions for the employees, a safety system is in place.  The primary safety system\nfor the chlorine consists of one chlorine leak detector located in the chlorinating room. The detector is\ncalibrated to react with a minimum of 1 PPM chlorine gas. If a chlorine gas leak is detected, an internal\nalarm is within the room is activated, and a red flashing light will be activated, and an alarm condition\nwill appear on the monitor of the computer control system.  \n\nRealizing the possibility of exposing the public to leaks from the plant, a process hazard review and risk\nassessment has been performed to determine what could possibly happen and what the proper emergency\nresponse should be.  \n\nFortunately, present analysis indicated that the most likely scenario would be a leak in the tubing in the\nprocess area. Such a leak would be limited to an area approximately one half mile around the center of the\nplant. All local emergency response agencies and the state agencies are aware of this exposure, and have\nin place specific response processes. \n\nThis Risk Management Procedure (RMP) is for your use. Additional or more detailed information can be\nmade available. The city of Nicholasville will continue to review  the risks to our community and update\nour training and emergency response procedures."
