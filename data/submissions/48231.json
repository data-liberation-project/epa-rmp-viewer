      "SummaryText": "The El Paso Water Utilities - Public Service Board (EPWU-PSB) has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorination process at the Haskell R. Street Waste Water Treatment Plant, in compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nThe main objectives of this RMP are to: \n\n? Communicate the extent of a possible chlorine release and identify possible receptors (Hazard Assessment), \n\nThe Hazard Assessment communicates the possible extent of a worst case release and an alternative ?more likely? release. The Hazard Assessment also identifies potential public and environmental receptors that may be affected in the event of a chlorine release.\n\n? Develop strategies to prevent an accidental release (Prevention Program), \n\nThe goal of the Prevention Program is to integrate technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the probability of an accidental chlorine release. The Prevention Program incorporates safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations.\n\n? Formulate contingency planning in the case of an accidental release (Emergency Response Program).\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is modeled after the EPWU-PSB?s ?Emergency Response Action Plan? and the Chlorine Institute?s ?Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.? The Emergency Response Program incorporates an emergency response plan, emergency response equipment procedures, training in relevant procedures for employees involved in the chlorination process, and procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe EPWU-PSB plans to review and revise, as necessary, the chlorination process operating procedures in order to minimize the human factors that may lead to accidental releases."
