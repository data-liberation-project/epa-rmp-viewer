Brainerd Chemical Co., Inc. has one chemical on site that has exceeded the threshold limits and is subject to RMP.  This chemical is 37% Formaldehyde.\n\nIt is expected that the worst case release of Formaldehyde would be from one of the tanks that is located outside.  (Note that there are four tanks containing 13,500 pounds each.)  The worst case scenario shows that the toxic endpoint would be located approximately 6.2 miles from the facility.  It should be noted that the containers are in a secondary containment area and the most likely loss to the environment would be a hose or valve failure, resulting in the loss of only approximately 550 gallons.  \n\nThe facility is located in an area of light industry.  The nearest school is approximately 1.3 miles north and the nearest park is approximately 1.5 miles.  There are residences in these areas that are projected to be affected by any of the evaluated releases from this facility.  Further, downtown Tulsa is within a 2 mile radius and will be densely populated during business hours, as will the campus of OSU Tulsa, located approximately the same distance to the southeast.  There is also a jail located on the north side of downtown Tulsa.  In the event of a release, these areas would have to be notified.  The contingency plan currently states that the radio stations and emergency responders would be notified.  This plan also contains the telephone numbers to the schools that are also located in the area.\n\nIt has also been learned that there is sufficient quantity of formaldehyde on site to require the facility to engage in Process Safety Management, thus making the facility a Level 3 PSM Program.  The facility has concluded a HAZOP on the affected process.  There were few operations hazards identified.  The written programs required by PSM regulations, and thus also "

The only contractors on site are drivers which transport the bulk product on site.  These contractors are trained as to Brainerd?s procedures for loading and unloading those materials.  This training is conducted by their employers, who certify the training has been successfully completed.  Due to the fact that the facilities structures are mostly constructed of PVC or other similar materials, there is no reason for the facility to develop a Hot Work Program.  All other programs were reviewed and revised prior to August 1, 2005."
