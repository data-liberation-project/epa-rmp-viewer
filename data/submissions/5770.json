Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Baker Petrolite Corporation in Knox City, Texas are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with Knox City Fire Department which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution center for oil service chemicals.  We have one (1) regulated substances present at our facility.  This substance is Acrolein [2-Propenal].    Acrolein [2-Propenal] is used for  H2S Scavenger & FeS Scavenger.\n\nThe maximum possible inventory of Acrolein [2-Propenal] at our facility is 27,000 lb., the average daily quantity is generally much less. \n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the TRACE model.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Acrolein Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 2450 lb. of Acrolein [2-Propenal].  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  \n\nThe a"
