Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices\nTo insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Inc., Monett Processing Plant, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \n\nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Inc., Monett Processing Plant, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled\nX SIC Code:\t2015\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPoultry Slaughter, Further Processing plant\nX Use of regulated substances: \t\t\t\tAmmonia\nX Amount of each regulated substance:\t\t45,378 (Maximum inventory)\t\t\n  \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s)\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing  20,000 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will  be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation  occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the  possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2"

      "SummaryText": "% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of  20,000 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 1.63 mile radius before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\nAlternative release scenario i:  An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of ammonia in 5 minutes.  The loss of 500 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of 450 feet before no longer posing a health hazard to the public.  The ammonia system is equipped with high pressure cutouts that help to prevent releases of this nature.  Operator training to prevent upset conditions is also required. This facility has had 1 release in the past 5 years due to a relief valve.\n \n4.  The general accidental release prevention program\n\nThis facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n\t\nTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators. \n \n5.  Five-year accident history\n\nMarch 14, 1996:  Anhydrous Ammonia release occurred during a maintenance procedure.  Refrigeration personnel were changing belts on the condenser towers.  This is a preventative maintenance procedure, conducted at least annually.  During this process a relief valve released approximately 275 pounds of liquid/vapor Anhydrous Ammonia into the atmosphere.  There were no reported injuries during this incident.\n\n6.   The emergency response program\t\n\nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site.  This team is trained to the Hazardous Materials Responder-Technician response capability in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 (q).  The team is capable of af"
