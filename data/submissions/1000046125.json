This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Buena Park Cold Storage's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.        STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility utilizes ammonia for their refrigeration system. The system is defined as a closed loop system.  Approximately 15,094 of ammonia are contained in the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  During the down season, major maintenance issues are handled to ensure the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.        HAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined for each ammonia refrigeration process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the CalARP Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A realistic alternative release scenario was defined for each ammonia refrigeration process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located in the CalARP Compliance Workbook.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Buena Park Cold Storage has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results"

Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n?    There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n?    The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n?    Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\n\n\n\nThe history of Buena Park Cold Storage (i.e., no CalARP-applicable ammonia releases in the last five years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nExternal Events Analysis\n\nExternal Events Analysis information as required by CalARP 19 CCR 2745.7 (q):\n\n?    The types of natural and human caused external events were considered in the 2010 PHA as required by PHA Section 2760.2.\n\n?    The estimated magnitude or scope of external events were considered and ranked in the 2010 PHA according to the Consequence and Risk Ranking Matrix.  In addition, a Seismic Assessment was performed for the facility in 2010. \n\n \n\nFor each external event, with a potential to create a release of a regulated substance that will reach an endpoint offsite, the following was applied in the 2010 PHA:\n\n?    The expected date of completion of any changes resulting from the PHA;\n\n?    Major hazards identified;\n\n?    Process controls in use;\n\n?    Mitigation systems in use;\n\n?

EXTERNAL EVENTS ASSESSMENT\n\nPursuant to the requirements of California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Section 2745.7 (q), general events external to the plant that can conceivably cause a release of ammonia were addressed by the PHA.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7.
