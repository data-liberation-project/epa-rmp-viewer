      "SummaryText": "Gillam & Mason, Inc. Is an agricultural retail outlet which sells chemicals and fertilizer in addition to irrigation equipment and parts.  The anhydrous ammonia is used in blending of liquid fertilizer.  Direct application is no longer utilized; therefore no tank transfers take place.  Handling is limited to receiving tanker loads & use in manufacturing only.\n\nThe maximum quanity of ammonia stored here at any one time is 47,700 lbs.\n\nWe have an emergency plan in case it is needed but we would rather practice saftey and have mechanisms in place so as to avoid ever having to use our emergency plan.\n\nWe believe emergencies can be prevented by having trained personnel.  Our people are trained to handle ammonia properly.  Safety equipment is provided and is religously used.  Equipment is maintained.  Defective parts are replaced immediately, we do not try to get by with questionable equipment.  Employees are encouraged to talk, practice and think safety.\n\nIn case there is a leak, rupture or complete escape of the anhydrous ammonia the first thing to do is evacuate everyone from the immediate area, that is, everyone within 800 yards of the facility.  If it is a worse case release scenario evacuation of people within 2.9 miles, downwind of the facility, will be given next priority.  Additional evacuation will be done on a need to basis depending on the extent and severity of the spill.  Every effort will be made to inform as many people in the vicinity as possible.  Assembly points are at the Fire Department southeast of the facility and The Amanda S. Cherry Center to the west, depending on wind direction.\n\nIn the meantime the Director of Emergency Services in Winton (Phone 252-358-7861) will be notified by dispatch and Harrellsville Fire Department (911) will be contacted.  Both of these departments have our emergency response plan and Risk Management Program.\n\nOnce everyone has been notified and evacuated we would approach the scene of the accident from upwind.

      "SummaryText": "r would be applied through a fog-nozzle to the point of the ammonia leak.  We would be cautious not to apply water to the tank unless it is being heated by a nearby fire.  Valves are then closed between the tank and the leak.  This is done by one or two men with self-contained breathing equipment and protective clothing going in under cover of water fog.  A safety line would be used.  If the leak cannot be controlled by closing the valves we would continue to put water on the discharge point.\n\nAs far as first aid and health aspects of a leak are concerned, we have made everyone aware that water is the best emergency first aid treatment for ammonia burns.  The importance of time is stressed.  Water needs to be applied to the injured area of the skin or eyes immediately.  Exposed areas need to be flushed or irrigated for at least 15 minutes.  No salves, ointments or oils should be applied to the burn for at least 24 hours.  Contaiminated clothing should be removed as soon as possible.  Because of the freezing action of anhydrous ammonia, clothing may be frozen to the skin, in which case the clothing would be thawed first.  The victim should be kept warm and a doctor called.  If the victim stops breathing, artificial respiration would begin."
