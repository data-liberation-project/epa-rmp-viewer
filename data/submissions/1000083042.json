Ethane is separated from the mixture and sent to a customer for use in their fuel system.  Propane is separated from the mixture and sent to a customer for sale as product.  Propylene is further purified and stored in an underground cavern.  \n\n\n\nThis site has two splitter column process trains with associated feed and recovery systems.  All aspects of the Prevention Program apply to all process areas of the facility. ",

We have developed and implement programs to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment, including those that satisfy Braskem's corporate standards and applicable government requirements.  Braskem's programs satisfy or exceed all applicable requirements under both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP). In order to ensure that our programs remain fully compliant, we periodically re-validate our Process Hazard Analyses (\"PHAs\") for covered processes to ensure that process hazards remain properly identified, understood, and adequately mitigated.  We also utilize these PHA revalidations to identify opportunities for further safety enhancements as needed. Braskem also conducts periodic compliance audits to ensure maintenance of administrative policies and mitigation controls to help prevent accidents and releases. The facility manager retains primary responsibility for safe operation of the facility.  In addition, all employees participate in safety related teams, projects, audits, and other activities and are trained to adhere to established policies and procedures. In addition, the Marcus Hook facility has a dedicated Emergency Response Team, consisting of fully trained members.  An Emergency Response Team is available during each shift.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Braskem Marcus Hook facility manufactures polypropylene, used in many common household items and packaging containers.

The site is equipped with a railcar storage area, where railcars containing raw material or finished product are kept prior to entering or exiting the facility. The raw material is subsequently processed in the Splitters separation area, and the resultant product is stored in the Cavern storage area. The purified ethane and propane streams are sold as products. The Facility combines the purified propylene stream with other raw materials, including hydrogen and triethyl aluminum, to produce polypropylene. The polypropylene, in the form of small pellets, is inert, non-toxic, non-hazardous, and not flammable. \n\n\n\nThe facility maintains inventories of propylene, propane, ethane, propyne, and propadiene in quantities exceeding the 10,000 lb threshold for each constituent under the EPA RMP program. The facility does not maintain inventories of any other material in excess of its applicable EPA RMP threshold. The facility's RMP program addresses propylene, propane, ethane, propyne, and propadiene. These materials are flammable and potentially explosive if mixed with air in sufficient concentration. The facility handles these materials under pressure in both gaseous and liquid forms.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe elements of the facility's Risk Management and Process Safety Management programs are distributed among site personnel, coordinated by the Facility Manager and Lead Engineer. Facility employees participate as members of PHA teams, management of change (MOC) reviews, Pre- Start Up Safety Reviews (PSSRs), incident investigations, and similar activities.
