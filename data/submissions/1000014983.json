      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Poet Biorefining-Jewell, facility (formerly Horizon Ethanol) is located approximately one mile northwest of Jewell, IA in Hamilton County.  The main product of the Poet Biorefining-Jewell facility is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in March 2006.  Poet Biorefining-Jewell produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and digestive enzymes to produce starch.  The resulting mash is converted to fermentable sugars. The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 20% alcohol by volume and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 1,500,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is normally stored in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 127,000 gallons (approximately 800,000 pounds), and may potentially be stored in Tank 802 (250,000 gallons, approximately 1,600,000 pounds).  NGC is blended with the 200-proof ethanol via in-line blending and shipped from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER THE EPA CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical present at Poet Biorefining-Jewell which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tanks, and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping (since installation of in-line blending in May 2010, the two 1,500,000 gallon storage tanks no longer contain denatured ethanol).  The denaturant is added to the ethanol t"

The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the maximum capacity of the alternate denaturant storage tank (1,600,000 pounds), located in the center containment area of the tank farm.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY AND PROGRAM\nPOET Biorefining-Jewell is committed to the protection of it employees, the surrounding community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process.  In the event of an emergency, the POET Biofefing-Jewell Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of POET Biofefing-Jewell to notify the Jewell Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nPOET Biofefing-Jewell is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate.  Some of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property, and a general computer based alarm system.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel"

All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe facility has an excellent record with regard to minimizing recordable and reportable accidents.  There have been no accidents since startup of the plant in March 2006 which require inclusion in the five-year accident history required by Subpart B of the CAPP/RMP regulation. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe POET Biofefing-Jewell management team is committed to an on-going system of reviewing changes in available technologies and any previous plant incidents to identify opportunities to improve plant safety.  Planned changes to improve plant safety include building job plans that include hazard identification for all job tasks.  Implementation of a world class mechanical integrity program including reliability root cause analysis will drive to a safer work environment also. \n"
