This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To save lives.\r\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3. To protect the environment.\r\n4. To minimize property damage\r\n\r\nCity of Burbank maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\r\n\r\nCity of Burbank has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department.

The water treatment system uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water.  Chlorination of the water kills the germs that cause such devastating diseases as cholera, typhoid fever, dysentery diseases that have practically disappeared since water chlorination has been extensively practiced.  The chlorine is delivered to the facility in one-ton containers.  Gaseous chlorine stored in one-ton containers in the chlorine storage room is metered and added to potable supply water in the chlorine feed room using two chlorinators and two injectors, respectively.  The resulting chlorine solution is added to the influent groundwater in a diffuser vault prior to the five million gallon reservoir (forebay) for primary disinfection.  The forebay is used to provide the required chlorine contact time for primary disinfection by free chlorination.\r\n\r\nIn the chlorine storage room at the  Valley Pumping Plant, two one-ton chlorine containers are maintained on-line.  A vacuum regulator-check unit switchover valve allows only one of the containers to feed chlorine at a time. When the switchover valve detects high vacuum from one of the containers, it opens to supply chlorine from the other container. All empty tanks connected to the manifold are replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by City of Burbank operators using a monorail hoist.\r\n\r\nThe Valley Pumping Plant chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  While connected to the system, two ton container are placed on a scale to allow City of Burbank operators to plan the change out procedure.  The one ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.

The chlorinators are equipped with rotameters to control the flow of the chlorine gas.  After the chlorinator, the chlorine is injected (by the injector) into the water line to create a chlorine solution.\r\n\r\nDetectors in the storage and feed rooms indicate chlorine gas leaks.  The disinfection building is also equipped with an automatic emergency chlorine scrubber system that is capable of neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor (the equivalent of a complete one-ton container failure with an average 20 percent flash-off rate).\r\n\r\nChlorine System:\r\n\r\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are three mechanisms in the plant to minimize the impact:  1) chlorine sensors/detectors, 2) alarms, and 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The chlorine sensors that trigger audible and visual alarms at a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm are located in the chlorine storage room and the chlorinator room.  Once a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm is detected by the sensors, the chlorine scrubber system is activated which neutralizes gaseous chlorine in the room resulting in a lower chlorine concentration, and an off-site alarm company will alert the local fire department via telephone.\r\n\r\nThe emergency chlorine scrubber is located outside and east of the chlorine storage room.  The system is designed to achieve a flow rate of 3,000 cubic feet per minute and is capable of completely neutralizing more than 400 pounds of chlorine vapor on a once-through basis (equivalent to a complete ton container failure with an average 20% flash off rate).

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a chlorine or ammonia release.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a near miss incident that occurred at 9:30 AM on January 5, 2020, when a Water Plant Operator (WPO) was alerted to chemical detection alarms for the Anhydrous Ammonia feed system at the Valley Plant. WPO quickly checked the alarm keypad and SCADA and found the system had activated at Stage 1 and Stage 2, however no ammonia was apparent in the environment (air) outside the room, and WPO advised the alarm was false. The Burbank Fire Department responded to the Valley Plant, and although they were aware the alarm was called off, they wanted to use the opportunity to become more familiar with the Valley Plant. A Senior Water Plant Mechanic arrived at 11:00 AM to troubleshoot, clean, and calibrate the Ammonia vent gas detector. The Senior Mechanic reported some dust had collected on the sensor; he cleaned, calibrated, and placed the Ammonia vent gas detector back in service that afternoon. There were no injuries that resulted due to this near miss. Recommendations resulting from the incident included modifying existing gas detectors to utilize full capabilities of the machines, improving existing documentation for SOPs, P&IDs, and the Maintenance Program, and improving the training program regarding RMP familiarization, Operations, and Emergency Respon"

There are three fuse plugs on each end of the one-ton containers for a total of six.  They are designed to melt, relieving pressure, in the event that the temperature reaches 156-164oF.\r\n\r\nAmmonia System:\r\n\r\nThe Valley Pumping Plant is designed to safely and efficiently treat groundwater.   The ammonia system process takes place in several rooms.  The ammonia storage room safety device consists of a leak detector on the interior wall, a panic button on the interior wall at each exit, and an alarm panel.  The ammonia feed room has a leak detector on the interior wall, and an alarm panel.\r\n\r\nThe disinfection facility is equipped with an alarm and monitoring system intended to minimize potential releases of chlorine and ammonia.  There are several types of equipment status indicators throughout the facility: pressure, temperature, level, vacuum, etc.  These indicators monitor the status of the different devices.  Some status indicators send an alarm to the control panel, others trigger another device to start up or shut off, and some are remote indicators that are monitored on a routine basis during operations.\r\n\r\nThree (3) ammonia leak detectors are operated on 120-volt AC, 60 Hz, 5A power supply.
