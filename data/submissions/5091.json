This process occurs in a contained area utilizing a steel flooring surrounded by steel flange dikes/lips comprising a \"pan\" container.  This is backed by concrete dikes.  Fuel is stored within this production area in seven separate blending tanks which are surrounded by a containment.     All containers are grounded; all motors are spark-free and all tools non-sparking.                          \n>  As received and processed, wastes may contain several of the materials listed for toxicity under Table 1 to Sec. 68.130.   However, none are contained on arrival or held in process in quantities equal to or exceeding the listed threshold quantity.   \n>  PROCESS :   Rineco blends liquid fuels that fall within the NFPA 4 rating.   As there may be presence of several of the listed chemicals present during processing, the \"Flammable Mixture\" was reported.  Under table 4 to Sec. 68.130, only Vinyl Chloride was received in the year of 1998.     Vinyl Chloride is held to <0.1% by weight in incoming materials.  2400 lbs. total was recorded for 1998.  Therefore the Rineco  RMP submission is for PROCESS 1\n>  The total weights of incoming waste were determined for the year of 1998.  This total wt. was used as though it was present in one quantity to calculate and report the RMP. Only Vinyl Chloride was registered as present in the flammable liquid mixture.\n>  Rineco has had NO reportable releases or incidents in the past 5 years.Under table 4 to Sec. 68.130 \n>  Rineco maintains a Health and Safety Program; a Hazardous Materials Response Program; and a Contingency Plan for major incident.  All are continuously supported with training, both classroom and OJT, and continuing review and update.\n>  Rineco maintains monitoring programs for VOC, air release, leak, spill and firepreventative measures, inclusive of document"
