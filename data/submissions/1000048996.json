The quantity is limited by capacity by automatic and manual systems to 40% of the tank's capacity; this is the inventory reported in the Section 1.17.   Ammonia is reacted with natural gas and air in the presence of a platinum gauze to produce HCN.  It is also used in various neutralization processes around the plant.\r\n\r\nHydrogen Cyanide\r\nHCN is produced by the catalytic reaction of ammonia, natural gas and air over a platinum gauze.  It is stored as a refrigerated liquid in two separate, non-connected, widely-separated stainless steel tanks. One tank belongs to the N3 process and one to the N5 process. Since these tanks are in separate, discrete processes, they are listed as two different processes in the plan. The release scenarios are identical as well as management systems which cover both Acetone Cyanohydrin N3 and Acetone Cyanohydrin N5. Normal inventory is limited to 60% of each tank's capacity. This was the inventory reported in the Section 1.17. The HCN is used as an intermediate in the production of methacrylic acid and its esters, methyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate.  \r\n\r\nChlorine\r\nChlorine is used in our Battleground Water facility to sanitize process water.  The chlorine is stored and used in one ton cylinders. Only two cylinders at a time are valved into the process.  \r\n\r\nFlammable Chemicals:\r\n\r\nPropylene\r\nLiquid propylene is received into the plant via pipeline, and there are no storage tanks.  There are two long, interconnected pipelines from the metering station to the process units.  The total quantity reported in Section 1.17 is the volume contained in both pipelines and in the vaporizers.

The following notes about these scenarios include information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals:\r\n\r\nAmmonia\r\nThe inventory of the tank is limited to 40% of capacity by automatic level controls and the operating procedures.  The worst case for ammonia is the release of the entire tank inventory in 10 minutes.  This will result in a liquid spill and vaporization and will produce a cloud that does have offsite residential impact. This scenario is unlikely because the tank has 1.5 thick steel walls, is made of stress relieved carbon steel, and is inspected periodically.\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals:\r\n\r\nAmmonia\r\nThere are two alternate case scenarios for the site. The first alternate ammonia scenario is a 1.5 hole in the line.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.  For the alternative scenario, the Rohm and Haas emergency response system will allow mitigation to begin within 10 minutes.  There are remote manual valves available to isolate the release.  The pipelines downstream of the ammonia storage tank are equipped with excess flow valves.  Fire monitors are available for water curtain in most areas of the plant. The second alternate scenario results from a 2 line break of an over head pipeline containing vaporized ammonia running from the ammonia tank to a boiler in which the ammonia is combusted. The Rohm and Haas emergency response system will allow mitigation to begin within 30 minutes. This will produce a cloud that"

Flooding is also covered in this plan.\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nAmmonia:  Most of the ammonia piping is all-welded carbon steel from the metering station to the unit. There are two tanks capable of storing ammonia, but only one is in service at any time. The tanks are made from carbon steel and are stress-relieved.  There are excess-flow check valves in the tank outlets and in the line from the tank to the north end of the plant.  These valves will slam shut on major flow increases which would occur upon line rupture or significant leaks.\r\n\r\nHydrogen Cyanide: Where flanges are required, we use 300# flanges and spiral-wound gaskets for maximum integrity.  Pumps for 100% HCN are canned motor pumps which have no seals, and leaks are highly unlikely.  HCN detectors are mounted at strategic locations throughout the unit, and provide an excellent warning system.  There are evacuation procedures at each HCN unit which are tested and drilled.\r\n\r\nChlorine:  The chlorine system feed piping uses a vacuum delivery system.

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\r\n\r\n- Process safety information - All of our processes have comprehensive information that is used to guide the choice of process and control technologies, operating parameters, and inspection intervals for equipment such as pipes, vessels, and protective systems.\r\n\r\n- Process hazard analysis - All processes have been subjected to a rigorous analysis. These PHAs were used to define the scenarios used in this report. The accident scenarios found in PHAs form the basis of additional analyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to protect both our employees and our neighbors.   They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.  \r\n\r\n- Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble shooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas.

Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system.\r\n\r\n- Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified process is built as intended.  It is the completion of hazard analysis to ensure that the analyses conducted are, indeed applicable to the process as built.  PSSRs are part of the institutionalized MOC and PHA systems.\r\n\r\n- Compliance audits - Several types of compliance and management system audits are performed.  RMP/PSM self-audits are performed every three years. Actions needed are entered into a computer-based action tracking system that automatically tells those responsible if completion of action items is taking longer than anticipated, so that remedial steps may be taken. In addition, annual self-assessments are performed on different elements of process safety.\r\n\r\n- Incident investigation - We also pioneered process safety incident investigations using multiple-cause, system-oriented techniques.  Many technical papers and presentations came from this work.  We continue to investigate process incidents using this technique and other root cause analysis tools so that we can gain all the information from each incident that we can to determine the root cause(s), in order to prevent future incidents and to add to the body of information about each process.\r\n\r\n- Employee participation - Employees participate in all aspects of the prevention program.

The buried pipe is coated and wrapped and is cathodically protected.   The propylene piping is designed for high pressure and normally operates at less than 20% of the design pressure.  The extra capability gives us an inherently safer means of being prepared for pressure surges, but there are also relief valves in the system to prevent damage to the pipelines.  There are remotely-operated isolation valves in the line to allow isolation of a segment in the event of a  leak.  These valves will shut automatically if a line rupture or significant leaks occurs.  There are vehicle barricades to protect above-ground parts of the line.  There is no tank, so the only inventory is in the lines themselves.
