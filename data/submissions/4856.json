This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances. The Lilly Technology Center has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.

A primary goal of the LEPC is to protect local citizens by developing and maintaining a coordinated emergency response plan and working with industry to minimize the impacts of chemical hazards.  Through the LEPC, citizens can obtain information about hazardous substances handled at local facilities and about emergency planning efforts designed to successfully cope with accidents if they occur.  The LEPC maintains a coordinated emergency response plan for the community detailing operational procedures to be followed in the event of an accident involving hazardous materials.  The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center actively supports local community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues. Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative evening programs for nearby neighbors.\n\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:\n\nEli Lilly produces a variety of pharmaceutical products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. The Lilly LTC Site, which is comprised of 225 acres, is bound by Morris Street on the North, Harding Street on the West and Raymond Street on the South.  LTC North was originally opened in 1946 and LTC South in 1968.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemical - Chlorine \n\nLilly uses chlorine to feed a caustic scrubber system for the insulin process. The worst case scenario is a puncture hole that releases the entire cylinder as a gas in 10 minutes.. According to the EPA RMP Comp and EPA's standard weather conditions, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.3 miles. Approximately 1,775 residents may be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario with the use of a chlorine B kit.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Chlorine\n\nThis scenario is similar to our worst case scenario and assumes a one ton chlorine cylinder with a release time of 18 minutes. According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) model using typical weather conditions for Indianapolis, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.6 miles. Approximately 2200 residents may be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario with the use of a chlorine B kit. In most cases other than during the storage and handling of the cylinder, the chlorine is stored in an enclosed building designed to scrub and contain the chlorine from releasing to the environment.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nLilly uses anhydrous ammonia in the insulin fermentation process.

According to the CHARM (Complex Hazardous Air Release Model) model using typical weather conditions for Indianapolis, the distance to the toxic end point is 1.0 mile. Approximately 1700 residents may be affected by this release. The Site emergency response team has trained on the mitigation of this scenario. In determining worse case offsite impacts, the RMP regulations assume that all safety systems must fail. In reality our restricted flow valves and the water deluge system for both the ammonia tank and the delivery truck should keep ammonia from going offsite.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nLilly LTC has no flammable chemicals that meet the regulatory criteria.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nLilly LTC has no flammable chemicals that meet the regulatory criteria.\n\n4. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS: \n\nThe Lilly Technology Center is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements, as well as other OSHA requirements.  The facility is also subject to regulation by other agencies, including the Indiana Department of Environmental Management and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. \n\nSpecific prevention programs include conducting pre-startup and design hazard assessments, proactive maintenance programs, routine vessel inspections, emergency response training, safe to work programs, employee and contractor safety programs, and accident investigation programs.\n\nAs a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), Lilly participates in a program known as Responsible Care . . The purpose of Responsible Care . is to commit companies to performance improvement in health, safety, and environmental quality.

All Lilly sites regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (Indiana and Puerto Rico sites) participate in this national program. Similar programs have also been initiated in European and Canadian plants.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: \n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. Based upon the criteria in EPA's RMP rule, we have had no chemical releases of these three chemicals during the past five years.\n\n6. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nEMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AT LILLY TECHNOLOGY CENTER\nThe Lilly Technology Center emergency response plan is linked to the plans of the Marion County Emergency Planning Committee. The site's response is coordinated by plant security using the plant's emergency response teams and equipment. The emergency response plan spells out the \"hows\" of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams. It includes response procedures for each building/area of the plant. Regular drills test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents. The emergency response plan has been written based on the \"one-plan\" EPA guidance and covers all topics based on that guidance. \n\nCOMMUNITY ALERT NETWORK (CAN) SYSTEM\nThe Lilly Technology Center has implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996.

These trainers attend and receive certification from the best emergency response schools in the country. On site training facilities and simulators facilitate the training process. In an emergency situation, one of the site emergency coordinators or his designate becomes the incident commander. The emergency response staff has the responsibility for maintaining the emergency response equipment. Vehicles on site include an ambulance, a command van, a response trailer, a hazardous materials response truck, a rescue truck and an on site medical facility.\n\no HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (HAZMAT) TEAM\n-Team members are employees who hold full-time jobs in other parts of the plant. Around 110 people from various work shifts make up the team.\n-Professionally-trained responders are always on site, and all responders wear pagers when not at work.\n-Hazardous material response includes responding to hazardous spills or vapor releases.
