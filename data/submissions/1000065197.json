              "Description": "E.W. Brown Generating Station is committed to making accident prevention a priority. Management and employees make safe operations and accident prevention the way of doing business everyday. For example, process safety information is discussed routinely. Written follow-up reports from meetings help to ensure on-going safety. A process hazard analysis has been conducted for these processes and findings have been documented, reviewed, and where needed, acted upon to ensure that procedures or design systems are modified to maintain a safe operation. New operators are trained on the operating procedures, health and safety issues, emergency operations, and applicable safe work practices. In addition to operator training, all personnel have been involved in awareness training, which reinforces the importance of safety at the facility. The engineering firm designing this system has provided manufacturer information which, when entered into KU's computerized maintenance management program, allows for tracking and accountability. The preventative maintenance program helps prevent maintenance issues. A management of change procedure, which prevents substitution of parts, is part of prevention. All employees are aware of the hazards when substituting parts of the wrong specification, which can lead to a serious ammonia release. Compliance audits and incident investigations are conducted as required. Employees are encouraged to participate in the safety process, which includes process reviews, training, and procedure writing. Contractors are selected based on previous safety performance and practices. In summary, the E.W. Brown Station and its employees are committed to a safe operation of their facility to prevent the release of ammonia that could endanger personnel, public, and the environment.",

Compliance audits and incident investigations are conducted as required. Employees are encouraged to participate in the safety process, which includes process reviews, training, and procedure writing. Contractors are selected based on previous safety performance and practices. In summary, the E.W. Brown Station and its employees are committed to a safe operation of their facility to prevent the release of ammonia that could endanger personnel, public, and the environment.",

              "Description": "E.W. Brown Generating Station is committed to making accident prevention a priority. Management and employees make safe operations and accident prevention the way of doing business everyday. For example, process safety information is discussed routinely. Written follow-up reports from meetings help to ensure on-going safety. A process hazard analysis has been conducted for these processes and findings have been documented, reviewed, and where needed, acted upon to ensure that procedures or design systems are modified to maintain a safe operation. New operators are trained on the operating procedures, health and safety issues, emergency operations, and applicable safe work practices. In addition to operator training, all personnel have been involved in awareness training, which reinforces the importance of safety at the facility. The engineering firm designing this system has provided manufacturer information which, when entered into KU's computerized maintenance management program, allows for tracking and accountability. The preventative maintenance program helps prevent maintenance issues. A management of change procedure, which prevents substitution of parts, is part of prevention. All employees are aware of the hazards when substituting parts of the wrong specification, which can lead to a serious ammonia release. Compliance audits and incident investigations are conducted as required.

Inspections, maintenance and employee training are important components of our accident prevention program.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: The owners, management, and employees of E.W. Brown are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the materials. Should an accidental release occur, the facility has orientated the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The facility also has prepared an Emergency Response Plan that addresses response to incidents and evacuation.\n\n2. Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled: The primary activity at E.W. Brown is producing electricity from coal. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, stored, and used in a closed loop refrigeration system and a selective catalytic reduction system.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: E.W. Brown has implemented Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plan Prevention Programs to manage the use of its covered materials. These programs cover employee participation, process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, mechanical integrity, emergency response, compliance audits, hot work and other safe work practices, process safety information, management of change, prestart-up safety reviews, incident investigations, and trade secrets.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of covered materials at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program: The facility has a written Emergency Response Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 and"
