EARLING FEED STORE                       Executive summary                   ll] Facility policy,  The owners, management, and employees of Earling Feed Store are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia,  if an accidentalrelease should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, LEPC, and other authorities to midigate and minimize any release impact to people and environment.                                                                           2]The primary activity at the facility is to store anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers for direct application, as a crop nutrient. The maximum stored is 289,000 lbs.                                                                                  3]The worst case scenario would be the release of the largest storage tank over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum release would be 26,000 lbs wahich represents the volume of the largest  tank @ 85% capacity, as limited by design.  The distance endpoint of .14 mg/l will be approximately 2.9 miles                The alternative release scenario, a failure of transfer hose for 2 minutes, before the excess flow valve interacts...or the manual shut-off valve would stop the release.  The maximum quantity released would be 11,900 pounds.  The distance to end point @.14mg/l would be l.3 miles, other mitigation measures include riser breakaway.                                                                                                                                             4]This facility is in compliance with the provisions of Safty Requirements for the Storage & Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1, published by the American NationalStandards Institude, Inc. [ANSI]  and standards of OSHA 29CFR1910.111,\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" the ANSI standard  adapted by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-chapter 43 rule 43.6 [200] 'Standard for the storage and handling "
