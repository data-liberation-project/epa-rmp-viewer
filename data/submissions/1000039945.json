      "SummaryText": "Overview:\r\n\r\nGlaxoSmithKline Vaccines, NA (GSK) operates a pharmaceutical manufacturing and Research & Development facility in Hamilton, Montana. This facility manufactures monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) powder for use in vaccines elsewhere. The manufacturing operations at the site consist of raw materials storage; process unit operations, including extraction, evaporation, acid and base hydrolysis, purification and others; and waste storage. The manufacturing processes use chloroform (CAS # 67-66-3) which is a regulated toxic substance under the Part 68 regulations, with a threshold quantity of 20,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nPolicies:\r\n\r\nThe GSK facility is regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and utilizes Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Therefore, maintenance activities are performed frequently and the site is under constant supervision. If a maintenance issue is discovered that could potentially result in a spill, it is corrected promptly. GSK also has both a comprehensive Emergency Notification and Evacuation Procedure and a Spill Response Plan.\r\n\r\nRegulated substance:\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing processes at the Hamilton facility use chloroform. The largest vessel that contains chloroform is a 10,000-gallon tank located indoors in Building 9. Waste liquid containing chloroform at a concentration of up to 33 percent (by volume) drains to this tank. Therefore, the tank can contain up to 41,019 pounds of chloroform in the waste liquid.\r\n\r\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\nGSK is regulated by OSHA under 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119, Clean Water Act Regulations under  40 CFR 112, RCRA Regulations under 40 CFR 264 and 265, and State EPCRA Rules or Laws.\r\n\r\nThe areas where chemicals are stored are inspected frequently. GSK has tank level, overfill, and leak detection alarms and other indicators that alert site personnel of situations which require response. The site is under constant supervision and main"

      "SummaryText": "tenance activities are performed frequently. Specific operating and maintenance procedures include frequent inspection of all chemical storage vessels, process vessels, and related fittings (pumps, valves, and piping). \r\n\r\nGSK personnel are trained to recognize the potential for spill hazards. When spill hazards are discovered, GSK personnel mitigate them to prevent spills.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:\r\n\r\nGSK has not had an accidental release within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n \r\nEmergency response program:\r\n\r\nThe GSK facility has a trained Emergency Response Team (ERT) to respond to various emergencies on site. The ERT includes members trained to respond to medical emergencies and chemical spills. Spill responders are trained initially (24-hour HAZWOPER) and receive an annual 8-hour HAZWOPER refresher training. Medical responders are trained to perform First Aid and CPR.\r\n\r\nGSK has the following equipment available on site to respond to emergencies:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tCommunication Equipment & Alarms\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Containment and Control Equipment & Tools\r\n\u00bf\tSpilled Material Storage Containers\r\n\u00bf\tProtective Clothing and Respirators\r\n\u00bf\tFirst Aid Kits\r\n\u00bf\tDecontamination Equipment\r\n\u00bf\tFire Extinguishing Systems\r\n\r\nIn the event that a spill cannot be managed by GSK's on-site personnel, GSK would call in its spill response contractor to handle the containment and cleanup. GSK has developed both a comprehensive Spill Response Procedure and an Emergency Notification and Evacuation Procedure to coordinate with the local emergency responders and also to notify the Local, State, and Federal emergency response contacts.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nGSK has not had a release within the past 5 years. Upon the discovery of a deficiency in the facility's existing plans leading to a spill, GSK would take action to review and revise its existing plans if the incident could have been prevented. If new regulations require additional safety plans or procedures, GSK will implement them promptly. GS"
