If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any releases and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilzers for sale to farmer.  Anhydrous ammoina is recieved, stored and transfered for use as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity handled would be the 262,140# stored in our storage tanks.  We also have the potential for 65,535# in rolling stock.  This gives us a total of 327,675#.\n\nTher worst case release scenario and the alternate case scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  All important information will be forwarded to the local first responders.  \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61/1\" and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet the current underwriting guidelines of our Insurance and undergo annual loss control surveys based on both physical property and safety/operational procedures.  NOTE:  The Kansas Department of Agriculture has not yet adopted the most recent ANSI standard.  Our company realizes the importance of keeping current with the standards and will do our best to budget any needed time and money to bring facilities up to the current code.\n\nOur firm has an outstanding safety record at this location.  In the past five years we have had no reportable accidents nor to our knowledge have we had any off-site deaths, injuries, sheltering in place, evacuations or environmental damage.  \n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan that, in the event of a major release, requires employees to notify ot"
