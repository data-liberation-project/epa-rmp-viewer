              "Description": "RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe prevention program for the rail car cleaning process is described below.\n\n\n\nIn December 1995, GATC (now GATX) performed a hazard and operability (HAZOP) process hazard analysis (PHA) in order to identify potential hazards at the facility.  This HAZOP was revalidated in May 2014. GATX has several process controls in use such as relief valves, check valves, flares, manual and automatic shutoffs and alarms, and procedures in the event of a release.  Additionally, a hose inspection and replacement policy is in place to further minimize the likelihood of a release.\n\n\n\nGATX has developed a set of operating procedures contained in the GATX Car Cleaning Procedures Manual.  The Manual documents procedures for acceptance, inspection and sampling of incoming railcars, and provides the documentation for operating the rail car cleaning system.  These procedures are reviewed on an annual basis to maintain current and accurate instructions.  \n\n\n\nGATX has procedures in place to conform to requirements established by the Process Safety Management rule.  Process Safety Management (PSM) is a system through which the company can manage hazards associated with processes involving highly hazardous chemicals (HHC's).  Employers that produce, use, store, transport, or handle these HHC's in amounts equal to or greater than the specified quantities fall under the PSM standard.  The GATX employee participation in this process is essential to a quality effort in eliminating potential workplace hazards and incidents.\n\n\n\nGATX has developed a training plan to attempt to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents both during normal operations and emergencies.  The procedures currently in place are designed to satisfy the requirements of 29 C.F.R. 1910.119 and OSHA PSM regulations.  They will also satisfy the requirements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations. \n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. This includes preventive maintenance and inspection procedures, the frequency of such procedures, inspection responsibility, and guidance documents for these procedures.\n\n\n\nGATX has a Management of Change procedure in place.  GATX has implemented this procedure to help ensure that changes are properly reviewed and that hazards introduced by the implementation of change are identified and controlled prior to placing the change in operation.  \n\n\n\nGATX has implemented a pre-startup safety review to help ensure that certain important considerations have been addressed.  This helps ensure that adequate safety measures are in place and are operational and that other aspects of the PSM/RMP program are updated and implemented as needed.  This procedure, in conjunction with other PSM/RMP program elements, is intended to satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nCompliance audits are a crucial component of the RMP program and will provide management with information on the success of the program and on areas that need improvement.  Audits are conducted annually by the RMP Program to ensure that the procedures and practices developed under the RMP standards are followed.\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulation requires facilities experiencing an incident involving a covered process to follow prescribed incident investigation procedures.  The purpose of the RMP incident investigation requirement is to ensure that incidents involving regulated toxic substances are investigated; that recommendations for preventing a reoccurrence are identified and implemented; and, that appropriate personnel are briefed on the causes of the incident.\n\n\n\nGATX has instituted an employee participation plan in the PSM/RMP development for regulated hazardous processes.  The management has implemented this plan in an effort to ensure that employees potentially affected by process operations have knowledge of and access to information relative to the process.  This procedure is intended to outline the employee's participation/responsibilities within the scope of GATX's PSM/RMP program, and to satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nGATX has implemented a Contractor Safety Policy to insure that contractors comply with the Occupational Safety and Health requirements and implement an effective industrial safety program for work at the GATX facilities.",

This document focuses on operations at the Hearne, Texas facility (Facility). The Facility's operations include painting and sandblasting and railcar interior cleaning. Specialized equipment includes  a flare system for venting cars containing flammable gases.  These processes, specifically the venting operations, involve the use of the following regulated substances in excess of the TQ:\n\n\n\n?    10,948 pounds of Butadiene (which exceeds 10,000 pound Federal RMP and 10,000 pound PSM TQ)\n\n?    20,790 pounds  of Butane (which exceeds 10,000 pound Federal RMP and 10,000 pound PSM TQ)\n\n?    13,027 pounds of Isobutane (which exceeds 10,000 pound Federal RMP and 10,000 pound PSM TQ)\n\n?    25,423 pounds of Pentane (which exceeds 10,000 pound Federal RMP and 10,000 pound PSM TQ)\n\n?    21,165 pounds  of Propane (which exceeds 10,000 pound Federal RMP and 10,000 pound PSM TQ)\n\n?    18,578 pounds of Propylene (which exceeds 10,000 pound Federal RMP and 10,000 pound PSM TQ)    \n\n\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\n\n\nGATX is committed to managing and operating the facility in accordance with relevant  regulations and good operating practices.  These operating practices strive to minimize the risk of an accidental release of a regulated substance from the railcar cleaning process.  If an accidental release were to occur, GATX has response measures in place to minimize the release impact.\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS \n\n\n\nThe site-specific worst-case release scenario analysis is on file at the covered Facility.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO ANALYSIS  \n\n\n\nTh"

These procedures are reviewed on an annual basis to maintain current and accurate instructions.  \n\n\n\nGATX has procedures in place to conform to requirements established by the Process Safety Management rule.  Process Safety Management (PSM) is a system through which the company can manage hazards associated with processes involving highly hazardous chemicals (HHC's).  Employers that produce, use, store, transport, or handle these HHC's in amounts equal to or greater than the specified quantities fall under the PSM standard.  The GATX employee participation in this process is essential to a quality effort in eliminating potential workplace hazards and incidents.\n\n\n\nGATX has developed a training plan to attempt to ensure that employees are knowledgeable in facility operations and to reduce the risk of accidents both during normal operations and emergencies.  The procedures currently in place are designed to satisfy the requirements of 29 C.F.R. 1910.119 and OSHA PSM regulations.  They will also satisfy the requirements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations. \n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place to maintain "

GATX has implemented this procedure to help ensure that changes are properly reviewed and that hazards introduced by the implementation of change are identified and controlled prior to placing the change in operation.  \n\n\n\nGATX has implemented a pre-startup safety review to help ensure that certain important considerations have been addressed.  This helps ensure that adequate safety measures are in place and are operational and that other aspects of the PSM/RMP program are updated and implemented as needed.

The purpose of the RMP incident investigation requirement is to ensure that incidents involving regulated toxic substances are investigated; that recommendations for preventing a reoccurrence are identified and implemented; and, that appropriate personnel are briefed on the causes of the incident.\n\n\n\nGATX has instituted an employee participation plan in the PSM/RMP development for regulated hazardous processes.
