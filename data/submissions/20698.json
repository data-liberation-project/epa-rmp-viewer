General accidental release and prevention policy of Gorton's.\nGorton' is a frozen seafood processing facility that utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a\nrefrigerant. Anhydrous ammonia is considered extremely hazardous by the Environmental\nProtection Agency.\nThe same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to\nobserve certain safety precautions during it's use to prevent exposure to our workers,\nthe surrounding community and the environment.\nIt is our policy at Gorton's to implement the requirements of the Risk Management\nProgram by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable\nfederal and state regulations that we are governed by. The objective is to minimize the\nrisk of an accidental release of hazardous materials. Our plant personnel have been\ntrained on equipment operating procedures\nand various safety devices incorporated in our facility to prevent accidental releases. If\na situation arises beyond the capability of Gorton's personnel, their refrigeration\ncontractor, (Recco) is used\nas a response team with possible assistance from the State Hazardous Materials\nResponse Team.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled.\n\nGorton's, 127 Rogers Street, Gloucester, Massachusetts operates a refrigeration\nsystem utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant. Mechanical\nrefrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as\na heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed\nenvironment. The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression,\ncondensation and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the\nquantity of energy associated with the refrigerant. Compression and expansion are\ndesigned to\nchange the availability of the associated energy. The refr"

      "SummaryText": "igeration cycle is a closed\nloop process. The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of\nvaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat\nfrom a desired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area\nwhere it is of no consequence.\n\nGorton's facility adjoins an Americold Cold Storage facility that receives finished\nproduct from Gorton's.  The refrigeration system is actually a spilt system that is\noperated by Americold. Americold operates the machine room (compressors, condenser,\nreceivers) while Gorton's\noperates and maintains the low side of the system, (pump receivers, coil evaporators,\nwater chillers and coolers) to maintain processing, freezer and holding room\ntemperatures required for the processing and storage of our product. There are\napproximately 400 employees at this facility, including hourly and salary personnel,\nthat manufacture and prepare shipment of frozen seafood products via truck\napproximately 24 hours a day, five days a week.\n\nThe refrigeration system contains 40,000 pounds of aggregate ammonia. The potential\nhazards\nthat could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited\nto, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough ammonia is a colorless, tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is\nit's pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in\nareas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not normally result in\nany health risks. Risks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are\nirritations to the eyes, nose and throat. The extent of irritation depends on the\nexposure amount and length of time exposed.\nAmmonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will\nburn,\nbut only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with an ignition\nsource.\n\n3. Worst case  and alternate case release sce"
