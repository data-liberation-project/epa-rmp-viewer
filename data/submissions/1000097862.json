The facility management ensures that facility personnel continue to adhere to these safety procedures.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled: Global Tungsten and Powders Corp. (GTP) is located in Towanda, PA in the Northeastern corner of the state. GTP's primary emphasis is the manufacturing of tungsten and molybdenum powders with additional emphasis on other specialty products. \n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7), and the corresponding regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, because of the on-site storage of hydrogen and aqueous ammonia.  \n\n\n\nThe hydrogen storage operations comply with Prevention Program 3 of the Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\"), and the aqueous ammonia operations comply with the Prevention Program 2. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: The facility has developed and instituted procedures to prevent and effectively respond to any accidental releases from the processes.  These procedures were developed in accordance with both the OSHA PSM standards in 29 C.F.R. 1910.119 and RMP 40 C.F.R. Part 68 requirements. \n\n\n\nThe facility regularly trains personnel who are responsible for operating and maintaining the processes, both in the classroom and on the job.  \n\n\n\nAn outside supplier who incorporates safe procedures maintains the hydrogen storage and supply system.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History: The facility has had no RMP-reportable accidents of hydrogen and aqueous ammonia since the submission of the last RMP.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program: The facility has an existing emergency response plan that contains emergency response and coordination procedures for releases from the hydrogen and aqueous ammonia processes.  This plan coordinates emergency response effort"

      "SummaryText": "s with the local fire department and local emergency planning commission. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: The facility periodically reviews the program, training and maintenance procedures to identify any necessary changes that would improve safety at the facility.  Pursuant to this review procedure, the facility recently completed the following items: The GTP facility continues to complete inspections using API 510 and 570 on the Ammonia Hydroxide Storage tanks and virgin Hydrogen piping. The last inspection of this kind took place in 2018.  The facility also recently converted the former anhydrous ammonia storage tanks to ammonium hydroxide storage tanks so anhydrous ammonia is no longer present at the site and as such has been removed from the RMP.  This has significantly lowered the risk to our workers and the surrounding community. \n\n"
