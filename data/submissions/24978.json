      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe PRC-DeSoto International, Inc. Mojave, CA facility complies with applicable California and US EPA regulations and applicable Department of Transportation requirements.  PRC-DeSoto also follows the Responsible Care (registered service mark) Code of Management Policies, including the Responsible Care (registered service mark) Community Awareness Code of Management Practices.  PRC-DeSoto International is a wholly owned subsidiary of PPG Industries and follows PPG's own Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy to assure emergency preparedness and foster community right-to-know.  PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.  All of these activities form an integral part of PPG's overall Environment, Health and Safety Policy, whose goal is \"to market, distribute, and manufacture products globally in a responsible manner that protects employees, neighbors, customers, and the environment.\"  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nPRC-DeSoto International Inc.'s Mojave, CA facility produces resins, adhesives and sealants used in the aerospace industry.  The facility stores and uses mixed isomers of Toluene 2, 4 Diisocyanate &Toluene 2, 6 Diisocyanate, both of which are referred to as TDI at levels at or above the Regulatory Threshold Planning Quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The facility does not store any other chemicals on the RMP list above the Federal Threshold Planning Quantity.   \n\nWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for the 2,4 & 2, 6 TDI mixed isomer materials at the facility.  EPA's ALOHA gaussian plume dispersion model was used to predict a release of the regulated compound using the largest container size in which the regulated compound is stored.  \n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be an"

Based on EPA RMP criteria, the worst case release scenario does not have offsite impact.\n\nBecause the worst case scenario has no off-site impact, no alternative case is required by the RMP regulation.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of TDI from the Mojave site in the past five years, which resulted in on-site or off-site impacts as defined by EPA's RMP criteria.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe RMP regulation specifies that covered processes at all plants must be classified as Program Level 1, 2 or 3 processes.  PRC-DeSoto International Inc.'s Mojave, CA TDI process is classified as Program Level 1 process because the Worst-Case Scenario has no off-site impact and because the TDI process had no accidental releases in the past five years that meet the RMP criteria.  Submission of specific prevention program information for Program Level 1 processes is not required in the RMP.\n\nEmergency Response Procedures\n\nPRC-DeSoto International Inc. coordinates emergency response activities (procedures, training, drills, etc.) with the local fire department.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPRC-DeSoto International Inc. is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  The commitment extends beyond production into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations.  Changes in the manufacturing equipment, operating practices and process controls are made, as necessary, to assure process reliability and effective minimization of accidental releases.
