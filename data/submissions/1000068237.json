Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nBarbasol is strongly committed to environmental compliance, employee and public health and safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.    Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures a variety of aerosol products.  Barbasol has 2 regulated substances above the 10,000 lbs threshold quantity at the facility, Isobutane and Propane, both flammable gases.  A mixture of 84.8% Isobutane and 15.2% Propane, called \"A-46\", is received at the facility in typical 31,000 USG size railcars and transferred to an 18,000 USG size storage tank.  The A-46 mixture of Isobutane and Propane is used as an aerosol propellant in Barbasol products.\n\n\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nBarbasol has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standards, 2004 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\n\n\n\nBarbasol maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\n\n\n\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular in"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\n\n\n\nTo ensure safe operations, Barbasol maintains detailed written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\n\n\n\nBarbasol has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\n\n\n\nBarbasol carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Inspected process equipment includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Barbasol to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\n\n\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routin"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\n\n\n\nBarbasol conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions identified as a result of the audits are systematically completed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\n\n\n\nBarbasol promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\n\n\n\nBarbasol truly believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, the employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87]\n\n\n\nContractors are occasionally hired to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out.  Barbasol has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n\n\n4.    Fi"
