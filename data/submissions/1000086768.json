The team's findings are forward to Blackwell' Management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nD. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nBlackwell maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management. The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee's suggestion, compliance audit, PHAs, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\n\n\n\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\n\n\nE. Training\n\n\n\nBlackwell has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process.

Management of Change\n\n\n\nBlackwell has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all Reported Covered Processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: \n\n\n\n1. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n\n2. Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the proposed change\n\n\n\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n\n\n\nK. Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nBlackwell will promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personal injury. The goal of each investigation will be to determine the facts and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team will document its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences, and forward these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations will be tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation will be documented and investigation reports will be retained for at least 5 years. \n\n\n\nL. Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nAt least every 3 years a Compliance Audit addressing OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of Blackwell. This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findi"

Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a description of existing features applicable to prevention of accidental release of regulated substances in this facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nBlackwell's accident release prevention and response policies are applied to all RMP-covered processes. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nN. Specialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nSite specific detection and control equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the plant to:\n\n\n\n1. Contain/control a release\n\n2. Quickly detect a release, and\n\n3. Reduce the consequences of an RMP-regulated substance release\n\n\n\nThe following type of safety features are used in the covered process: \n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n2. Automatic and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n3. Automatic plant shutdown system to shut down all engines, plant utilities and automatically operate all automatic valves to their fail-safe position, diverting all incoming gas to the emergency flare. \n\n4. Curing or diking to contain liquids releases\n\n5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation\n\n6. Atmospheric relief devices \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n\n\n1. Fire extinguishers only\n\n2. Trained emergency response personnel\n\n3. Personal protective equipment\n\n\n\nO. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nHAINESVILLE GAS PROCESSING PLANT Frac has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the past five years. \n\n\n\nP. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an acc"

Blackwell has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police, Sheriff's Office, or similar). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Blackwell conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel.\n\n\n\nQ. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nBlackwell's management is committed to the following:\n\n\n\n1. Preventing accidents;\n\n2. Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n3. Participating in community emergency preparedness;\n\n4. Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Blackwell operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the natural gas treatment and liquids recovery process. Most importantly, we stress our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."
