      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nDPC Enterprises (DPC) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is company policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations as well as implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDPC's emergency response program includes procedures for notification of the local fire department; notification of any potentially affected neighbors; and notification of local, state and federal agencies.   Safety is an essential part of facility operations as evidenced by the safety devices built-in to the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the extensive training of our personnel.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nDPC whose primary activities encompass distributing and repackaging inorganic chemicals and compressed gases as well as manufacturing water treatment products.\n \nWe handle Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) for use by our customers.\n\n3.    The Process Safety Management Program\nDPC facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  A number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at this stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDPC maintains a detailed record of safety information that de"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the Hazop/Checklist (combined).  The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated every five years as required or as necessary.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, DPC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDPC carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at DPC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

      "SummaryText": "rators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at DPC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDPC conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the PSM/RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDPC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDPC truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  DPC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards"

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.    Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of a regulated substance from this facility in the last five years.\n\n\n5.    Emergency Response Plan\nDPC maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nThe Jefferson County LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n6.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nDPC continues to participate in Chlorine Institute programs, and continuously works to improve our operations."
