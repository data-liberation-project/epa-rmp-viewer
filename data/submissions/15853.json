This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  Tetra's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Tetra Chemicals Facility is located in an agricultural area that borders West Memphis, Arkansas.  The Facility produces zinc/calcium bromide blends in water solutions that are used as high-density workover and completion fluids in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Facility personnel identified no listed flammable substances and two toxic regulated substances kept on site. The chemicals are Bromine and Formaldehyde.  The largest quantity on site and threshold quantity for Bromine is 260,000 lbs and 10,000 lbs, respectively.  The largest quantity on site and threshold quantity for Formaldehyde is 25,300 lbs and 15,000 lbs, respectively. \n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nThe listed substances, which are stored above threshold quantities at the West Memphis facility, are bromine and formaldehyde.  Based on worst-case analysis using urban conditions, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, the Facility is subject to OSHA PSM.  Therefore, the West Memphis facility meets the criteria of a Program 3 process under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) program.\n\n     Flammable Substances\n\nThe West Memphis facility does not ha"

The toxic endpoint for bromine is 0.0065 mg/L and 0.012 mg/L for formaldehyde.  The ARP Program requirement for toxics, in a worst-case scenario, assumes the total quantity is released in ten minutes.  \n\nA release of 130,500 lbs of bromine with a 16.56-miles distance-to-endpoint and a release of 506 lbs of formaldehyde with a 0.03-miles distance-to-endpoint are the worst-case toxic releases.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoints beyond the facility's fenceline.  Alternative release scenarios for flammable substances should have the potential to cause substantial damage, including onsite damage.\n\nThe following conditions may be considered for alternative release scenarios:\n\n7 Release rate dependent upon the scenario;\n7 Consideration of active and passive mitigation systems.\n    \nFlammable Substances\n\nThe West Memphis facility does not have any flammable substances above the threshold quantity; therefore, analysis of alternative release scenarios for flammable substances is not required.\n\nToxic Substances\n\nOne alternative release scenario for each toxic substance was conducted for the Facility under the Accidental Release Prevention program.  As with the worst-case release scenario, the alternative release scenario for the toxic substances utilizes the ERPG-2 to determine toxic endpoint.\n\nA hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for bromine and formalde"

The alternative scenario for formaldehyde is the puncturing of a drum by a forklift.  A ten gallon leak from the pierced drum is to be assumed.\n\n\nThe alternative-case releases of bromine and formaldehyde resulted in a 0.27-mile distance to its endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L and a 0.01-mile distance to its endpoint of 0.12 mg/L respectively.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the West Memphis facility. The processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard.  Therefore, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nThe Facility strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Hazardous Materials Team (HazMat Teams), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, \"near-miss\" reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe West"

Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The PSI will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process Safety Information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). The Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  \n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety feature"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  However, as situations warrant, the Facility will use other inductive techniques such as what if/checklist and or other techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  PHA team members include the process/project engineer responsible for the process/project; plant manager or knowledgeable plant person; person knowledgeable in methods of hazard analysis; and others with particular expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk matrix assigned by the PHA team.  The matrix is based on severity (criticality) and probability (frequency).  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the PHA team periodically updates and re"

The recommended order of analysis will be based upon the following criteria:\n\n1. age of process; \n2. extent of process hazards; \n3. number of affected employees; and,\n4. operating history of the process.  \n\nThe results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe West Memphis facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as the following:\n\n1. initial startup;\n2. normal operations; \n3. temporary operations; \n4. emergency shutdown; \n5. emergency operations; \n6. normal shutdown; \n7. startup following a turnaround; and,\n8. start up after emergency shutdown.  \n\nThese procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  \n\nOperating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review is to assure that the procedures reflect current operating practice, include changes from process technology changes, chemical changes, equipment changes, and changes to facilities.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful, and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent, and most importantly, communicated to employees.

New employees receive basic training in process operations and procedures. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  The appropriate frequency of training is based on management in consultation with the employees involved in operating the particular process.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe West Memphis facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors do the following:\n\n1. perform their work in a safe manner; \n2. have appropriate knowledge and skills; \n3. are aware of the hazards of their workplace;\n4. understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; \n5. understand and follow site specific safety rules; and \n6. inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers the following:\n\n1. a process overview; \n2. information about safety and health hazards including known or potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards;\n3. emergency response plan requirements; and \n4. safe work practices must be developed and implemented regarding control of entrance, presence and exit of contract personnel prior to beginning their work.\n\nIn addition, the Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

Plant personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe West Memphis facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment and highly hazardous chemicals into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\nThe PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  The PSSR also ensures that procedures (safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency) are in place and are adequate.  Prior to startup, the facility determines that a PHA has been conducted, recommendations resolved, and training of employees involved in the process is verified as part of the PSSR.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program includes the following:\n\n1. training; \n2. developing written procedures; \n3. performing inspections and tests consistent with good engineering practices; \n4. correcting equipment deficiencies outside acceptable PSI limits; and, \n5. applying quality assurance measures. \n\nIn combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on the following:\n\n1. an overview of the process, \n2. safety and health hazards, \n3. applicable maintenance procedures, \n4. emergency response plans and, \n5. applicable safe work practic"

The Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nSeveral actions are incorporated during construction of new processes or equipment to ensure these are suitable for the process application.  Checks and inspections are performed to assure that installation is consistent with design specifications and manufacturer's instructions suitable for the particular application.  The Facility has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include the following:\n\n1. control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel;\n2. a lockout/tag out procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance;\n3. a procedure for safe removal of hazardous and toxic substances before process piping and equipment is opened;\n4. a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work); and,\n5. a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  \n\nThese procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe West Memphis facility has a comprehensive system of written procedures to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, process equipment, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, impact to safety and health and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Prior to changes being made, they are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate"

In addition operating and maintenance personnel, including contractor employees, are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Facility promptly investigates (within 48 hours) all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The reports are maintained for five years.\n\nAn investigation team is established to investigate each process incident.  The team will consist of members involved in the incident including at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved; a contract employee (if the incident involved the work of a contractor); and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings in a report.  The report includes dates of the incident and investigation, description of incident, factors contributing to the incident, and develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.  \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the West Memphis facility periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members with at "

Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked and documented until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  The two most recent compliance audit reports are retained.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the West Memphis facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following sections include descriptions of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the RMP-covered process at the West Memphis facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and, (3) reduce the consequences (mitigate) of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the RMP covered process:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Sensors with audible alarms are located to detect and warn of leaks.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n1. Pressure relief valves on applicable tanks.\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.Standard operating procedures that control, isolate, and terminate leaks.\n2. Personnel trained in emergency procedures.\n3. Personal protective equipment (e.g., escape respirator, self-contained breathing apparatus, and supplied air breathing apparatus).\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe West Memphis facility has an excellent record of accident prevention over the past five years. There has been no incident involving a regulated substance."
