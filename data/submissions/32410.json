      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n1.0\tSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n1.1\tSOURCE\r\nThe Unilever Best Foods (UBF) Baltimore, Maryland margarine \r\nproduction facility is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program \r\n(RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it \r\nhas a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity \r\n(10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7).  \r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The \r\nanhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the \r\nprocessing and storage temperature for margarine and related products.  \r\nIt is a closed system that contains ammonia in various physical states (gas, \r\nliquid, and saturated vapor).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located \r\nindoors.  The condensing towers, main ammonia receiver, make-up air \r\nunits, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \r\nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \r\nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \r\npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \r\nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \r\npiping, and equipment.\r\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a \r\nhigh pressure side and a low pressure side.  The margarine processing \r\nunits (MPUs) operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly chill \r\nproduct on scrape surface heat exchangers.  Ammonia suction from the \r\nMPUs at about 0 psig passes through the low accumulator before entering \r\nthe booster compressors.  Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is \r\ntrapped in the low side accumulators and returned as high pressure liquid \r\nfor the system.  The booster discharge passes through an intercooler/high \r\nside suction before entering the high side compressors.\r\nThe high side compresso"

      "SummaryText": "r suction draws from the intercooler/high side \r\nsuction accumulator at about 30 psig (booster discharge).  This \r\naccumulator receives suction from various cooler units.  Excess ammonia \r\nliquid that collects in the high side accumulator is removed and return to \r\nthe system.\r\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to \r\nfive condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for \r\ndefrosting and for operation of the pumper drums.\r\nThe condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is \r\nfed to the low and high side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, \r\nand air handlers.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \r\nsafety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room \r\nventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the \r\ncompressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, \r\nintercooler, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with \r\noverpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high \r\ntemperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level \r\nfloats and sensors for vessels.  The high pressure cutouts for the \r\ncompressors are set at 200 psig.\r\n2.0\tPREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThe facility has carefully considered the potential for accidental releases of \r\nammonia, such as the occurrence of the worst-case and alternative-release \r\nscenarios described in Section 2.0.  To help minimize the probability and \r\nseverity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the \r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety \r\nManagement (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) \r\nhas been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program \r\nare summarized below:\r\n-\tThe development, documentation, and operator availability of critical \r\nprocess safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the \r\ndesign basis of the system, and the eq"
