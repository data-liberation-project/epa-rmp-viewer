Detection system activates visual alarms at the facility main control center to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak in the chiller system.\n* Ammonia detection is hard wired to chiller building ventilation system. Detection system will activate exhaust fans in the event of a detected ammonia release.\n* Refrigeration Control System monitors and controls compressors, condenser, vessels and ammonia pumps. System displays continual operational status of equipment and controls alarms / shutdowns for out of  parameter indications. \n* High level alarms and system shut offs are installed on pressure vessels. Abnormal operating levels sensed in the vessels will activate a shutdown of the compressors.\n* Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels to eliminate the potential for an over-pressure condition within the vessel and the refrigeration system. \nAmmonia detection sensor installed on safety relief valve vent stack will activate water deluge system to \"scrub\" ammonia vapor prior to release into the atmosphere in the event of a release.\n* Emergency \"stop\" button installed outside chiller building and in facility main control room to stop all ammonia refrigeration equipment and start exhaust fans in the event of a release.\n* Computerized \"MAXIMO\" preventative maintenance program is instituted within the maintenance department to ensure all refrigeration components are maintained in optimum operational and mechancal condition.\n* Continual vibration analysis of ammonia compressors is installed to alert maintenance personnel of potential equipment malfunction, or failure.\n* Rumford personel on-site 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Personel monitor system performance and make scheduled rounds to detect potential hazards or abnormal operation of the system.",
