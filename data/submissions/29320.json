The facility occupies 19 acres in a commercial/industrial area. The Niacet facility along with several other surrounding companies were all once owned by Union Carbide corporation. The facility is bordered by Niagara Falls Boulevard to the north,47th street to the west, and Simmons avenue to the south. The facility is bordered by a Praxair facility to the east. The nearest residential area is approximately 0.5 mi. To the NW. \n\nNiacet Corporation is a major producer of metal organic acid salts such as calcium propionate, sodium acetate, and sodium phenoxyacetate which is used in the fermentation of penicillin. Niacet produces monochloroacetic acid which is used in the manufacture of sodium phenoxyacetate,and also sold on the merchant market. Chlorine is used as a raw material in the production of monochloroacetic acid. Niacet uses ethyl ether in the manufacture of sodium phenoxyacetate and anionic surfactants.\n\nChlorine is received via railcar and transferred through a vaporizer into one of two 5,000 gal. chlorinators for the production of monochloroacetic acid. Niacet can have two 90 ton chlorine railcars on site for a total of 360,000 lbs. Safety systems include chlorine sensors, and automatic shut off valves.\nEthyl ether is received via tank truck. The ethyl ether is stored in two 14.000 gal. storage tanks. In total the two storage tanks can hold up to approximately 170,000 lbs. The ether is used in the manufacture of anionic surfactants, and also in the sodium phenoxyacetate process. The ether is recycled on site and reused in the processes. Safety systems include heat sensors that activate tank deluge systems, and ambient air LEL monitors. \nNiacet has developed a management system to oversee the implementation"

The Manager,Quality Assurance& Regulatory Affairs reports directly to the co-Managing Directors. He may assign responsibility of individual requirements to qualified individuals identified in the Niacet organizational chart.\nNiacet is committed to operating our Niagara Falls, NY facility in a safe and responsible manner. Our long history of no off site releases of RMP regulated chemicals speaks for itself. This is due to the layers of safeguards in place to prevent the release of hazardous substances. In the unlikely event of a chemical release, comprehensive emergency response plans are in place to bring any situation to a safe resolution. Niacet regularly meets with local emergency responders, and conducts on going training of emplyees and off site responders to be prepared in the unlikely event of an emergency situation.\n\nAccident prevention is a key element of Niacet's RMP plan. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releae of hazardous chemicals. Niacet's RMP plan includes the adoption of OSHA's accidental prevention program. Some key elements include: Operating procedures, Process safety information, Process hazard analysis, Training, Mechanical integrity, Incident investigations, Compliance audits, Management of change, Contractors, Pre-startup review, and Employee participation.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety include our comprehensive safety improvement program. This includes the establishment of a joint Union/management Safety committee, review of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, solicitation of suggestions, and the maintenance of regular departmental safety meetings.\n\n\n\n\n NIACET CORPORATION               12/31/03\n\n\n\nEach indust"

Any\n\nalternate or more likely release scenario must also be included. The hazard\n\nassessment must include an estimate of potential release quantities\n\nincluding the distance affected, and potential effects on people and the\n\nenvironment. A five year accidental release is also included in the\n\nassessments. Niacet has had no releases of RMP regulated chemicals in the\n\npast 5 years.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances: Chlorine\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario for chlorine at Niacet Corporation is the\n\nrelease of the contents of a full liquid railcar over a 10 minute period as\n\nmandated by RMP guidelines. This scenario assumes that the entire 180,000\n\nlbs of liquid chlorine vaporizes within the 10 minute interval. The worst\n\ncase scenario was evaluated using the EPA look up tables identified in the\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document. Under least favorable\n\nweather conditions, the chlorine gas would travel a distance greater than\n\n25 miles before the concentration was reduced to below 3 parts per million.\n\nIt is estimated that 1,200,000 people live within this 25 mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe alternative case scenario for chlorine is a failure of a 1\" pipe at our\n\nchlorine vaporizer. We estimate that this failure could result in the\n\nrelease of 600 lbs of chlorine over a 20 minute interval. This scenario was\n\nalso evaluated using the EPA look up tables identified in the Offsite\n\nConsequence Analysis Guidance document. It is estimated that this release\n\nwould travel a distance of 0.56 miles before the concentration was reduced\n\nto below 3 parts per million. It is estimated that 600 people live within\n\nthis 0.56 mile radius.\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances: Ethyl Ether\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario for flammables is fixed by RMP guidelines. For this\n\nscenario the entire contents of an ethyl ether tank at 83,000 lbs is\n\npresumed to vaporize and produce a vapor cl"
