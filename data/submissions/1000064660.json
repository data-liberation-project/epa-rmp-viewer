The facility was completed and began packaging operation in 1998.  The facility is situated on approximately 9 acres located at 334 Tidal Road in Deer Park, Texas 77536.\r\n\r\n1.2\tACIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICES\r\nDelta Deer Park is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, instillation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training on facility processes. It is Delta's policy to implement appropriate controls to reduce and prevent the release of regulated substances. Delta has trained emergency response personnel on site for release response.\r\n\r\n1.3\t THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\nThe Delta Deer Park facility's primary activities are packaging, warehousing and distribution of chemicals. The regulated substances handled by the facility are listed below.  Delta Deer Park receives the regulated substances in bulk tanker trucks, rail cars and iso tanks and transfers them to 55-gallon drums, 275 gallon totes and other smaller containers.  Filled containers are then warehoused or shipped depending on customer specifications.  Inventory is dependent upon customer orders and not all regulated substances are always present onsite. Typical Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) are provided for all predicted regulated substances in Appendix A.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical:\t                  CAS No.\r\n\r\nToxic Substances:\t\r\n\r\nToluene 2,4 Diisocyanate (TDI)\t 584-84-9\r\nToluene 2,6 Diisocyanate (TDI)\t 91-08-7\r\nEthylenediamine\t                 107-15-3\r\nVinyl Acetate Monomer\t         108-05-4\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4\tTHE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nDelta Deer Park is the operator of a stationary source that has more than the"

Delta Deer Park is a Program 2 level facility.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternative scenarios, EPA's RMP*Comp&trade; program was used to evaluate off-site consequences.  RMP*Comp&trade; is based on the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the regulated chemicals involves the catastrophic failure of the largest vessel containing the regulated substance at the facility and is a rail car (est. 20,600 gallons).\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenarios include:\r\n3 hose with 1 puncture while filling at 90A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \r\nA 3 hose with 1 puncture while filling at 70A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \r\nA 3 hose separation flange at 90A\u00b0F, that leaks for 5 minutes.  \r\nA four drums falling off the loading dock and contents leaking within one minute at 100A\u00b0F.  \r\nA overfilling of a drum at the filler for 1 minute at 90A\u00b0F.  \r\n\r\nNone of these scenarios are likely to result in the full amount of the regulated substances being released because of onsite personnel and other mitigation techniques, but for the worst-case and alternative scenarios these situations were used as potential possibilities that could have offsite consequences, as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and 40 CFR 68.28.\r\n\r\n1.5\tTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nDelta Deer Park has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. The packaging and warehouse process at the facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPCRA Section 313 notification requirements.
