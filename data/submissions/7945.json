There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\n- Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\n- Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\n- Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\n- Chlorine system maintenance procedures\n\nNext, these additional steps were implemented to complete the PSM program.\n\n- Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity  and Incident Investigation.\n\n-Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\n\n-Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan\n\n-Training in support of the certification of operators\n          \nThe plant superintendent and company safety officer are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations.\n\nIn addition to PSM compliance, the plant has  implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals\n\n- In 1991 when the plant was constructed, a full vacuum chlorine delivery system as installed. This process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment that is exposed to pressurized chlorine.\n\n - Plant inventories are controlled to maintain only two cylinders connected to the process and two cylinders in reserve.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plans (ERP) have been significantly upgraded.

      "SummaryText": "999, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a professional organization to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are routinely conducted.\n\nTo further understand chlorine risks, a consulting firm was contracted to conduct \"Offsite Consequence\" Modeling Analysis, as required by EPA's Risk Management Program. Both a \"Worst Case\" and an \"Alternative Case\" chlorine release scenarios were studied for the site.\n\nThe \"Worst Case\" modeling showed the potential impact of a full, 2000 pound cylinder of chlorine released in 10 minutes. This resulting chlorine plume extended 0.9 miles. For the \"Alternative Case,\" a more typical possible release of 180 pounds, three pounds/minute for 60 minutes, was modeled. The modeling indicated that a plume extending 0.1 miles would result.\n\nThe modeling showed that the risk of chlorine exposure is low due to the favorable location of the plant. The  Water Treatment Plant is located west of the Town or Ramseur on a bank of Sandy Creek. Due to the topography and location of the plant, the most likely scenario would be for any chlorine release to fall to and be contained within the banks of Sandy Creek and the Deep River (which receives Sandy Creek about = mile below the plant) until dissipated. Thus, the impact of a chlorine release should result in no to minimum public exposure.\n\nIn addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. Hydro Management Services  has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt  the Water Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss"
