The Rupert facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders. This facility has implemented an electronic preventive maintenance system.  This is a system that uses a real time database to track inspection dates and issue reminders to responsible groups.  Training is tracked on an internal spreadsheet.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at the Rupert facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  The City of Rupert Fire Department is the first responder in an emergency situation.  The Idaho Emergency Services is also contacted in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\r\n\r\n2.0 Process Description and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Rupert, ID plant is a manufacturer of cheese products. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the primary process at this facility is 311513.   The facility is capable of producing and packaging various dairy products including natural cheese, cream and concentrated whey protein for processing by others.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the dairy products.  Some of these areas include: storage tanks and silos containing raw materials and product.  Refrigeration also involves the use of glycol cooling systems at some locations at the plant.\r\n\r\nThe Rupert plant has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a cooling agent in the plant\u00bfs refrigeration process. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia thr"

      "SummaryText": "eshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is 21,000 pounds, system design is capable of holding 28,500 pounds.  Thus, 40 CFR 68 is applicable to Brewster West, LLC in Rupert.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia is flammable in a very narrow and high range of concentration with a high ignition temperature.  It is not poisonous, but it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\r\n\r\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\r\n\r\n1. Irritation of respiratory tract,\r\n2. Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue,\r\n3. Freezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Worst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\n \r\nAlthough there are quality and safety systems in place at Brewster West\u00bfs Rupert plant, the ammonia refrigeration system has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public if there is a release from the system. Although the alternative release scenario is more probable, the US EPA requires that one worst-case and one alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated chemical.  Given the safety precautions at the plant, both scenarios are unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia release scenarios were modeled using EPA\u00bfs RMP*COMP to obtain the distance to\r\nendpoint.  The endpoint, as defined by the US EPA, is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline,\r\nLevel - 2 (ERPG-2).  The ERPG-2 was developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association and is applicable to human exposures for up to one hour.  The ERPG-2 i"

Ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program, which is identical to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.    EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, the Rupert facility\u00bfs ammonia PSM should meet the requirements for the RMP document.  \r\n\r\nThere are several aspects of the prevention program that are key: \r\n\r\n1. Since most of the pipework is out of the way of people and the machinery, there is less of a chance of an ammonia release.\r\n2. The plant maintains good training, certification and employee awareness of operating procedures.\r\n\r\n3. The plant has developed a strong preventive maintenance and inspection program.\r\n\r\n5.0 Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Brewster West plant is a new business as of April 1, 2007.  Brewster West has retained former Kraft Food\u00bfs management and maintenance personnel to operate the plant.  A review of this facility's accident history includes the following range of dates: January 1, 2002 - April 1, 2012.   According to 40 CFR Part 68.42(a), there have been no accidental releases, for ammonia, at this facility.\r\n\r\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan.  Brewster West, LLC Environmental Affairs and the City of Rupert Fire Department have reviewed this plan.\r\n\r\nThe City of Rupert Fire Department is the first responder in the event of an emergency.  The Fire Department is notified and will arrive at the facility within three minutes of the initial alarm.  \r\n\r\nTraining is conducted with the fire department on an annual basis.  The training includes an extensive facility evaluation and a tabletop"

Facility employees are trained to the awareness levels for hazardous chemicals, releases, and fire emergencies (they are not trained to be first responders).  Evacuation drills are also conducted on a regular schedule.\r\n\r\n7.0 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBased on the Process Hazard Analysis (what-if PHA) completed for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and monitored to determine if implementation was accomplished.  For example, in the ammonia system, a leak from condenser fittings, piping, pressure relief valves or other instrumentation is a potential release scenario. The following action item was recommended: replace older valves and put valves on a 5-year replacement schedule.  The recommendations were followed and the applicable valves were replaced, and the replacement schedule was implemented.  There are numerous other examples of safety improvements as a result of the PHA.  These include:\r\n\r\n1. Install safety ladders where appropriate. (Implemented, 1998-1999)\r\n\r\n2. Label valves and piping. (Implemented, 1997-1998)\r\n\r\n3. Re-route/replace/remove certain piping runs. (Implemented, 1997-1998)\r\n\r\n4. Replace south condenser fan. (Implemented, 1997-1998)\r\n\r\n5. Develop maintenance and standard testing procedures for the ammonia detection system and ventilation systems (on-going implementation)\r\n\r\n6.Last 3 yr Compliance Audit March 03, 2011.
