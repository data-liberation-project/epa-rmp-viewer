Main Street, Blackfoot, Idaho are commited to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.    Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at UAP Northwest is the storage and sale of fertilizers.  For this RMP a non-hazardous fertilizer produced from a mobile reactor.\n\nThe substance(s) that are occasionally stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshhold level for the RMP.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is recieved via rail car and reacted with Phosphoric Acid to produce ammonia polyphosphate fertilizer.  This end product is considered non-hazardous.  This fertilizer is utilized for land application in crop production.\n\nThe reactor utilized in this process is not the property UAP Northwest.  it is a private company that travels with this equipment to various states providing service for retail fertilizer locations.  No employee of UAP Northwest are involved in this processing.  The sole reason the regulated substance is on Uap Northwest's property is for the purpose of making this non-hazardous end product fertilizer.  There is no storage of a regulated substance un Clean Air Act 112(r).\n\n3.     Worst-Case and Alternate Release Scenerio\n\nThe worst-case release scenerio for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car release as a gas over a 10 minutes period.  The maximum quantity released as a gas over a 10 minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest rail car at 85 percent capacity, as limited by desi"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.18 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario based on the five year accident history ( or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose, which is estimated to release 11,908 pounds over a release duration of 2 minutes.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4.     Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written Emergency Contingency plan (C-Plan).  The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under; OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38,1910.119 and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264, subpart D, and part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA - FRP - 40 CFR part 194.  Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and Community Right-To-Know, pre emergency planning and emergency response information.\n\n5.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe users of Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc (ANSI K61.1).; California code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n6.     Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of Anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nhave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility, and by the owner of the reactor.  Periodic evaluations are performed to asses the maintenance of safe conditions"
