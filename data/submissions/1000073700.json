Additionally, the distance to endpoint concentration will be mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and associated piping are inside the Wolverine Packing Company building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\r\n\r\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\r\n\r\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place. The Preventive Program 3 provides extensive maintenance and operator/mechanic training to ensure that the system's mechanical integrity is maintained for the life of the covered process. Program 3 also incorporates administrative controls when modifications are made to the covered process (ammonia refrigeration system), so the training and preventative programs are updated as the system expands and changes.

The five-year accident history\r\n\r\nThere have been no incidents or accidents at the facility that meet the threshold for reporting for to the EPA in the past five (5) years.

The emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program. Wolverine Packing Company has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The Wolverine Packing Company conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nThe Wolverine Packing Company is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the Wolverine Packing Company to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of Wolverine Packing Company employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
