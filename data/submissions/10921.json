      "SummaryText": "Alcan Ingot, Inc. (Alcan) located in Henderson, Kentucky is a primary aluminum smelter plant.  It has approximately 16,000 pounds of chlorine in storage.  The chlorine is stored and used at two locations, the casting plant and the potable water treatment plant, in one-ton cylinders.  The chlorine storage is subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations under 29 CFR 1910.119 for Process Safety Management (PSM) based on Alcan's storage of greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine.  Alcan's Health, Safety and Industrial Hygiene Group has completed and implemented such a program.  Alcan is also subject to CAA Section 112(r)(7) requirements for chlorine in each plant.  This regulation requires affected facilities to develop hazard assessments, management programs, prevention programs, and emergency response programs.  A facility is covered by the RMP rule if it has in inventory a regulated chemical in greater than the threshold quantity.  Forchlorine, the level is 2,500 pounds; therefore, the Alcan plant is also regulated by the RMP regulations.  Alcan has previously met many of the requirements with the implementation of the Process Safety Management Plan.  The attached Risk Management Plan submittal shows that Alcan is meeting the requirements of 112(R). \n\nAlso, 240,000 gallons of propane is stored in five, 90,000 gallons capacity, underground storage tanks. There is no PSM requirement for propane in the OSHA regulations. The CAA Section 112(R)(7) regulation states that facilities that store greater than 10,000 pounds (approximately 2,300 gallons) of flammable substances including propane must comply with this rule.  At this time, changes in the regulations for flammable substances, including propane are pending.  Alcan is voluntarily submitting information pertaining to propane in this program.  Alcan reserves the right to revise the Risk Management Plan to reflect the requirements of the stayed rule.  \n\nIn compliance"
