South Carolina Further Processing Plant\nExecutive Summary\n\nProcess:\n\nFPL Food - SC Further Processing Plant (FPL Food)  is a further processing facility that is in continuous operation during the week, which produces \"ready to cook\" and \"fully cooked\" beef products.  FPL Food utilizes a closed loop refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  The entire amount of anhydrous ammonia on site is approximately 34,000 pounds and is entirely contained in one system that is used for plant refrigeration and product freezing.  FPL Food is committed to the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system and complying with the requirements under EPAA?s Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHAA?s Process Safety Management Program (29CFR 1910.119).  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nFPL Food is dedicated to the safe operation of its refrigeration system and to the safety of the employees, public and environment.  FPL Food conducts employee training in accordance with the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200).  We also perform annual HAZWOPER training and retraining of key employees who will perform work in refrigeration rooms and may be the first to recognize an ammonia release.  FPL Food has also invited the South Congaree Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT members onsite to increase their awareness and familiarity of our facility, processes and refrigeration system.\n\nRelease Scenarios:\n\nFPL Food has developed models of release scenarios at this facility to identify the potentially affected areas.  The EPA release estimation program RMP*Comp was used to calculate the release rates and distances to the level of concern.  This is not an exact prediction of what would occur in the event of a release, but an estimate of the affected area in the event of a release based on standardized weather parameters.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia or o"

The ammonia system is constantly monitored by a computerized control system and properly trained employees to ensure that all equipment is operating within expected parameters.  Procedures have been written and implemented on how to properly isolate and shutdown the refrigeration system components in the event of an emergency.  Multiple safety devices are used on each piece of equipment to prevent an accidental release or minimize the impacts of an accidental release.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nFPL Food has developed a plan to provide notification and evacuation of plant employees and the surrounding public in the event of a significant ammonia release.  Procedures have been developed to notify the South Congaree Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT Team to respond to any substantial ammonia release.  Procedures have also been developed for the notification of the Lexington County LEPC, the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) (SERC) and the National Response Center (NRC).  Members of the South Congaree Fire Department and the Lexington County HAZMAT Team have been invited to review the site in order to become more familiar with the processes and plant layout.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nPeriodic inspections and tests are performed on the system, including an annual complete system inspection and a 5-year independent inspection by an outside refrigeration specialist.  FPL Food performs a complete review of the refrigeration process when changes to the design are proposed (Process Hazard Analysis).  Through this review process, we identify and imp"
