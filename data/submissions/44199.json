Penray people are dedicated to providing quality products and services using safe and environmentally acceptable manufacturing techniques uniquely applied to fill customer needs.\n\nThe management of Penray is dedicated to creating an environment where employee participation is encouraged and creativity is recognized.  In order to meet or exceed our customer and community\u00bfs expectations, we provide our employees with the necessary training and tools to fulfill their individual missions.  In this process all employees are expected to work in a team environment and to treat one another, customers, suppliers and our neighbors with respect and without discrimination.\n\nIt is Penray\u00bfs intent to produce and sell only those products that can be manufactured, used and disposed of in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.

We, therefore, continuously review all Penray\u00bfs procedures, practices, and our products, in order to ensure compliance and minimize risks to our employees, neighbors and our customers.\n\nThe production process at the Wheeling manufacturing plant consists primarily of the mixing, filling and packaging of aerosol products.  The production process begins in the filling room where three production lines, including one double line are housed.  At the beginning of the production line, empty aerosol cans move to the filling machines that dispense a measured amount of product formulation into the can.  The product formulation is blended in a separate mixing room and then piped to the filling machines.  After being filled, the cans are topped and sealed and then sent through an"

There, the cans first pass through a heated water-testing tank that tests each can for safety.  Following this safety check, spray tips and plastic caps are put in place and the product is date coded.  The finished aerosol cans are then packed in cartons which are sealed by a gluing machine, stacked on pallets and then moved to finished goods inventory.\n\nThe Wheeling facility is located at 440 Denniston Court, Wheeling, Illinois 26 miles northwest of downtown Chicago.  It houses the executive and administrative offices for The Penray Companies, manufacturing facilities, laboratory, inventory storage, chemical storage and blending facilities.\n\nThe property consists of a modern one-story masonry and metal-sided industrial building containing approximately 88,300 square feet.  The facility includes approximately 10,000 square feet of modern air-conditioned office space and asphalt paved parking with room to accommodate employee and customer needs.  The facility also contains two loading docks, one to receive materials and the other to ship finished goods.  Penray also owns a sizeable empty lot adjacent to the facility.\n\nThe facility\u00bfs laboratory tests all products that are manufactured for content and safety requirements.  All research and development operations are conducted at the Wheeling laboratory.  The laboratory is considered modern and well equipped by industry standards and is capable of performing all potential services required by the facility.\n\nPenray\u00bfs manufacturing facility in Wheeling, Illinois works closely with community and has a very good relationship with the Wheeling Fire Department.
