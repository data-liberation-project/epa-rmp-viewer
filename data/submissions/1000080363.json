Most of the 300 employees at the McIntosh facility live in Washington, Mobile, Clarke and Baldwin counties. Olin employees are involved in the communities and care about the environment which all of us in Southern Alabama share and enjoy.  Maintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at our plant. We understand that we are an integral part of the community. \n\n\n\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin McIntosh Plant. Our primary products: Chlorine, Caustic Soda, Hydrochloric Acid and Sodium Hypochlorite are used to make everything from paper products, clothing, clean water, household bleach, and pharmaceuticals, to plastics, vinyl products, antifreeze, fuels, and paints, and sold to local industrial customers.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nSince it's beginning, Olin has had a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable. Our \"Goal is Zero\" incidents for environmental, safety, security, and transportation. To help insure that an emergency situation with offsite implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety protection in place:  Employees, Mechanical integrity, Process Hazard Reviews, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness.\n\n\n\nAt the Olin, McIntosh, Alabama facility, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by"

In the case of hydrogen, the volume is less than 100 pounds. The threshold for flammables is 10,000 pounds or greater. This product is shipped by pipeline to near industrial neighbors to be used as fuel or processed to a liquid form. Hydrochloric Acid solution is regulated by RMP at 37% concentration or greater. The guidelines at McIntosh are that we do not receive or manufacture acid that exceeds that concentration.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use, manufacturing, or handling of Chlorine.  There have been two RMP releases in the past five years.\n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following prevention steps:\n\n* Site wide chlorine monitors \n\n* Automatic shut off valves for loading operations\n\n* Well trained work force\n\n* Preventative and predictive maintenance systems through mechanical integrity\n\n"
