KMCLLC is committed to the guiding principles of American Chemical Council?s (ACC) Responsible Care ?.  KMCLLC has prepared a policy stating this and will provide the resources necessary to meet the requirements of these guiding principles.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n? A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n? A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n? A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n? An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n? An overview of our emergency response program\n? An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n? The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n? The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nFacility Description\n\nOur facility produces manganese dioxide, boron trichloride and elemental boron using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  In our processes, we use and/or store the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, boron trichloride and chlorine.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency plann"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nAmmonia\nLiquid ammonia is stored at the KMCLLC facility in horizontal tanks.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a tank failure and 10,100 pounds of ammonia, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the ammonia cloud will travel approximately 1.8 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\nThe ammonia alternative case scenario involves a pressure relief valve.  In this scenario, approximately 1,230 pounds of ammonia gas is released.  More typical atmospheric conditions are present and the modeling analysis shows the ammonia cloud will travel approximately 0.2 miles before the endpoint concentration is met.      \n\nHydrogen Sulfide\nLiquid hydrogen sulfide is stored at the KMCLLC facility in a tank trailer.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a trailer failure and 28,000 pounds of hydrogen sulfide, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the hydrogen sulfide cloud will travel approximately 9.3 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint  concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\nThe hydrog"

As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a storage vessel failure and 5250 pounds of boron trichloride, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the boron trichloride cloud will travel approximately 0.25 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\nThe boron trichloride alternative case scenario involves a leak from the storage vessel.  In this scenario, approximately 1,200 pounds of boron trichloride gas is released.  More typical atmospheric conditions are present and the modeling analysis shows the boron trichloride cloud will travel approximately 0.25 miles before the endpoint concentration is met.      \n\nChlorine\nLiquid chlorine is stored at the KMCLLC facility in one ton cylinders.  As required by RMP, the worst case scenario involves a cylinder rupture and 2000 pounds of chlorine, as a gas, is released in 10 minutes. The worst case occurs at a time that there is little wind and the atmosphere is very stable.  This means that little dispersion will occur.  The model results show that the chlorine cloud will travel approximately 3.1 miles before dispersing to a concentration less than the endpoint  concentration in the RMP rule, Appendix A.\n\nThe chlorine alternative case scenario involves a leak from the storage vessel.
