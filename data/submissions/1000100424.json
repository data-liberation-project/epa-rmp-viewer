The most recent / revision of the operating procedures for the chlorination system was conducted on August 22, 2022.  \n\nTraining\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that the operating staff is competent to operate the plant\u0092s chlorination system.  Refresher training is provided at least yearly and more frequently as needed.  The training program was last reviewed/revised on August 22, 2022.  The training was completed on August 22, 2022.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPreventative maintenance, inspection, and testing of the chlorination equipment are critical to the mechanical integrity of the system and its safe operation.  Written inspection/preventative maintenance procedures for the chlorination equipment are used at the plant.  The preventative maintenance procedures/schedule were reviewed/ revised on March 24, 2022.  The most recent equipment inspection/ testing was conducted on 02/09/2022 by Carolina Technical Services.\n\nIncident Investigation\nThe City of Abbeville has in place an incident investigation procedure that calls for the investigation of each incident that results in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine from its facilities.  An investigation is initiated as promptly as possible by an incident investigation team, but not later than 48 hours following the incident. Incident investigations have not been required in the last five years.\n\nCompliance Audits\nThe City of Abbeville has selected personnel to conduct audit"

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and audits associated with the chlorination system at the water treatment plant.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The utility is coordinated with the Abbeville Fire Department, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a release of chlorine, and is currently included in the Abbeville County Community Emergency Response Plan.\n\nOur Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at the City of Abbeville water treatment plant above the threshold quantity. Chlorine dioxide is a regulated substance that is present, but not above the regulated quantity of 1,000 lbs.  Chlorine is used for disinfection in the production of potable water. Chlorine used for gaseous chlorine disinfection is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 pounds per square inch).  Chlorine gas is nonflammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support the combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 8,000 lbs (pounds) or four (4) 2,000-lb cylinders. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with a fusible plug that is designed to fail if the temperature of the cylinder reaches approximately 158\u00b0F (Fahrenheit). The purpose of the fusible plug is to prevent cylinder failure in"

The gaseous chlorination system is a vacuum feed system with safety features such as automatic shutoff at the container during a loss of vacuum, chlorine gas detection, and alarm.  \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements, as the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under the South Carolina OSHA program.  The following sections briefly review and update the elements of the Program 3 prevention program.  In the past five years, the water treatment plant has taken all the necessary steps to address the requirements of each element of the program.  Chlorine dioxide is produced on-site in a 50-gallon tank by mixing sodium chlorine and gaseous chlorine.  This was redone in April 2016 to a continuous process.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe operating staff at the water treatment plant ensures the process safety information that describes the chemical properties and hazards, operating parameters, and process equipment associated with the chlorination system is accurate and complete. Process safety information was last reviewed on March 24, 2022.  The only recent change has been to include the chlorine dioxide disinfection system at the end of 2012.  This was redone in April 2016 due to the system change to a continuous process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe utility district uses personnel familiar with the plant's chlorination system and the PHA technique to review the hazards of the process and to review the adequacy of the safeguards in place.

The most recent self-audit was conducted on March 24, 2022.  Changes were recommended by the audit team and are being addressed.  Most of the changes were due to personnel changes at the water treatment plant. \n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at the water treatment plant to safely manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures of the chlorination system.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a change to the Chlorination system are promptly informed of the change and offered training on the change before startup. In the last five (5) years, there has not been a major change to the chlorination system that would have triggered the management of change procedure. The last review/revision of the management of change procedure was on February 21, 2017.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews are required for major changes to the chlorination system.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and equipment meet design specifications and that operations and maintenance procedures are in place for the safe startup and operation of the system.

There have been no reportable accidental releases during this period.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe water treatment plant has in place a written emergency plan to deal with various emergency situations.  This plan is supplemented by an emergency response procedure specifically for minor chlorine releases.  To ensure proper response during an emergency, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the process that would require a modified emergency response.
