We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  EDCC maintains an open dialogue with local emergency responders and has provided them with a copy of its Emergency Response Plan, detailing important facility-specific information.  This document, or Risk Management Plan (RMP), provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including the following:\n\n?    a description of our facility and use of substances exceeding threshold quantities, in a single process, which are regulated by EPA?s Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule),\n?    a summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from possible accidental chemical releases,\n?    an overview of our accidental release prevention programs,\n?    a five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by the RMP Rule,\n?    an overview of the Emergency Response Program, and\n?    an overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\n2.0  El Dorado Chemical Company and Regulated Substances\n\n    Our facility?s primary activity involves the production of ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid.  These products are used extensively in the agricultural, mining, specialty chemical manufacturing, and forestry products industries.  From a consumer?s viewpoint, these products are used in the manufacture of paper, water treatment chemicals, computer chips, and even blue jean dye to name a few of our product"

Also, EDCC parallels the RMP Rule by complying with Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910 119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program in place at our stationary sources.\n\n3.1  Process Safety Information\n\nEDCC maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n3.2  Process Hazard Analysis\n\n    Our facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the ?HAZOP? and/or the ?what if? checklist.  These analyses are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals.

In addition, Daily/Shift Safe Work Permits (Procedure No. S-82) are required for any maintenance work completed at EDCC.\n\n3.4  Training\n\n    EDCC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided continuously for operator certification.\n\n3.5  Mechanical Integrity\n\n    EDCC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes:\n\n?    pressure vessels, \n?    storage tanks, \n?    piping systems, \n?    relief and vent systems,\n?    emergency shutdown systems,\n?    controls, and \n?    pumps.  \n\nTrained maintenance personnel and our mechanical integrity engineer conduct the process maintenance activities.

These audits are carried out at least every three years by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  Corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\n3.9  Incident Investigation\n\nEDCC promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root cause of the incident, as well as any corrective actions needed to prevent the release from recurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n3.10  Employee Participation\n\nEDCC believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to their work and the processes.  A Daily/Shift Safe Work Permit is issued prior to beginning work.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n4.0  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n4.1  Nitric Acid and Ammonia\n\nSeveral process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental releases of nitric acid or ammonia.  These controls include vents, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shut-offs, interlocks, alarms, keyed bypass system, emergency back-up power, back-up pumps, rupture disks, excess flow devices, and quench systems.  Passive mitigation includes earthen dikes that route spills to neutralization and the wastewater treatment system, a deluge system, water curtains, and enclosures.  Process area detectors and perimeter monitors are in place to promptly alert staff to accidental releases. \n\n4.2  Chlorine\n\n    Several process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of chlorine.  These controls include vents, relief and check valves, manual shut-offs, and quench systems.  A water curtain is available to mitigate releases.  Chlorine cylinders are inspected regularly to ensure they are free of leaks.\n\n4.3  Oleum\n\n    Oleum will be used in a new process expected to be online in July 2005.  Process controls are in place to prevent and/or mitigate accidental release of oleum to the environment.  The tank is installed with a vacuum breaker, sumps that pump lost solution back to the process and a scrubber with an induced draft blower to collect all vents and remove any vaporized sulfur trioxide by dissolving in water to form sulfuric acid.  The sulfuric acid is returned to the process.  A concrete dike (102? X 42? X"

The program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting the workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The Plan includes the following components:\n\n?    procedures for informing the public and emergency responders of accidental releases,\n?    documentation of proper first aid/emergency medical treatment that may be necessary to treat exposure,\n?    emergency response procedures,\n?    procedures for using, inspecting, testing, and maintaining response equipment,\n?    employee training, and\n?"

      "SummaryText": "    response plan review and update procedures.\n\nCoordination of the Plan with the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) is an integral part of the verification process.  \n\n\n7.0  Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nEDCC is actively promoting public awareness and education programs concerning emergency response through the Union County Local Emergency Planning Committee and Community Advisory Panel.  This education process enhances the public?s ability to respond in a given emergency situation.  EDCC continually strives to improve and upgrade operating procedures, replace or maintain equipment, and develop and implement safety improvement projects.  A list of proposed future improvements is as follows:\n\n?    installation of a scrubber system at the E2 ammonium nitrate plant, \n?    provide EMT training to employees, and\n?    increase site security measures.\n\nEDCC realizes the improvements listed above are necessary for improving our safety and emergency response capabilities."
