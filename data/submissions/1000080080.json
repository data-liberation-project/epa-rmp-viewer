The PHA Revalidation study included a discussion of any changes to the chlorine systems since the previous PHA study, a detailed review of the recommended action items generated during the previous PHA study, a discussion of the facility's accident history dating back five years, the completion of chlorine industry checklists, and the detailed HAZOP analysis that reviewed potential hazards and operability issues with the chlorine systems.  A Three-Year Compliance Audit was also conducted in June 2019 that identified compliance-related issues to improve.\r\n\r\nThe Water Operations Department PSM Committee meets routinely (typically quarterly) to ensure that items recommended in studies such as PHAs, Compliance Audits, Seismic Assessments, and regulatory inspections are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nCarlsbad MWD also plans to improve safety as follows:\r\n\r\n - Continued involvement of water operations staff in the ongoing development and implementation of the risk management policies and procedures.\r\n - Attendance and participation of key personnel in industry groups, such as AWWA, ensure the department is aware of evolving industry standards and techniques implemented to encourage safety.\r\n - Conducting routine RMP and PSM meetings to ensure any issues identified by water operations staff, contractors, or consultants are discussed and addressed.\r\n - Continuing training and certification program for all water operations staff that is overseen by the State Water Resources Control Board."

The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning & Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained by the Water Operations Department and updated as necessary.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)  To save lives.\r\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.)  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.)  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  Emergency response policies and protocols were recently coordinated with the Carlsbad Fire Department and the San Diego County Hazardous Incident Response Team (HIRT) to ensure a mutual understanding of roles and responsibilities during a chlorine emergency situation.  This included familiarization training classes, as well as mock release / rescue scenarios.\r\n\r\nSince the facility is normally unmanned, water operators are typically the only personnel on site.  In case of a chlorine leak detection at the facility, the on-call Duty Operator is alerted via SCADA system.  The Duty Operator alerts the MWD Supervisor and Utilities Manager and immediately responds to the alarm.  Upon arrival, the Duty Operator determines whether or not the Fire Department should be called to respond to the emergency based on the severity of the incident.  The duty operator assignment is made on a rotating basis between the various trained and qualified Water Operations staff.  Each water operator has the necessary hazardous materials training to be considered qualified to assess the severity of a potential chlorine"

Much of the safety design is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the chlorine processes.  For example, the Carlsbad MWD treatment systems operate in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the primary engineering or administration controls at the facility fail and result in a release of chlorine, there are four mechanisms in the facility to minimize the impact: 1) chlorine gas detectors, 2) visual/audible alarms, 3) emergency chlorine scrubber system, and 4) halogen motorized automatic shut-off valves.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine detectors located in the chlorine rooms at both stations trigger both alarms and shut off actions, as well as notifying the Water Operations Duty Operator.  At 1ppm, the leak detection system activates an audible alarm and triggers the SCADA system to notify the Duty Operator.  At 3ppm, the audible and visual alarms are activated, the motorized automatic shut off valves are triggered to close the one-ton container valve (equipped with battery backup power), the scrubber is activated that draws in the contents of the room to be neutralized, and the SCADA system sends another message to the Duty Operator that the motorized automatic shut off valve was activated.\r\n\r\nThe scrubber runs until the detector senses less than 1 ppm chlorine concentration in the room.  The scrubber for each facility has a capacity to neutralize 2,000 pounds of chlorine with a 99%+ rate of effectiveness.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a power failure, vacuum regulators prevent chlorine from escaping the system.  A backup generator that is activated during a power outage is maintained onsite to power the chlorine systems and water pumps.  If vacuum conditions are c"

The chlorine can be distributed to various points in the water system as needed based on water sampling results.  Each process feeds chlorine gas into solution at an injector where it is mixed with water, which eliminates the hazard of the chlorine gas.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine systems are integrated into the Water Operations Department's SCADA system, which provides remote access to system parameters and operating conditions, as well as security monitoring.  The SCADA system provides a readout of the weight of the one-ton container that is on-line, status of facility access doors, and leak detection monitoring.\r\n\r\nLead fuse plugs that included in the design of the one-ton containers are designed to yield and melt between 158\u00b0F and 165\u00b0F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe one-ton containers are stored in the Chlorine Tank Room, which is protected by a scrubber with a capacity to neutralize up to 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas.  The scrubber is activated based on the alarm status of a chlorine leak detector located in the Chlorine Tank Room.

Only two rotameters are used at the Upper Maerkle Station.  Prior to injection, the chlorine gas passes through a chlorine dioxide generator that used sodium hypochlorite as a reagent to create chlorine dioxide.  The process feeds this chlorine dioxide into solution at the injector where it is mixed with water.  Similar chlorine detection and scrubber sys"

Empty containers are also stored in the chlorine room until being picked up by the chlorine vendor during the next chemical delivery.\r\n\r\nTwo (2) one-ton containers are on-line at any one time where one is in operation and the other is on standby.  The on-line containers are each placed on a digital scale that indicates the remaining weight of chlorine in each of the on-line one-ton containers to allow system operators to monitor usage and plan ahead for ordering more chlorine.  The chlorine system is operated entirely under vacuum conditions with a vacuum regulator attached to each of the one-ton container valves.  Each one-ton container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  The system connections are made at the top container valve to ensure that chlorine gas (not liquid) is drawn out of the container.\r\n \r\nChlorine gas is drawn from operating on-line one-ton container through an automatic switchover / vacuum regulator.  The automatic switchover regulator valves control which container is actively feeding chlorine to the vacuum regulator.  A vacuum (negative pressure) is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.  If a loss of vacuum were to occur in the line downstream of the vacuum regulator, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine gas from escaping from the system.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum (downstream of the vacuum leak) will be drawn to the injection point and into the water solution.\r\n\r\nDownstream of the vacuum regulator, chlo"
