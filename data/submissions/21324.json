All applicable procedures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  PP&L has developed accidental release mitigation policies specific to the covered process and chemical which are supported by other safety policies implemented by the plant.  The PP&L emergency response program policy dictates the implementation of response plans detailed specifically to the PP&L covered process and chemical and to the emergency response services available in the community.  An offsite emergency response plan, developed by the Montour County Emergency Management Agency, has been in-place for other chemicals at the site.  That plan will be modified with support of PP&L, to include the covered chemical.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe PP&L facility, located in Montour County is a fossil fuel based steam and electric plant.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from combustion off-gas.  NOx is reduced by mixing and reacting with ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia system includes railcars, and tanker trucks, bulk tanks, process piping, various safety & monitoring systems, compressors, and pumps.
