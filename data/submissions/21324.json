All applicable procedures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  PP&L has developed accidental release mitigation policies specific to the covered process and chemical which are supported by other safety policies implemented by the plant.  The PP&L emergency response program policy dictates the implementation of response plans detailed specifically to the PP&L covered process and chemical and to the emergency response services available in the community.  An offsite emergency response plan, developed by the Montour County Emergency Management Agency, has been in-place for other chemicals at the site.  That plan will be modified with support of PP&L, to include the covered chemical.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe PP&L facility, located in Montour County is a fossil fuel based steam and electric plant.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from combustion off-gas.  NOx is reduced by mixing and reacting with ammonia.  The anhydrous ammonia system includes railcars, and tanker trucks, bulk tanks, process piping, various safety & monitoring systems, compressors, and pumps.  This system is typically manned, and is monitored daily by operators.  The system is to be used on a seasonal basis, up to seven months a year.  Maintenance employees are on staff to respond to any alarms and to maintain the system.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios for this chemical, the \"worst case scenario\" and an \"alternate case scenario\".

The alternate case scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario\".\n\nWorst and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has been performed to determine the potential distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" specified in 40 CFR Part 68 Appendix A, which is 0.14 mg/L of air (200 ppm).  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\nThe worst case scenario involves a failure of the bulk ammonia tank, containing 272,320 lbs. of ammonia, released as a gas over a 10-minute period.  EPA mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily local temperature and average humidity of 71% were used for the worst case release scenario.   The facility is located in a rural area. Modeling results indicate that the worst case release scenario would encompass population and environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternate case scenario involves a breech (25% rupture) in the two-inch liquid ammonia line at a connection during a tanker transfer.  A conservative duration time factor of 10 minutes was used to account for the time it may take the operator of the tanker to become aware of the release and to terminate.  Average meteorological conditions were used for the alternate case release scenario modeling.  Results indicate that the alternate case would also encompass offsite population.\n\nAdministrative controls have been developed to minimize the potential for release and consequences.
