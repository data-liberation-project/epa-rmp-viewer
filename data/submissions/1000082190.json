Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Farmers Union Oil in Circle, Montana are strongly committed to employee, public,and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the McCone County fire department, which provides additional emergency response expertise, and the McCone county emergency planning committee.\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank and twenty 1,000-gallon nurse tanks at our facility in Circle, Montana (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored at 85% standard maximum storage capacity is 42,500-gallons (218,875 pounds)including the capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,325 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFarmers Union Oil maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effec"
