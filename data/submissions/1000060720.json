To fulfill this goal and commitment, Galaxy Chemicals has establish and practice  system and procedures to porvidie safe operation of the processess at the facility.  Galaxy Chemicals has implemented the risk  management program(RMP) as a part of our safety program.  This program also help us manage the risk at our  facililty and complies wth the requiremens of the Environmental Protection Agency's EPA requlation 40CFR Part 68,  Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs, ( the RMP rule).  This plan is intended to satisfy the Risk Management Plan requirement of the RMP ruls68.150 through 68.185.  This Risk Management Program also provide  public information about this program.\n\n\n\nOff Site Consequence Analaysis\n\nThe RMP rule requires Galaxy Chemicals to perform an offsite consequence analysis forone worst-case and alternate release scenario for the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, which is toxic substance. Both worst case and alternate scenario are included in the RMP filing.  \n\nThe worst case scenario is the falilure of  6365 gallons storage tank, which releases 50,000 lbs of HF to a toxic  end point of 7.5 miles with a population of 61,677 people.  \n\n\n\nThe alternate  case scenario uses a copper tube with a leak and developes a 1/8 inch hole.  The HF release is 15 lbs, to a toxic end point of 0.1 mile with a population of 80  people.  No enveironmental receptors are in distance. \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances and Galaxy Chemicals\n\nGalaxy Chemicals uses hydrogen fluoride, HF in many of its manufacturing process in 50% of higher concentration.  These process involve neutralization procedures with hydrogen fluoride and the final products contain trace amounts of hydrogen fluoride.  Hydrogen fluoride is stored in storage tanks for use in manufacturing.\n\n\n\nGalaxy Chem"

This process falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response and Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\n\n\nAt Galaxy Chemicals the safety of our employees, neighbours and the public and environment is the top priority and commitment which ensure the preservation of the accidental releases of the hazardous materials.
