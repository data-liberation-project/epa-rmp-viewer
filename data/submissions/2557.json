Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nCountry Oven Bakery recognizes management's responsibility in protecting the public, its employees,  the environment, equipment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Bowling Green facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Richard Noall, Plant Engineer, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impact and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and impro"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nCountry Oven Bakery is part of the Kroger Company.  The facility manufactures frozen dough products and bakery items.   It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 20,000 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Country Oven Bakery facility involves the release of 11,894 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the +20oF receiver.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as it could be at most 40% full under normal operating conditions.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been ca"

Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the liquid lines;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\nMost of the lines are elevated to min"

Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.  Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\n\nOperating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nTraining: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nContractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices."
