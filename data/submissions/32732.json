      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system.  Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of the Erie Logistics facility located in Maple Heights, Ohio (Erie - NEO) to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  Erie - NEO implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Response Plan to safely evacuate the facility and take offensive measures to control the incident.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nErie - NEO is located at 17000 Rockside Road in Maple Heights, Ohio.  The facility is situated 2 miles south of the I-480 and 3 miles west of the I-271.  The facility and the refrigeration system began operation in 1990, with system upgrades occurring in 1995 and again in 2000.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.\n\nThe primary business of Erie - NEO is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 9,694 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, dock operations, cold storage, and freezers.

AS A RESULT OF THIS PUMPDOWN, ERIE LOGISTICS - NEO IS NOW REPORTING ITS AMMONIA CHARGE TO BE 9,694.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Erie - NEO to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Erie - NEO's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safet"

For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alarm on the control panel in the event of a detection of 300 ppm, alarm in the facility at 350 ppm, and de-energize the system at 500 ppm.  There are also additional ammonia sensors located throughout the facility in the vicinity of refrigeration equipment.  In the event of detection during off-hours, the guard shack will receive an alarm and the contact the Emergency Response Team Coordinator.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nA review into the accident history of the facility revealed that there has been no reportable releases of ammonia at Erie - NEO over the past five years (June 1999 - June 2004.)  However, there have been small leaks which did not result in property damage, injuries, deaths, or off-site evacuations.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n? save lives;\n? minimize and avoid injuries;\n? protect the environment; and\n? minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility as well as detailing the training, procedures, and members of the Emergency Response Team.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe refrigeration system was thoro"

The 2003 PHA Revalidation consisted of a:\n\n? Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study;\n? series of safety checklists; and\n? facility inspection.\n\nThe mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and reviewing emergency response issues including wind sock locations, posting of maps, and conducting drills with facility personnel following startup.  All recommendations resultant from the revalidation study are due to be completed by July 2004."
