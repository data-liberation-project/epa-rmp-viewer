We at Hydrite Chemical are strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental responsibility.  It is our policy to control our processes to prevent the accidental release of harmful or noxious materials that could endanger or irritate our employees, plant visitors, or neighbors.  This commitment is integrated into our design standards, equipment installation and maintenance practices, operating procedures and training programs.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and trained written emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release from any of our processes.  These written plans have been provided to the local emergency response agencies including local emergency response personnel, hospitals, state and federal agencies.\n\nHydrite uses four chemicals regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management Program and the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Program.  These chemicals are Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous Ammonia, Aqueous Ammonia, and Chlorine.  The on-site storage of these materials exceed the threshold values and are covered in the Risk Management Plan.  Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous Ammonia and Chlorine are stored as liquid under pressure.\n\nRegulated materials are received from various suppliers and stored in containers including drums, tote tanks, tank trucks, bulk storage tanks and compressed gas cylinders.  These containers meet DOT specifications.

All processes that are subject to the OSHA PSM or EPA RMP program  undergo a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Written operating procedures have been developed and are reviewed on a regular basis.  Employee training procedures have been developed and are implemented ensuring the employees understand the hazards of the chemical, know how to operate the equipment, know how to shut down the process and how to respond to a release.  Pre-start up safety reviews are performed prior to operation of new equipment or receipt of new chemicals.  Equipment maintenance procedures have been developed and implemented, including routine inspections and scheduled maintenance.  Hydrite Chemical believes that every incident has the potential for serious impact and conducts Incident Investigations to determine root cause and corrective action for all releases.\n\nA review of the previous five year accident history indicates no releases of regulated materials.\n\nWorst case scenario for each regulated substance is based on the total loss of the maximum quantity stored in each vessel.  Release is assumed to occur over a 10 minute period with weather conditions as defined by EPA in the Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Hydrite has elected to use the ALOHA modeling package to keep our scenarios comparable with the local emergency response providers.  A limitation built into the ALOHA modeling package truncates all releases at a maximum impact zone of 6 miles, so the worst case scenario was modeled using RMP*Comp.  The worst case scenario for Sulfur Dioxide has the greatest impact zone and does have off-site impacts.   Due to ALOHA's inability to model aqueous solutions, Hydrite used RMP*Comp for modeling the Aqueous Ammonia scenarios.  The worst case scenario for aqueous ammonia stored in the warehouse does not have off-site public receptors and is a Program 1 process.\n\nAlter"

      "SummaryText": "nate release scenarios are based on events that can reasonably be expected to occur.  The Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide in the warehouse are stored in compressed cylinders which each contain 2000 pounds.  To mitigate the consequences of a release during a fire, the cylinders have fusible plugs. The alternate scenario for these cylinders assume failure on a fuseable plug.  The alternate scenarios for  Sulfur Dioxide bulk and Anhydrous Ammonia bulk assume a valve/hose failure on a delivery truck with emergency response time to reach remote shutoff valves of 20 minutes.  Aqueous Ammonia  assumes pump/seal failure which would release 500 gallons into a diked area.  Weather conditions used were as specified in the EPA Offsite Consequence analysis Guidance.  Modeling was conducted using ALOHA for the Sulfur Dioxide, Anhydrous Ammonia and Chlorine.  Due to ALOHA's inability to model aqueous solutions, Hydrite used RMP*Comp for modeling the bulk Aqueous Ammonia scenario.  All alternate scenarios have off-site impacts.  Aqueous Ammonia in the warehouse as a Program 1 process does not require an alternate scenario.\n\nHydrite Chemical has developed and maintains an Emergency Response Plan (Contingency Plan).   This Plan is integrated into the Local Emergency Planning Committees' (LEPC's) county wide plan.  The Plan is reviewed and updated as required.  Emergency Responders receive formal training on the Plan annually.  The Plan includes:\n\n? Actions facility personnel must take in the event of fire, explosion or  release\n\n? Arrangements with the local and state governments in the event of an accident\n\n? Names, addresses and telephone numbers of all emergency responders\n\n? Necessary emergency equipment and how it is to be implemented\n\n? Resources available at the plant for use in responding such as\n     chemical resistant suits, \n     self-contained breathing apparatus, \n     two way radios for communication, \n     gas monitors, and \n     repair kits for leaking cylinders and tanks"
