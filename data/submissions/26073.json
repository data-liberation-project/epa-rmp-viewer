      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Diaz Chemical Corporation\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Diaz Chemical Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass organic chemical intermediates manufacturing.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility. These substances are Bromine, which is reacted with aromatic raw materials (benzene, fluorobenzene, etc.), and 2-butene, which is reacted with bromine to make 2,3-dibromobutane.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Bromine at our facility is 75000 lb.\nThe maximum inventory of 2-butene at our facility is 33500 lb.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analyses for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Comp. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from bromine unloading. In this scenario 37000 lb. of Bromine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 700 minutes. The release rate has been limited to 5% of the maximum rate of the source by a system of administrative controls.  Passive mitigation systems such as an enclosure are also taken into account to calcula"

      "SummaryText": "te the scenario. These mitigation systems have the effect of reducing the release rate of the bromine, and also the total quantity released before other active response measures can be undertaken. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 4.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Bromine involves a release from a bromine cylinder puncture. The scenario involves the release of 2500 lb. of bromine. Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 800 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s), drain(s), sumps(s) and enclosure(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of reducing the amount of bromine available to evaporate (reducing liquid contact with the atmosphere). The release is also assumed to be controlled by sprinkler system(s), scrubber(s) and neutralization. These active mitigation systems have the effect of blanketing the liquid, forming a barrier, which prevents evaporation until the bromine can be neutralized. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0065 mg/L of Bromine is 0.2 miles.\n\nThe worst case scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a release from a 2-butene cylinder. In this scenario 275 lbs. of 2-butene is released. The flammable gas released is assumed to form a flammable cloud which is ignited by a source such as a lift truck. The release rate is based on a puncture of the cylinder, such as by a lift truck's fork. The cloud is expected to ignite to it's lower flammability limit, <0.1 miles. There have been no mitigation systems taken into account to calculate this scenario.\n\nThe alternate release scenario submitted for 2-butene involves a release from a cylinder.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDiaz Chemical Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. The hazard information is communicated to the LEPC and local hospital.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If/Checklist (combined). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA for bromine, the only RMP substance at the facility, was performed in 1994.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Diaz Chemical Corporation maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information"

Refresher training is provided at least every three years, as part of our PSM program, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDiaz Chemical Corporation carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Diaz Chemical Corporation to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of management of change procedures was performed in August, 1997. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Diaz Chemical Corporation. The most recent review was performed in May, 1999. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDiaz Chemical Corporation conducts audits on a regular basi"

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDiaz Chemical Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDiaz Chemical Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Diaz Chemical Corporation has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nDiaz Chemical Corporation has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.
