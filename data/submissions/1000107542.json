We are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the comprehensive accidental release prevention program that encompasses design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. Robust engineering controls are in place to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. The transloading facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe Lansing facility transloads and stores liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), almost entirely consisted of propane, from rail cars into storage tanks and transports to the customer. There are no RMP regulated toxics on site. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nA&B Railroad has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nA&B Railroad maintains a record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis [40 CFR Part 68.67]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What-if/Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findin"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nA&B Railroad has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nA&B Railroad carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at the facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures. Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at the transloading facility.

These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner. Note that this is a new facility and will conduct the first audit in 3 years.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nA&B Railroad promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nA&B Railroad believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, all employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nA&B Railroad has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operations conducted on or near the covered process. \n\nContractor Safety Program [40 CFR Part 68.87] \nA&B Railroad occasionally hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.
