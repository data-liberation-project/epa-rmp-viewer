Airgas is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  The Airgas Hopewell plant accidental release prevention program covers all aspects of the PSM and RMP regulations including design, installation, operations, maintenance and training.  The accidental release emergency response policy is to promptly take steps to isolate, abate and mitigate, report a situation to appropriate authorities and cooperate with authorities to protect lives and the environment.\r\n \r\nThe facility receives carbon dioxide gas and manufactures and stores liquid carbon dioxide and manufactures dry ice.  Anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant, is the only substance regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  The maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia on site is 12,250 pounds.\r\n \r\nProcess Safety Information:  The Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration facility is designed and constructed in accordance with accepted engineering and industrial codes and standards.  Airgas retains OEM information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration.  It diligently identifies process hazards and controls them efficiently.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is used to review design and operation of the Anhydrous Ammonia refrigeration facility.  It was used for initial startup and is repeated every five years unless process change triggers a PHA revalidation.\r\n \r\nOperating Procedures:  Airgas uses written operating procedures for process safety.  Operating procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup"

Refresher training is provided as needed but occurs at least once every three years.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity:  Airgas keeps records of maintenance inspections of the equipment in anhydrous ammonia service to ensure proper and safe operations.  Process equipment that is regularly inspected includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, process controls and pumps.  Only qualified associates perform maintenance on the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.  Furthermore, maintenance associates are given specialized anhydrous ammonia safety training. \r\n Ammonia equipment deficiencies identified by maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change:  Change to the system or equipment components is managed in accordance with written procedure (Management of Change).  Associates who could be affected by a modification to the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system are promptly made aware of the changes.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:  Pre-startup safety reviews are used to validate construction, process equipment and operating and maintenance procedure changes prior to placing new or modified ammonia equipment into service.\r\n\r\nInternal Audits:  Airgas audits itself to ensure that provisions of the RMP rule and PSM standard are fully implemented.  These audits are conducted at least every three years and corrective measures are undertaken promptly.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:  Airgas promptly investigates incidents that potentially can lead to or result in a catastrophic release of"

Associates are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend process safety and procedural improvements.  Additionally, associates have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule and PSM standard, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.  Airgas and all plant associates and operators work hard to prevent accidental releases.\r\n \r\nContractors:  Occasionally the company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction or renovation activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of their safety performance is made.  Airgas informs contractors of potential anhydrous ammonia hazards and other potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the company's processes.  Contractors are also informed of procedures that must be followed for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n \r\nEmergency Response: A written Emergency Response Plan includes accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and covers all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.
