      "SummaryText": "Albaugh, Inc. is a manufacturer and formulator of generic farm chemicals. Included in our line of products is 2,4-D which has been used by farmers for weed control for over 40 years. Dimethylamine is used in the production of 2,4-D. We also produce a formulation of glyphosate. Glyphosate uses isopropylamine. Dimethylamine and isopropylamine are the only chemicals handled on this site that are included in the Risk Management Plan. We receive dimethylamine in railcars and tank trucks. We have a 15,000-gallon tank in our tankfarm in which we store dimethylamine as a 60% aqueous solution. We receive isopropylamine in railcars and have three 13,000-gallon storage tanks for 70% isopropylamine. Both chemicals are unloaded from railcars as anhydrous amines and are immediately diluted with water before storage.\n\nOur facility has had a very successful safety experience with no reportable incidents in the last 5 years. Albaugh, Inc. is committed to safety from the senior management level and throughout the company. Compliance with federal and state regulations is a priority. Several company safety programs are in place; Process Safety Management, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, Hazard Communication and Community Right-To-Know, Safety Committee, written emergency procedures, and employee training. Each new employee is given Right-To-Know training and is issued a copy of the safety rules. These programs combined with safe operating procedures, controls, and equipment contribute to the overall climate of safe working conditions.\n\nAlbaugh, Inc. plant is located on 32 acres of flat terrain in an industrial area of the community. We are located within the flood plain with a general slope from northeast to the southwest. Within the facility, a storm water drainage system manages water runoff. This system operates under an NPDES Permit issued by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) and required monitoring of the outflows from this system is done by mo"

There are several drainage systems that flow from the southeast to northwest across the facility, flowing in turn into a drainage system alongside the northwestern edge of the property. This system flows to the southwest and contains a containment basin with an emergency capacity of 40,000 gallons. The containment has a chamber where treatment chemicals or absorbent materials could be added in the event of a spill. A valve on the downstream side of the containment basin controls the flow through the basin. There are several valves upstream of the containment basin, and there is one valve downstream of the containment basin at the point where the drainage system leaves the property. After passing through the containment basin, surface water leaves the property at the western corner of the site and flows west to St. Joseph Light and Power where it surfaces. It continues to flow in a westerly direction, crosses a levee, and enters Brown\u00bfs Branch. Brown\u00bfs Branch flows northwest until it reaches the Missouri River. The area of the site that contains oil storage tanks is protected from the 100-year flood by a levee.\n\nWorst-case scenarios:\nFor the worst-case scenario we have used the vapor cloud explosion, which would be an explosion from a railcar being unloaded. Dimethylamine and isopropylamine have nearly identical properties when considering worst-case releases. Both scenarios resulted in identical distances to the endpoint of 1 psi overpressure. We have chosen to report the worst-case release for dimethylamine. The maximum quantity of chemical for this scenario was the contents of the largest railcar in which we would receive shipments. The model used was the EPA RMP*COMP. Using this model we found the endpoint would be 0.4 mile (2112 feet). There is no residential population within that boundary. There would be some impact on two neighboring manufacturing facilities one of which is approximately 500 feet to the north"

      "SummaryText": "and the other is 510 feet to the west from the location of the amine unloading and dilution process.\n\nAlternative Scenario:\nThe alternative scenario selected is a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) involving dimethylamine. The quantity involved in the explosion was assumed to be one-half of a full rail car, or 82,000 pounds. The rail car was assumed to burst at or above relief valve pressure. The equations in the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis guidance document were used to calculate the distance to the endpoint of 5 kW/m2 for 40 seconds. (The actual equivalent dose from this scenario was calculated to be 10.4 kW/m2 for 15 seconds.) The calculated distance to endpoint was 0.33 miles. This reaches a point offsite, but does not include any residential population, environmental receptors, or public receptors other than major commercial and industrial areas.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe facility operates under OSHA Process Safety Management. Additionally, the facility operates under a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC Plan). This plan outlines procedures for plant operations pertaining to oil products and by extension all other liquid chemical products handled at this facility. This plan covers operations pertaining to transfer, loading, unloading, piping, storage, and containment of liquid chemical products. The amine unloading area is dedicated specifically for that use. The amine dilution process is conducted in a building with special design features to reduce the probability of a release and to mitigate the potential effects of any release.\n\nEmergency Response:\nFacility personnel do not respond to emergency situations. They do clean up incidental spills of chemical products. The facility has coordinated its response actions with the local fire department. The fire department annually receives the facility EPCRA report.\n\nAccident History:\nDimethylamine has been used at this facility since 1972 and there have been"
