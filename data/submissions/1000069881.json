      "SummaryText": "Natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility via pipeline from several Central Production Facilities. The natural gas and associated liquids enter the facility through a pig trap and a multifinger slug catcher. Gas from the slug catcher is compressed by one of eight compressors, dehydrated by one of two glycol dehydration units, and a slip stream is sent to an amine unit to remove carbon dioxide before being sent to multiple sales points. The liquids from the slug catcher are routed to the liquids side of the process where any water is separated from the liquids and the liquids are stabilized in one of two stabilizer towers. The liquids flow through a caustic wash system to remove H2S, and a carbon filtration unit to treat the color (if needed) for pipeline quality purposes. The resulting NGL is then stored in pressurized bullet tanks prior to exiting the facility via pipeline or by truck (used during periods of pipeline shutdowns) to a third party gas plant for further processing.  Additionally Marathon processes stabilized NGL's received from a third party. These third party NGL's are hauled to the plant via truck. They are unloaded into a pressurized tank and then are introduced into the Marathon process and are commingled with Marathons production (described above). NGL's is considered hazardous by the EPA. Because NGL's are pressurized flammable gas, it is necessary to follow safety precautions during handling to prevent fire/explosion risks and reduce health threats to our workers and neighbors. Marathon has implemented various health and safety programs and processes and will strictly adhere to all Federal, State, and Local rules and regulations. \n\n\n\nSafety depends on:        \n\n(a) The manner in which we handle this product        \n\n(b) The safety devices inherent in the design of the facility        \n\n(c) Operating and maintenance procedures, and         \n\n(d) Employee training    \n\n\n\nMarathon Eagle Ford Asset Team's emergency response program details employee responsibilitie"
