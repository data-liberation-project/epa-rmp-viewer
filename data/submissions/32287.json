To achieve this end, Venoco strives to operate its facilities in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local safety, health, and environmental regulations.  \r\n\r\nVenoco implements its emergency response policies to comply with the overall corporate policy of providing its workers with a safe workplace and of minimizing risk to the public. The safety of emergency and non-affected personnel is the highest priority; therefore, all procedures must be implemented in the appropriate manner (e.g., safely executed rescue and medical activities).  Protection of the environment is also a high priority.  Once the issues of life, safety, and the environmental are addressed, the secondary issues of property conservation and business recovery may be considered.\r\n\r\n1.2 Facility Description\r\n\r\nThe Ellwood Onshore Facility is located west of Goleta in the southeast corner of Santa Barbara County, about 1,200 feet from the Pacific Ocean and approximately 2 miles south of the Santa Ynez Mountains. The elevation of the Treatment Plant site is about 20 feet above sea level.  The nearest earthquake faults are the Mesa-Rincon Creek Fault Zone, approximately 9 miles to the west and the More Ranch-Mission Ridge-Arroyo Parida Fault Zone, approximately 1/2-mile to the south.  Other local faults include the Santa Ynez Fault and the Los Alamos-Baseline Fault Zone. The approximate coordinates of the plant are longitude 119\u00b0 54' 42\" west and latitude 34\u00b0 25' 52\" north (coordinates were determined from the EPA Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) program that can be found at the link below).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.epa.gov/tri/report/siting_tool/index.htm\r\n \r\nThe facility is located in an open area as shown in Figure 1-1 at 7979 Hollister Avenue, Go"

The area is bounded on the north by the access road (Hollister Avenue extension), on the southwest by the Pacific Ocean, and on the east by the Sandpiper Golf Course and the west by Bacara Park and Haskell's Beach. The nearest major highway is U.S. Route 101, approximately 0.1 miles to the north.  The Southern-Pacific Railroad parallels U.S. Route 101.  \r\n\r\nA small residential area is located above Highway 101, about 0.35 miles northeast of the plant.  The Sandpiper Golf Course is adjacent to the site on the east, about 0.1 miles from the site boundary.  Bacara Park and Haskell's Beach are about 0.3-0.35 miles to the west of the facility.   These are considered public receptors under the RMP regulation.\r\n\r\nFigure 1-1.  Area Map\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimplified process flow diagrams of the gas separation plant, emulsion separation unit and vapor recovery unit are shown in Figures 1-2a, b and c.  The facility currently produces about 3,500 barrels per day of crude oil, 5 million cubic feet per day of sales gas, and 12,000 gallons per day of natural gas liquids (NGL) and mixed liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).  Sour field gas from the Holly offshore platform is chilled (using a propane refrigerant) to remove NGLs. Next, a glycol dehydration unit removes excess moisture from the gas and a gas-sweetening (LO-CAT) unit removes H2S from the gas prior to low temperature separation of LPG from the sales gas. Excess carbon dioxide in the sales gas is removed in a Grace membrane unit and the separated gas is used as fuel gas. The emulsion from the offshore platform is heated to remove produced water, which is disposed in an injection well. The separated crude oil is stripped to remove hydrogen sulfide and then sent via pipeline to the marine terminal. A vapor recovery unit is used to compress stripped hydrogen sulfide vapors stripped from the crude oil, which are then sweetened in the LO-CAT unit.\r\n\r\n1.3 Covered Processes and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Ellwood facility handles the follo"

Is the facility a stationary source?\r\n2. Are there any regulated substances handled?\r\n3. What processes handle regulated substances?\r\n4. Does any process contain more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance?\r\n\r\nThe first step is to determine if the site is considered to be a stationary source according to RMP paragraph 68.10. A \"stationary source\" is defined in paragraph 68.3. A key definition of a stationary source is that the process belongs to the same industrial group (i.e., SIC code). This is further defined in Chapter 1, Section 1.2 of the General Guidance for RMP document as \"operations at a site that belong to the same three-digit NAICS code prefix\".  All operations at Ellwood would fall under the three-digit NAICS code prefix of 211, Oil and Gas Extraction. \r\n\r\nThe liquid crude oil/water emulsion and field gas feeds to Ellwood are considered to be naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures, which are exempt from RMP under paragraph 68.115(b)(2)(iii) until the field gas enters a natural gas processing plant (NAICS code 211112) or the crude oil/water emulsion enters a petroleum refining process unit (NAICS code 32411). \r\n\r\nFigure 1-2a: Gas PFD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1-2b: Crude Oil PFD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1-2c: Vapor Recovery Unit PFD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRMP paragraph 68.3 provides the following definitions:\r\n\r\n\"Natural gas processing plant (gas plant) means any processing site engaged in the extraction of natural gas liquids from field gas, fractionation of mixed natural gas liquids to natural gas products or both\". \r\n\r\n\"Petroleum refining process unit means a process unit used in an establishment primarily engaged in petroleum refining as defined in NAICS code 32411 for petroleum refining and used for the following: Producing transport"

NGL is considered to be a covered flammable mixture because NGL contains more than one weight percent of ethane, propane, butane and pentane and NGL meets the criteria for an NFPA 4 rating per RMP paragraph 68.115(b)(2)(i). Chapter 1, Section 1.5 of the General Guidance for RMP document, provides the following definition for NFPA-4:\"Any liquid or gaseous material this is liquid while under pressure and has a flash point below 73 F (22.8 C) and a boiling point below 100F (37.8 C) (i.e., Class 1A flammable liquids)\".\r\n\r\nLPG is considered to be a covered flammable mixture because the LPG contains more than one weight percent of propane, butane and pentane and LPG meets the criteria for an NFPA 4 flammability rating.\r\n\r\nField gas is also considered to be a covered flammable mixture because the natural gas contains more than one weight percent of methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane and natural gas meets the criteria for an NFPA 4 flammability rating. In addition, sour gas meets the criteria for a toxic substance because it contains more than one weight percent of hydrogen sulfide.\r\n\r\nThe emulsion/crude oil is not covered because it is considered to be a naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixture prior to entry into a petroleum refining process unit. RMP paragraph 68.115 specifically defines naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures as including both crude oil and produced water, which are the products of the emulsion separation process.\r\n\r\nFuel gas is also considered as not covered per RMP paragraph 68.126, which states \"A flammable substance listed in Tables 3 and 4 of paragraph 68.130 is excluded from coverage when the substance is used as fuel at the source\".\r\n\r\nTable 1-1 provides the composition of the gas and gas liquids streams:"

Venoco has engineering and administrative controls to limit the maximum level in each tank to 33,000 gal (173,000 lb of NGL with a density of 5.25 lb per gallon and 139,000 lb. of LPG at a density of 4.2 lb per gallon). Since both NGL and LPG contain regulated flammable substances in excess of one weight percent, the entire contents of the mixture needs to be considered in determining the threshold quantity per RMP paragraph 68.115. Therefore, there is more than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs for either ethane, propane, butane or pentane.  (The quantity of methane in the gas processing equipment was not calculated, but I doubt it would exceed 10,000 lb in the process or the equivalent of about 225,000 SCF, however all equipment handling sour or sales gas should be included as part of the covered process because it is connected to the NGL and LPG processing equipment (see definition of a process in RMP paragraph 68.3) and is not specifically excluded. \r\n\r\nThe field gas contains up to 20,000 ppmv of hydrogen sulfide. Field gas is handled in V-203 Inlet Scrubber and V-119 Outlet Separator before entering the LO-CAT unit which removes hydrogen sulfide from the field gas.

This is far below the threshold quantity for hydrogen sulfide of 10,000 lbs and therefore does not need to be considered as a covered toxic substance.\r\n\r\nThe single covered process includes the sour field gas entering the facility, the NGL separation facilities, the sour gas sweetening and dehydration facilities, the LPG separation facilities, the NGL/LPG storage and truck loading facilities, the vapor recovery unit and the relief headers, thermal oxidizers and flare. Specifically excluded facilities include the oil emulsion heater treater, hydrogen sulfide stripper, crude surge tank and LACT unit, the produced water tank and the fuel gas system.\r\n\r\n1.4 Summary of Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Results\r\n\r\nThe OCA was performed with the RMP*Comp version 1.07 consequence analysis program. The nearest public receptors are about 0.1 mile away.  The estimated residential population that could be impacted by releases is approximately 95 for the worst-case scenario and less than one for the alternate-case scenario, based on 2000 Census data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\r\n\r\n1.4.1 Worst-Case Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release for flammables, as defined in the regulation, is a release of flammable materials resulting in a vapor cloud explosion of the maximum inventory of the largest vessel.  Even though the normal operating inventory for this equipment is less than the maximum capacity, and this equipment is protected by a high-level alarm (at 33,000 gal), pressure relief valves, periodic inspections, and routine monitoring by operating personnel, this maximum inventory must be assumed to be released instantaneously and ignited at the point of release.  \r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario modeled for the facility is a sudden release of the entire volume of the flammable material stored in V-227"

However, since NGL has a higher density than LPG (5.25 vs. 4.2 lb per gallon), the same volume of 33,000 gallons would amount to 173,000 lb of NGL and 139,000 lb of LPG. Therefore, the OCA assumes a worst-case catastrophic (instantaneous) release of the NGL in V-227.\r\n\r\nThe location of the facility was mapped and measured with respect to nearby public receptors.  The nearest public receptors are is the Sandpiper Golf Course approximately 0.1 mile to the east of the facility, U.S. Route 101 approximately 0.1 mile to the north of the facility, the small residential area approximately 0.35 miles northeast of the facility, and Bacara Park and Haskell's Beach about 0.3-0.35 miles to the west of the facility.\r\n1.4.2 Alternate-Case Scenario\r\n\r\nThe alternate-case release scenario for flammables is a 10-minute release from rupture of a LPG loading hose. In table B-1 of the RMP Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities, rupture of a two-inch liquid propane line would result in a two-phase release of 2050 lb per min or 20,500 lb in 10 min. The LPG produced at Ellwood is primarily propane.\r\n\r\nThe alternate-case release scenario also identified off-site impacts, but the impact area includes minimal public receptors.  For the alternate-case vapor cloud explosion, the estimated distance to 1-psi overpressure is approximately 0.1 miles.  This endpoint zone includes part of the Sandpiper Golf Course and part of Bacara Park.\r\n\r\n1.5 Summary of Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nFinally, the program level for the process needs to be determined. Based on the results of the offsite consequence analysis, the distance to the flammable endpoint for the worst-case release exceeds the distance to the nearest public receptor (the Sandpiper Golf Course and US Highway 101, each of which is about 0.1 miles from the facility boundary). Therefore according to RMP paragraph 68.10, the covered process is not eligible for Program 1 requirements."

Therefore, the gas-processing unit meets the Program 3 eligibility requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being subject to EPA RMP requirements the Ellwood Onshore Facility is subject to the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) Process Safety Management Program (PSM).  Through compliance with the PSM standard (with minor additions), the Ellwood Onshore Facility has implemented the requirements of the Program 3 prevention program.  \r\n\r\nCompliance with PSM's comprehensive program ensures the integrity of the processes that handle flammable or toxic materials.  The objective of the PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals.   To control these types of hazards, Venoco has developed the necessary expertise, experiences, judgment and proactive initiative within their workforce to properly implement and maintain an effective PSM program.  An effective PSM program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole chemical process. Using this approach the following components were considered in the evaluation:  1) the process design; 2) process technology; 3) process changes; 4) operational and maintenance activities and procedures; 5) non-routine activities and procedures; 6) emergency preparedness plans and procedures; 7) training programs; and 8) other elements that affect the process.  The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals have been evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level.
