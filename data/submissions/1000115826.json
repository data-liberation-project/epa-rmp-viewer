The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment. The Dallas Water Utilities Central Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel will coordinate with local emergency response agencies and first responders to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n2.0 Description of The Dallas Water Utilities Central Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Dallas Water Utilities Central Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. These substances are:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in railcars and a bulk tank and used for disinfection of the water.\n* Sulfur dioxide- stored in bulk tanks and used for dechlorination of water.\n\n3.0 Hazard Assessment\n\nThe RMP Rule requires The Dallas Water Utilities Central Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility. This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances sulfur dioxide and chlorine used in the disinfection and dechlorination of effluent at the facility.
