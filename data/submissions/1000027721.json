As part of this commitment, KMTEX has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One part of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at KMTEX and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements; Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan)describing the risk management program at KMTEX. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at KMTEX. \n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nKMTEX is committed to the safety of KMTEX workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. KMTEX implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained Emergency Response personnel will respond to control and contain such releases. KMTEX evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and contacts the local fire department to control and contain the release and to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release. \n\n\n\n1.2 KMTEX and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nKMTEX may at times handle sufficient quantities of a substance to be covered by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nSubstance that may be covered under this rule are:\n\n\n\n* vinyl acetate\n\n\n\nThe process for which vinyl acetate may be involved includes:\n\n\n\n* An vinyl acetate distillation to remove impurities.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the potential use of regulated substances at KMTEX the following processes a"

The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCSs) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs). KMTEX does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like KMTEX. These scenarios are available to KMTEX employees and the public. If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP coordinator at (409) 985-4200.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects should be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\n\n\n* When considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would not experience any long-term health consequences, although some short-term consequences (e.g. strong eye, skin or throat irritation, shortness of breath,and dizziness) are likely. Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenarios:\n\n\n\n* vinyl acetate\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is a failure of the 433,000-gallon vinyl acetate storage tank in the tank farm resulting in a release of vinyl acetate over a 10-minute period. Administrative controls limit the quantity of vinyl acetate in the tank to 420,000 gal. This facility is not located in a populated area; however, the toxic cloud formed by the"

The toxic cloud formed form this release will travel 0.4 miles. This facility is not located in a populated area; therefore, the toxic cloud formed by the release will reach a limited number of offsite public and/or environmental receptors.\n\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the KMTEX plant. The EPA regulates \n\nprocesses at the KMTEX plant; therefore, RMP regulations are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health \n\nAdministration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nKMTEX encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the KMTEX plant accident prevention program. \n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nKMTEX keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \n\n\n\nKMTEX also maintains documents that p"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate \n\ncontrols are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nHAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are\n\nconducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings and/or action items are forwarded to appropriate personnel. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nThese periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are also documented and retained. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nKMTEX maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.

New employees receive basic training in KMTEX plant operations. New operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through test, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are deemed a \"qualified\" operator and can work independently.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nKMTEX uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, KMTEX has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform KMTEX plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nKMTEX conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nKMTEX has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a MOC will be distributed to appropriate personnel to review the use of equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\n\n\nKMTEX has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) a permit and procedure for ensuring operating personnel have knowledge of all work performed in their area of responsibility (i.e. safe work permits), (2) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (3) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure \n\nisolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (4) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (5) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (6) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nKMTEX has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe processes at KMTEX have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The prevention program \n\nsummarized previously is applied to all Program 2 and 3 EPA RMP -covered processes at KMTEX.  Collectively these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, KMTEX has safety features on many units to help \n\n(1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detec"

KMTEX workers will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effect (e.g., small fires or small leaks). In the event of a larger fire or release, workers evacuate the area and contact the local fire department.\n\n\n\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nKMTEX strives to improve the safety of KMTEX processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers. KMTEX resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the process. \n\n\n\n"
