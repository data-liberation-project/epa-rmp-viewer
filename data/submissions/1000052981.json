The products covered in our Risk Management Plan for this facility is aqua ammonia solution >20% concentration (NOT anhydrous ammonia).  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program:  Accident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping, manufacturing and storage.  This starts with delivery of aqua ammonia solution in DOT approved tank-trailers and then transferring the product into a 12,971 gallon, carbon steel storage container.  Unloading of the product from the trailer to the storage tank is conducted in a containment area that is designed to catch any accidental spills.  The storage tank is located in a containment basin and is equipped with high level indicators to help prevent accidental overflow.  Prevention continues by having employees trained in proper handling procedures and using unloading checklists.  Employees are also equipped with proper personnel protective equipment to safely store raw materials and manufacture and package additives for customer delivery.  Adherence to OSHA workplace rules is just another part of our safety program.  We also follow industry standards, such as those of the National Association of Chemical Distributors to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History:  As a result of our diligence, there has not been an accidental release from ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at this facility since the start-up of operations. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response:  In the event of an aqua ammonia solution release, Hawkins employees are trained to investigate the situation and if needed:\r\n1.
