The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Vessels\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessels is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receivers. The liquid transfer vessels receive liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessels reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessels to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain, by gravity, into the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessels can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. Each compressor has an integral oil separator that receives the high pressure vapor and separates residual oil from the ammonia so that the oil can be returned to the compressor. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint.

Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nFlooded Accumulators\r\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from a flooded accumulator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. The liquid ammonia enters the bottom of the evaporator coil and as the liquid boils into a vapor, it rises through the coil and returns to the flood accumulator. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulator\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors.

Nevertheless, Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\nFor the future, Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document. It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Vignolo Delmart Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.  \r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nVignolo Delmart Cold Storage's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\nCalifornia Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\nFederal Emergency Action Plan - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility.
