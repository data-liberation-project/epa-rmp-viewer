Three pumps, two with capacities of 1400 gallons per\nminute (gpm) and one with a capacity of 2800 gpm, deliver the\nraw water from the wet well through a transmission line to the\nwater treatment plant.  Water qualities for the Red Lake River\nunder extreme conditions are shown below:\n\n\nRed Lake River      Turbidity                                     6-900 \n                              TOC (mg/l)                                    9-25 \n                              Temperature                           0.5-25.0 \n                              pH                                             7.6-8.3 \n                              Hardness (mg/l as CaCO3)     130-440 \n\n\nThe high turbidity and hardness of the source force the plant to\nuse aluminum sulfate (alum) coagulation, lime/soda ash\nsoftening, and rapid-rate dual media filtration year round in\norder to produce a suitable quality of drinking water.\n\nTreatment Plant\n\nThe East Grand Forks Water Treatment Plant is a rapid rate, dual\nmedia filtration plant with solids enhanced pretreatment, solids\nenhanced lime/soda ash softening, fluoridation, stabilization,\nchlorination, and chloramine disinfection.\n\nThe East Grand Forks Water Treatment Plant has a maximum\ntreatment capacity of 2780 gpm which corresponds to\napproximately 4 million gallons per day (MGD).  To meet consumer\ndemands, the East Grand Forks Water Treatment Plant at times\noperates its maximum treatment capacity during the summer and\nwinter for an operating period of 16 to 24 hours per day.\n\nTreatment at the plant begins in the influent line to the\npretreatment basin, where alum is added as a coagulant to help\nremove turbidity and color from the raw water, potassium\npermanganate or carbon is added for taste and odor control and a\ncationic polymer is added seasonally to aid in the settling\nproc"

At this point in the treatment process, poly\nphosphate is also added to stabilize the water (limited\ncorrosion inhibition is also provided by the poly phosphate) and\nfluoride is added for dental health purposes.\n\nFiltration of the softened and recarbonated water is performed\nin two double bay, dual media filters.  The media in the filters\nconsists of 12 inches of anthracite, 12 inches of sand, and 16\ninches of various grades of gravel below the sand and anthracite\nfor support.  The filters at the East Grand Forks Water\nTreatment Plant are loaded at approximately 2.0 gal/min/ft2. \nThe filters are backwashed on a regular basis and the filter\nbackwash water is held in a storage basin before being pumped to\nthe sanitary sewer.\n\nStorage at the East Grand Forks Water Treatment Plant consists\nof a 129,000 gallon clearwell and a 1,000,000 gallon finished\nwater reservoir (FWR).  Water is pumped, using transfer pumps,\nfrom the clearwell to the FWR by two 1400 gpm and one 2800 gpm\ncentrifugal pumps.
