      "SummaryText": "The following provides a brief summary of the key components of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program for the aqueous ammonia storage and handlign system at W.A. Parish Electric Generating Station.\n\n\n\nGeneral Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nW.A. Parish Electric Generating Station is located in Thompsons, Texas.  The facility is a 3,800-MW electric generation facility consisting of eight steam electric generating units and a carbon capture unit with an associated combustion turbine.  A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system is associated with the each of the four coal-fired units and the combustion turbine.  The SCRs employ aqueous ammonia injection technology to control emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx).  Aqueous ammonia is classified as a toxic chemical subject to the requirements of the RMP Program.  The aqueous ammonia used in these SCR systems is an approximately 30% solution of ammonia in water.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia storage and handling system at W.A. Parish is comprised of storage tanks, transfer pumps, and piping which terminate at the vaporizer for each unit where the aqueous ammonia is atomized and vaporized.  The four tanks each have a capacity of 80,000 gallons but are administratively limited to holding 76,000 gallons.  Each tank is equipped with a presure relief valve, a vacuum breaker valve with flame arrestor, and liquid level indicators.\n\n\n\nAll other regulated substances onsite are below applicable thresholds for RMP.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases from the aqueous ammonia storage and handling.\n\n\n\nSummary of Prevention Program 2\n\n\n\nW.A. Parish is covered by an accidental release prevention program, which includes the following:\n\n-Periodic hazard review and updates\n\n-Periodic audits of the system and its operation\n\n-Emergency response plan coordinated with local resonding agencies\n\n\n\nThe aqueous ammonia storage and handling system prevention program includes the following components:\n\n"

W.A. Parish employees have been trained in this plan and would be the first responders in the event of an emergency.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nA hazard review of the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at W.A. Parish was conducted as part of this RMP.  There are not any planned changes to the system at this time.\n\n\n\n"
