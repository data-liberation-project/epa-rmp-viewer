      "SummaryText": "eration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the reportable quantity of 100 pounds within the last five years (August 2021 - August 2016). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\n\n- save lives;\n\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\n\n- protect the environment; and\n\n- minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nSince facility personnel will not respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency evacuation procedures.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe original Process Hazard Analysis, performed on August 22 & 23, 2006, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. facility located in York, Pennsylvania.  The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance-related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures.  The C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - York safety committee completed these recommendations as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees"
