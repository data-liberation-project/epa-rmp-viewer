              "Description": "40 CFR 68.155(b) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled \n\n\n\nTerry Bundy Generating Station is equipped with three landfill gas fired generators rated at 2,242 brake horsepower (1600ekW) and three LM 6000 dual fuel aeroderivative combustion turbines one of which operates in simple cycle, and two operate in either simple cycle or combined cycle with a steam turbine.  The LM 6000 turbines are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx emission control.  This system uses anhydrous ammonia which is fed into the exhaust combustion gases upstream of the SCR catalyst modules.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon or 60,000 pound pressure vessel under ambient temperature. As a result of the  85% maximum fill level the amount of ammonia stored in the pressure vessel is 10,200 gallons or 58,038 pounds.  \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(c) The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario\n\n\n\nUnder the Risk Management Program, an offisite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of a regulated substance.  In Terry Bundy Generating Station's case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance.  Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia are required for offsite consequence analysis under Program 2.\n\n\n\nA worst-case release scenario reflects the entire quantity of ammonia at Terry Bundy that can be stored or processed in a vessel at any one time.   By contrast an alternative release scenario reflects a release more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and that reaches an endpoint offsite.\n\n\n\nOff-site movement and dispersion of anhydrous ammonia in the atmosphere was predicted using the RMP*Comp computer model which is a free program used to complete the Off-site Consequence Analyses (both worst case scenarios and alternative scenarios) required under the Risk Management Program rule.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario selected for the Terry Bundy Generating Station was the loss of 58,038 pounds of anhydrous ammonia representing a complete failure of the pressure vessel being released to atmosphere within 10 minutes at a 5,800 lbs/min release rate.  Modeling results show that the worst-case scenario would have an offsite toxic endpoint of 4.4 miles.  The toxic endpoint is defined as the point where the ammonia concentration is below the level of concern, which is 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm. This 200 ppm value for a toxic endpoint is the same as the Emergency Response Planning Guide level 2 (ERPG-2) threshold. ERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario selected for the Terry Bundy Generating Station reflects a split in the unloading hose. This scenario results in 4,552 lbs of ammonia being released to atmosphere in the 5 minutes it takes to isolate the hose and stop the leak. Release rate is 910.4 lbs/min. Modeling results show that the alternative release scenario would have an offsite toxic endpoint of 0.6 miles where the ammonia concentration drops below the level of concern of 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm.\n\n    \n\n40 CFR 68.155(d) The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nTerry Bundy Generating Station has a Release Prevention Program in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at this facility.  The Release Prevention Program includes:\n\n\n\n?    Safety Information (SI)\n\n    LES develops and keeps current working copies of SI documentation including information pertaining to hazards of the process, the technology of the process and the equipment of the process.  This information is used to inform both employees and contractors.\n\n\n\n?    Hazard Review (HR)\n\nLES is committed to performing HR to identify, evaluate and control hazards associated with Terry Bundy Generating Station's operation and to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.50.\n\n\n\n?    Operating Procedures (OPs)\n\nTerry Bundy Generating Station has developed OPs as required and keeps them current.\n\n\n\n?    Training\n\nLES is committed to providing employees with comprehensive training to assure that the workforce can perform their duties safely, efficiently and effectively.\n\n\n\n?    Maintenance\n\nLES has developed a maintenance program for the ammonia system at Terry Bundy Generating Station.  The maintenance program includes pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems and ancillary equipment, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance procedures are developed or promulgated by equipment vendors, federal or state regulations, or industry codes.\n\n\n\n?    Incident Investigation\n\nThe LES Emergency Ammonia Release Response Plan for Terry Bundy Generating Station has well defined incident reporting and investigation procedures.  Responsibilities, titles and phone numbers are provided therein.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 668.155(e) The Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the submission of a Risk Management Program.  The five-year accident history would cover:\n\n\n\n?    A release of anhydrous ammonia from Terry Bundy Generating Station that caused at least one of the following:\n\n1.    Onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (40 CFR part 68.42(a)); or\n\n2.    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (40 CFR part 68.42(a)).\n\n\n\nThe Terry Bundy Generating Station has had no releases that conform with accidental release requirements that caused death, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either on or off site.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(f) The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nLES has a detailed Emergency Ammonia Release Response Plan designated specifically for an ammonia release for Terry Bundy Generating Station.  The plan is reviewed with response organizations on a routine basis.\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(g) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nLES will follow up on all of the recommendations of the Risk Management Program in a timely manner.  Any recommendations resulting from the revalidation of the Risk Management Program in the future will be dealt with in the same manner.\n\n",
