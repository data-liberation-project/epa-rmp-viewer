LES is a publicly owned electric utility with sole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska.  As a publicly owned utility, LES operates and maintains all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with the expectations of LES customer/owner's.  LES strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\n\n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of LES business practices and by maintaining this Risk Management Program LES is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it.  LES is committed to the accidental release prevention program and also maintains a detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for the Terry Bundy Generating Station.  The plan is routinely reviewed with HazMat responder organizations.  \n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.155(b) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled \n\n\n\nTerry Bundy Generating Station is equipped with three landfill gas fired generators rated at 2,242 brake horsepower (1600ekW) and three LM 6000 dual fuel aeroderivative combustion turbines one of which operates in simple cycle, and two operate in either simple cycle or combined cycle with a steam turbine.  The LM 6000 turbines are equipped with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx emission control.  This system uses anhydrous ammonia which is fed into the exhaust combustion gases upstream of the SCR catalyst modules.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 12,000 gallon or 60,000 pound pressure vessel under ambient temperature. As a result of an 85% maximum fill level "
