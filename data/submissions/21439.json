This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Coastal policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCoastal owns and operates Napoleonville Liquid Storage facility located in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Napoleonville Liquid Storage is a natural gas liquids storage facility that receives propane or butanes and raw make by pipeline.  The site consists of product storage equipment.  Products are transported from the facility via pipeline.\n\nNapoleonville Liquid Storage was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Coastal identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.\n\nThe listed flammable substances that are stored above threshold quantities at Napoleonville Liquid Storage are raw make and propane.  Based on worst-case analysis, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  In addition, Napoleonville Liquid Storage is subject to OSHA PSM. Therefore, Napoleonville Liquid Storage is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances - Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requir"

      "SummaryText": "ement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25(a)(2)(iii), an additional worst-case release scenario was analyzed since potentially affected public receptors differ between the listed flammable substances evaluated.  The worst-case flammable release for the propane has a 0.67-mile distance to the endpoint.  The worst-case flammable release for raw make has a 0.57-mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for raw make as follows.  A product pump seal failure during transfer operations causes a release from a one-inch opening.  The pump operates at 1,600 psig (discharge pressure) and 82\u00b0F.  The release is assumed to continue for 10 minutes.  The discharge raw make will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.  The distance to 1 psi overpressure for the alternative-case release of raw make using the EPA equations was calculated.  The gas factor used in these equations was from the components (n-butane and isobutane) representing the heaviest gas components of the mixture. The alternative-case release of raw make resulted in a 0.21-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint.  \n\nToxic Substances\n\nNapoleonville Liquid Storage does not have any toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-release scenarios for toxic substances is not require"

      "SummaryText": "ce to manage these hazards.\n\nNapoleonville Liquid Storage primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nNapoleonville Liquid Storage maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced op"

Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of Napoleonville Liquid Storage's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n\nNapoleonville Liquid Storage strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include a Health, Safety & Environmental Team (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, Behavioral Based Safety Programs and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nNapoleonville Liquid Storage actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with"

The process safety information will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  PSI is under continual development.\n\nNapoleonville Liquid Storage keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.
