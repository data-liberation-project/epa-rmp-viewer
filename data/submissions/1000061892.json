One is in operation and one is for backup. The other two are replacement cylinders.  The facility is staffed 17-hours a day and operators check the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) is stored in a container on the wall of the office building approximately 75 feet northeast of the chlorine storage area.\r\n\r\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario, estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of the chlorine to the air. The 2,000 pounds worst-case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by a single vessel. The RMP*Comp32 results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine is 1.3 miles. The total potentially affected population with the entire area of the circle is estimated at 12,000 persons. \r\n\r\nOne alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis. The scenario selected involves the failure of the regulator connections.  This failure results in the release of the entire contents of a container over a period of 15 minutes. This is equivalent to a release rate of 133 pounds of chlorine per minute. The RMP*Comp32 dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.2 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 15 minute release of 133 pounds of chlorine per minute. The total potentially affected population within the entire area of the circle is estimated at 340. \r\nA search of U.S. Geological Survey m"

Employees of private contractors are subject to Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations [29 CFR 1910.119: Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals]. This OSHA regulation contains requirements for preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. These releases may result in toxic, fire or explosion hazards.\r\n\r\nThe City of Mercedes, Hidalgo County, Texas, contracts the operation of the facility to CH2M HILL OMI. Therefore it must operate as a Prevention Program 3. This update includes Process Safety Management as required by OSHA. Jose Ramos, a Project Manager for CH2M, is the responsible official at the facility. \r\n\r\nThis four-part report presents the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) for the Mercedes Water Treatment Plant prepared by Ambiotec Environmental Consultants on behalf of the City of Mercedes.\r\n\r\nThe Mercedes Water Treatment Plant is located at 208 South Illinois Ave., Mercedes, Hidalgo County, Texas 78570, at north 26.148611 latitude and west -97.910556 longitude"

Environmental receptors include natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas.\r\n\r\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at this facility. \r\n\r\nThe Mercedes Water Treatment Plant Accidental Release Prevention Policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program 3 requirements and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. \r\n\r\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) that operators don during connection/disconnection of chlorine, and staff awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine. Mercedes Water Treatment Plant personnel employed the HAZOP technique to conduct a Process Hazard Analysis. They discussed each question and recorded their answers. After answering the questions, they discussed the adequacy of the existing safeguards and recommendations for additional safeguards. The staff finished the Process Hazard Analysis with an equipment inspection. All equipment was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis. The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated at least once every five years.  \r\n\r\nMercedes Water Treatment Plant ensures that each employee presently operating the process, and each employee newly assigned to these processes have been trained or tested successfully in the operating procedures listed above that pertain to their duties.
