In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work\n\nwith our Local Fire Company(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending\n\non the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Information:\n\n\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 422510, \"establishments primarily engaged in operating country or terminal\n\ngrain elevators,\" however we are also engaged in providing \"agricultural inputs\" that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area. The NAICS code we feel most applicable for receiving, storing, and\n\nreloading Anhydrous Ammonia is #493130 \"farm product warehousing and storage.\" Although Anhydrous Ammonia is the only\n\nproduct subject to the EPA Risk Management Plan at this time, it should be noted that we also handle propane for both agricultural\n\nuses and home heating, which is under consideration as a listed substance. We include propane (as well as all crop protectants\n\nand petroleum products) in our planning, training, and maintenance programs, however only the Anhydrous Ammonia facilities will\n\nbe included in this report.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months.\n\nDuring the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs.

Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the\n\nyear. Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program:\n\n\n\nOur Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute,\n\nInc.(ANSI) standard K-61.1\"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\" We conduct\n\nannual employee training on the safe handling, transportation, and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety\n\nequipment including, but not limited to :Excess flow valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to\n\nprevent tampering when the site is unattended. We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency\n\nresponse personnel; and have provided and /or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia. We have\n\ndeveloped an Emergency Action initiates evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our\n\ncompany including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan. The primary emergency coordinator is listed in the\n\nRegistration Section of this document. If this individual is unavailable you may contact either of the individuals listed below:\n\n\n"
