      "SummaryText": "A. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nWawona Frozen Foods is located in Clovis, California, and utilizes refrigeration for cold storage and freezing of peaches, nectarines, plums, and strawberries.\n\nSenior management at the facilities are not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administer the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\nWawona Frozen Foods has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Wawona Frozen Foods to evacuate the production employees and to allow the HazMat team to respond to the emergency.  If an ammonia release involved could potentially impact the local community, a Community Notification Plan would be activated.  This plan has been developed and implemented with input from local fire, police, and medical officials.  If an ammonia release were to extend into the neighboring community, a Shelter-In-Place plan would go into effect.\n\nThe refrigeration systems are closed loop systems similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nWawona Frozen Foods maintains three separate ammonia refrigeration systems that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  Each system has a low pressure or low side, where the refrigerant absorbs heat as it evaporates, and a high pressure or high side, where the refrigerant vapor gives off heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.

      "SummaryText": "peration the system basically moves heat from the low side to the high side.)  Refrigeration is maintained by isolating the low side in some form of insulated enclosure where goods are chilled or frozen.  \n\nThe Main System Engine Room serves Freezers 1 through 6, 8, and 9.  The Northwest Refrigeration System is connected with the Main System Engine Room and serves Freezer Boxes 10 and 11.  The Main System Engine Room and the Northwest Refrigeration System use a combined total of 11,000 pounds of ammonia.  The Chiller/IQF Refrigeration System serves a water chiller and 2 IQF lines, and uses a total of 10,500 pounds of ammonia.  The Spiral Refrigeration System serves the spiral freezer, and uses a total of 4,600 pounds of ammonia. The Spiral Refrigeration System is not subject to the RMP rule, as it contains less than the threshold quantity of ammonia.  However, the RMP elements will be implemented facility wide.  There is a total of 26,100 pounds of ammonia in the three refrigeration systems.\n\nC.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Wawona Frozen Foods ammonia refrigeration systems have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\nThe Process Safety Management program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff are trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  All refrigeration equipment and ammonia vessels are equipped with automatic pressure safety relief devices to prevent pressure build-up beyond safe equipment operation levels.  A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, ageing, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are tested regularly to ensure proper o"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe five year accident history investigation (October 2001 to October 2006) revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.  \n\nE.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Action Plan was designed to ensure a safe and healthful working environment.  The policy at Wawona Frozen Foods is to identify and correct unsafe conditions and work practices before an incident can occur.  The Emergency Action Plan outlines the company safety policy, responsibilities, accident investigation, and proper safety training procedures required to provide a safe work place.  \n\nWawona Frozen Foods' Emergency Action Plan is outlined in the PSM/RMP documentation and the IIPP and focuses on responding to ammonia releases.\n\nResponse Organization and Notification Procedures \nIn the event of an accident, the operator should immediately notify his supervisor.  During the first few moments of the event, the witness should assess the situation as follows:\n\n1) How severe is the problem?\n2) Is there any personnel in danger?\n3) What is running at the time?\n4) Where is the leak source?\n5) What can be done about the leak?\n6) Has the hazard communication process been initiated?\n\nIf the operator was able to extinguish the emergency, then the accident investigator should be notified.  The accident investigator then proceeds to consider several questions as to the incidents surrounding the emergency.  The questions are numerous and include finding out key elements as to the occurrence of the accident.  Some key questions include the following:  \n\n1) Who was involved?  \n2) What was the accident? \n3) When did it occur? \n4) Why did the operator react the way he did? \n5) Where did the accident occur? How did he get injured? \n6) How could this be avoided in the future?\n\nEvacuation Routes and Procedures\nIn the e"

This is upwind of the release and typically at the northeast corner of the facility.  \n\nMitigation Measures\nA group response team will be established to assess the situation and be available to assist the Fire Department.  Certain trained personnel are authorized to shut down the ammonia refrigeration system while exiting the area.  SCBAs are maintained and personnel are trained for response with assistance from the Fire Department.\n\nF.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWawona Frozen Foods is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP/CalARP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP/CalARP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.  Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
