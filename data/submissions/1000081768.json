      "SummaryText": "Pilkington NA, Inc. (PNA) owns and operates a flat glass manufacturing facility (EPA Facility ID# 1000 0004 3366) located on Highway 74 East in Laurinburg, North Carolina.  Highway 1611, Business Highway 74, and the Shoe Heel Creek border the facility.  The facility, which produces automotive and commercial building glass (NAICS 327211), sits on approximately 430 acres and operates 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  Pilkington employees approximately 325 people from the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to 40 CFR Part 68 Risk Management Program (RMP) rule for the flammable chemical hydrogen due to on-site storage quantities in excess of the RMP regulatory limit of 10,000 pounds for all flammables.  Hydrogen is stored onsite in a tank.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, PNA is subject to the regulations for a toxic substance/compound above the threshold quantity in a process that has been categorized as Confidential Business Information (CBI) under 40 CFR 68.151.  Henceforth this compound will be referred to as CBI_1.\r\n\r\nThe facility has worked diligently to maintain a safe environment for their employees and the surrounding community. There have been no reportable accidents involving RMP-related substances during the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe facility currently maintains emergency response activities in an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP). The facility has trained its employees on response actions and has coordinated response activities with the Scotland County Emergency Coordinator, who heads the Local Emergency Planning Committee."
