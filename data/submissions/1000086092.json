Inc., owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Taylorsville, Mississippi which is referenced as the plant or facility. The facility is located on 13136 Highway 28 West.  It is adjacent to a Georgia-Pacific Plywood mill.  A Georgia-Pacific Stud Mill and Roseburg Particleboard plant are also within the same manufacturing complex. The resin facility consists of three plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1972, a plant that manufactures formaldehyde that was originally constructed in 1973 (formaldehyde is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins), and a spray-dry resin plant that was constructed in 1996.  Overall, the facility employs 58 full-time employees.\r\n\r\nBakelite Chemicals LLC is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Bakelite Chemicals LLC has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\r\n\r\nThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\r\n\u00b7A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regu"

In fact, the Plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nBakelite Chemicals LLC limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the Plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, Bakelite Chemicals LLC considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nBakelite Chemicals LLC prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \r\n\r\nBakelite Chemicals LLC limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  Bakelite Chemicals LLC trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.

Bakelite Chemicals LLC implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant makes every effort to control and contain any release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  Bakelite Chemicals LLC provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  In order to effectively implement these policies, Bakelite Chemicals LLC established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2  Regulated Substances\r\nThe plant handles two (2) regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule; Formaldehyde Solution and Ammonia Solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nSince 1972, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\r\n\r\n1.3.1.11   Hot Work Permits - The Plant established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plant's safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\n1.3.1.12   Contractors - The Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plant's safe work practices, and the plant's emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.

The ammonia vendor supplies ammonia solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the ammonia storage tank.  The storage tank's design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving ammonia receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for ammonia developed by the plant.   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde solution-Industry standards are followed at the plant to help ensure safe handling of formaldehyde.  Most of the formaldehyde stored in the plant's storage vessels is piped directly from the formaldehyde plant.  However, to make-up for shortfalls in formaldehyde production, some formaldehyde is delivered to the plant by offsite vendors. The formaldehyde vendor supplies formaldehyde solution via a DOT approved tank truck and follows DOT standards when loading the formaldehyde storage tanks.  The storage tanks' design and construction are consistent with ANSI standards.  Workers who perform operations involving formaldehyde receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures for formaldehyde developed by the plant.   The storage tanks are surrounded by a concrete dike which is large enough to contain 100% of the volume of the largest tank should its entire contents be spilled.  All air emissions from the storage tanks are directed to an oxidizer, which destroys in excess of 98% of the formaldehyde emissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\r\nThe plant has completed a review of the five-year accident history for the plant.
