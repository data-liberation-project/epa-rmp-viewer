All applicable procedures of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to.\r\n\r\nB. Southern Water Treatment is a company devoted to the manufacture of quality products that are used throughout the Americas to remove metals from waste water. The facility is located on White Horse Road in Greenville, South Carolina. The facility includes a warehouse and storage area, laboratory, production areas, and offices and administration areas. The RMP covered materials used at SWT are Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine. The facility is staffed from 7:30 am until 5:00 pm. Monday through Friday. All other times, designated personnel are available by 24 hour cell phone coverage to respond to any alarms which may occur.\r\n\r\nC. The offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \u00bfworst case\u00bf and \u00bfalternative scenario\u00bf.  The first scenario is defined by the EPA, which states that the \u00bfowner operator shall assume that the [maximum quantity in the largest vessel] is released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00bf due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \u00bfmore likely to occur\u00bf.  SWT\u00bfs alternative scenario involves Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine. \r\n\r\nD. The model that Southern Water Treatment used was the EPA\u00bfs RMP Comp model. The model used atmospheric dispersion modeling to determine the distance traveled by the Carbon Disulfide and Dimethylamine released before the concentration of the material decreases to the toxic endpoint. The worst case scenario involves a liquid spill and vaporization of carbon disulfide released in the maximum quantity possible 504 lbs / min, and Dimethylamine liquefied under pressure released at the maximum quantity from the vessel. Mitigation measures considered is a diked area of 1615 square feet, which will"

The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has been defined, \u00bfto estimate the population potentially affected\u00bf.\r\n\r\nE. The general Southern Water Treatment Risk Management Program is based on the following key elements:\r\n\r\n    1. Operator Training\r\n    2. Preventative Maintenance\r\n    3. Safety Equipment\r\n    4. Safety Training\r\n    5. Operating Procedure Training\r\n    6. Job Hazard Analysis\r\n    7. Audit and Inspection Program\r\n    8.
