      "SummaryText": "Aqua Pennsylvania owns and operates the Roaring Creek Water Filtration Plant in Elysburg, PA which provides potable water for the surrounding community. The company is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all its employees. The Corporate Mission is to continue in a leadership role as a good corporate citizen and encourage employees' active participation in the communities served. The Roaring Creek Water Filtration Plant conducts a safe, productive business, contributing to the community while minimizing risk to employees and neighbors.\n\nThe Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program. A management Team, consisting of qualified management personnel located onsite and at Corporate Headquarters, is accountable for enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the release prevention program. \n\nEmergency Response to any potential incident at the plant is accomplished in accordance with the site's Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan identifies response capabilities and qualification requirements of the onsite Emergency Response Team. The Plan complies with the emergency response requirements of OSHA, EPA, and PADEP. The Plan is tested annually for effectiveness. \n\nThe Roaring Creek Water Filtration Plant has installed detection systems that will effectively notify management of any chlorine release that could occur at the facility. In addition to the detectors, the facility uses alarms, isolation valves and a scrubber system to further minimize the risk associated with accidental releases. \n\nAs an indication of the effectiveness of the above-mentioned programs, the site has experienced no accidental releases within the past five years. An accidental release is defined as any release that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental change."
