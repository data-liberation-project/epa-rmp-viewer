General Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Indian River Generating Station located in Dagsboro, Delaware, is a coal-fired electric generating station operated by NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG).  The Unit 4 Boiler at Indian River has a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) control to reduce NOx emissions.  The SCR process injects a reducing agent into the flue gas duct to convert NOx to nitrogen over the presence of a catalyst.  An aqueous solution of 29.4 percent ammonia is used as the reducing agent.  Aqueous ammonia is delivered to the facility in trucks and is stored in a common storage and handling system.  The storage system includes two horizontal aboveground, atmospheric 45,000-gallon storage tanks, pumps, and piping.  The tanks are equipped with overfill protection and vapor pressure relief devices and are located within secondary containment. The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored at this facility is 90,000 gallons or 674,041 pounds.\r\n\r\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia used for NOx control at Indian River is considered hazardous by the USEPA.  The properties that make ammonia valuable as a reactant in SCR systems also necessitate certain safety precautions.  NRG strives to protect all of its valuable assets - both personnel and property.  To prevent exposure to personnel as well as nearby members of our community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment, Indian River complies with all federal, state and local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, NRG works to minimize potential releases.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of aqueous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  NRG works in conjunction with the Dagsboro F"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nUnder 40 CFR Part 68, Indian River's aqueous ammonia storage and handling system is subject to the Program 2 Prevention Program.  The facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  These requirements include:\r\n - Documentation of safety information;\r\n - Periodic hazard reviews;\r\n - Documentation of operating procedures;\r\n - Training of employees;\r\n - Preventative maintenance, inspection and testing of equipment;\r\n - Completion of compliance audits; and,\r\n - Incident investigation.\r\n\r\nPlant personnel are trained about the prevention program elements.  Operation technicians receive classroom and on-the-job training to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Additionally, the ammonia system is operated, tested, and maintained to stringent industry standards. \r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe facility has not experienced any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia in the past five years.  \r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nAn aqueous ammonia emergency response plan has been developed, and employees have been trained on this plan.  The facility has on-site hazardous materials-trained personnel to respond in a defensive fashion.  Employees receive annual refresher training.  \r\n\r\nPlant personnel work with the Sussex County Emergency Planning Commission and the Dagsboro Fire Department on emergency preparedness.  This includes meeting with representatives of each to address any changes in the facility or any new concern.  \r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility trains and tests all operation technicians who work on the aqueous ammonia system.  The plant preventative maintenance program is above standard.  The RMP Plan requires that a Hazard Review be completed for the aqueous ammonia stora"
