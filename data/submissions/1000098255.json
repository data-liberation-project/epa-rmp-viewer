In 1998, prior to the building of the chlorine dioxide generator, Halsey Pulp Mill began implementing OSHA process safety management. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established a requirement for facilities with listed material greater than the threshold quantity to plan for possible off-site consequences of a release.  There are three planning program levels.  Both Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide fall under the Program 3 requirements.  Chlorine has been removed from use at the facility in 2021.\r\n\r\nProgram 3 - essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\r\n\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements.\r\n\r\nProgram 3 Prevention Program\r\nThe Program 3 prevention program for chlorine dioxide consists of the following 12 elements:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information. The facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the processes. These documents address (1) physical properties of chlorine dioxide, (2) operating parameters of the equipment, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment. These documents are also used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment. The process safety information is available to all employees, the local emergency personnel, and the fire department.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis.  The facility performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHA's) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.

The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features.\r\n\r\nChlorine Dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is generated on site. The chlorine dioxide generator was designed as a fail-safe design. In emergency situations, the chemicals supplied to the generator are stopped. The reaction is quenched with chilled water. In a power failure situation, the chilled water valves to the tank fail open so that the reaction will immediately be quenched. Chlorine dioxide is stored at a stable temperature of 45 \u00b0F in refrigerated tanks that are continually swept with air to remove any residual chlorine dioxide. The residual chlorine dioxide is sent back into the generator system.\r\n \r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nCascade Pacific Pulp has completed a five-year accident history for chlorine and chlorine dioxide.

      "SummaryText": "The Halsey Pulp Mill is updating the RMP to reflect changes in chemicals regulated by the 40 CFR Part 68.  The Halsey Pulp Mill has one chemical, chlorine dioxide, which are regulated by the Risk Management Plan.  As a regulated facility, the mill is required to submit an updated RMP at least every 5 years.  The RMP has been updated in 2009, 2014 and 2019.  The RMP is being updated 2022 for the removal of chlorine from the mill site.\r\n\r\nFor the 5-year update, data was updated using the RMP*eSubmit on the EPA website.  The following information is reviewed and updated as necessary in RMP*eSubmit: the facility and registration information, Worst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios, accident history, prevention program 3 information, and emergency response information.\r\n\r\nRegistration Information\r\n\r\nThe registration information was updated to reflect personnel changes.  The latitude and longitude of the facility were reviewed and were correct as well as the NAICS Codes.\r\n\r\nWorst Case and Alternate Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe facility has one chemical which is regulated under the risk management program.  The chemical is chlorine dioxide.  Chlorine dioxide is manufactured on site for use in the pulp mill as the primary bleaching agent.  Chlorine dioxide is stored in three 63,000-gallon tanks which is greater than the threshold of 1000 lbs.  The worst-case scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupturing of one of the tanks.  There is a containment area to hold the contents of the release.  This scenario has not changed.  The alternative scenario is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide pipe in the pipe bridge above the road.  This scenario remains the same.  \r\n\r\nBecause the Risk Management Plan Modeling was updated in 2019, the most recent census from 2010 was used.  \r\n\r\nAccident History\r\n\r\nThe accident history from June 2014 to December 2021 was reviewed.  There were no accidents from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or"

The Halsey Pulp Mill is in Halsey, Oregon. The company is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for workers, the public, and the environment. As part of this commitment, the company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Halsey Pulp Mill. One component of this system is the risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Halsey Pulp Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the mill. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Halsey Pulp Mill.  The risk management program consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule.\r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\r\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from c"
