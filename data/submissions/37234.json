This Plant is one of six water and\n\nWastewater Plants operated by the City. Wastewater Plant#2 and \n\nfour other plants have quanties of regulated hazardous \n\nchemicals above the EPA threshold. The City has a unified Risk\n\nManagement Program which applies to each plant. Only\n\nWastewater Treatment Plant #2 operations and policies are \n\npresented in this Plan.\n\n\n\nWastewater Treatment #2 uses two regulated substances chlorine \n\n(CAS Number 7782-50-5)in the chlorination process.\n\nThe chlorination process consists of the use of chlorine from \n\none-ton cylinders to disinfect treated wastewater.\n\nThe other regulated substance is Sulfur dioxide (Cas Number 7446-09-5)\n\n used in the dechlorination process.\n\nThe sulfur dioxide process consist of the use of sulfur dioxide \n\nfrom one-ton clyinders for dechlorination of the treated wastewater.\n\n\n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program\n\n(RMP), the facility has developed an accidental\n\nrelease prevention program and emergency action plan for the facility.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program\n\nsatisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational \n\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA)\n\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) program.  The prevention program \n\nensures that the facility is operated under safe\n\nconditions and that any risk of an accidental release due to human \n\nerror, the facility's prevention program ensures that\n\noperating procedures are current and reviewed annually.Training also \n\nplays a vital part in the facility's program.\n\nEmployees and contractors working near or on the chlorination process\n\nor sulfur dioxide process are required \n\nto be trained in the chlorination process an"

All chlorine \n\nand sulfur dioxide cylinders are examined upon \n\ndelivery and are rejected if there are any signs of damage. In addition,\n\nequipment pertaining to the chlorine process and\n\nthe sulfur dioxide process is visually inspected daily.
