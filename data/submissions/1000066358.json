The key components of this program include:\n\n\n\n- Development of emergency response plan containing the following elements:\n\n- Procedures for informing public and local emergency response agencies\n\n- Proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment\n\n- Procedures for response after an accidental release\n\n- Procedures for emergency response equipment use, inspection, testing, and maintenance\n\n- Training for all employees\n\n- Procedures for emergency response plan review and updates\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA process hazard analysis was completed for the facility in accordance with the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  The process hazard analysis yielded the following action items:\n\n\n\n- Post the Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) in cabinets and Valve Manifold Boxes (VMBs) \n\n- Evaluate need for continuous monitoring, detection/alarm system, or containment for outdoor HCl distribution lines\n\n\n\nAs required by RMP regulations, the process hazard analysis will be reviewed every five years to update HCl safety measures and implement improvements as needed to ensure the ongoing safe operation of the HCl systems at the facility.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe RMP program requires affected facilities to determine offsite impacts resulting from a prescribed worst-case scenario (WCS).
