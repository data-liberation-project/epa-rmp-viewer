Applicable written elements of the PSM and the Risk Management Program are readily accessible by employees.  Audible alarms located throughout the facility provide reliable notification of syngas (hydrogen) releases.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nIn the past five years, one accident occurred. The incident took place on September 14, 2013, at 9:40 pm. During the transition of slurry, piping upstream of the M-120A Mixer failed. The failure occurred approximately five (5) seconds after the water flush began, allowing for the release of gasifier contents to the atmosphere. Operations determined the problem approximately twenty eight (28) seconds after the initial release and pressed the Emergency Shutdown Button. There were no injuries resulting from the incident. Some damage occurred to the slurry piping and to the west side of the slurry heater building.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe SGS plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency res"

The facility has fully integrated employees in emergency response team.   Appropriate personnel protective equipment including respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus are available onsite for response to emergency situations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe SGS facility is located at 444 W. Sandford Avenue in West Terre Haute, Indiana.  The facility completed construction in 1995 and is located on approximately 14 acres.  Wabash Valley Power Association and Standard General are the owners of SGS.  CB&I provides technical and managerial services on behalf of the owner.  Plant operations and support staff are employed by SGS.  \r\n\r\nSGS operates an Air Separation Unit (ASU) that provides nitrogen and oxygen for the gasification process.  SGS also operates a gasification facility using CB&I E-Gas Technology in which coal/petcoke is converted to a synthetic fuel gas (syngas).  The syngas is then used to power a combustion turbine at the Wabash River Combined Cycle Plant located adjacent to SGS.  The syngas is a mixture of gases, including hydrogen.  The maximum amount of syngas on site when the plant is in operation, in the vessels and interconnecting piping, is approximately 34,500 lbs.  The only chemical that exceeds the RMP threshold quantities is hydrogen, which is found in concentrations within the syngas product at greater than 1% when the plant is in operation.  No other regulated substances (toxic or flammables) at the facility are stored or used at quantities which would require compliance with the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\nHazards Assessments\r\n\r\nHydrogen is the only regulated chemical under the RMP program at the facility. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used EPA's RMP*Comp program. Additional specific information on these releases is presented in det"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities. Plant and process modifications are also administered through the MOC and PSSR processes as applicable, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in these changes.  Facility-wide training regarding emergency procedures and evacuation routes occurs on an annual basis.  Annual mock drills are conducted at the facility and frequent communications with local emergency response teams ensure that they are aware of the facility's overall process and hazards.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nSGS is committed to continuous improvement and safe operation of its petcoke and or coal gasification system and is in the process of addressing corrective actions deemed necessary.  The facility mechanical integrity preventative maintenance procedures have recently been reviewed/revised and a new tracking system implemented.  The facility is dedicated to resolving all corrective actions from PHAs, and internal and/or external reviews in a timely manner.  SGS maintains documentation of the ongoing progress as related to such items."
