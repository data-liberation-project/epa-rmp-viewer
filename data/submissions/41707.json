The County of St. Charles, Missouri and its employees are committed to achieving this goal through the implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The benefits of this program are intended to provide a safer workplace for employees and a safer environment for the community.\n\nDue to the fact that this facility is owned and operated by a local government, is not subject Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety standards, and because it exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency?s threshold of 2,500 pounds, a Program 2 level RMP has been developed to meet regulatory requirements.  Procedures for implementing and maintaining the RMP Program are contained within this document.\n\nThe Water Department Plant Manager along with the assistance of the County Engineer and Assistant County Engineer have the primary responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP program.  The Water Superintendent will have primary responsibility in the absence of the Plant Manager.\n\nThis facility supplies potable water to one primary customer; the St. Charles County Public Water Supply District #2.  The facility consists of a well field of nine wells, a single-stage water softening treatment plant and approximately 8.0 million gallons of finished water storage.  The plant has a water supply capacity of approximately 22.4 million gallons per day.\n\nThe subject of the ?St. Charles County Water Plant Risk Management Plan? involves the use and storage of hazardous chemicals involved in the water treatment and disinfection process.  Currently, chlorine is the only chemical being stored and used in excess of the threshold quantity for chlorine in "

The maximum intended inventory at any given time that the plant could store is approximately 16,000 pounds.  Chlorine is irritating and corrosive to the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and reacts violently with easily oxidized materials.  Contact with evaporating chlorine or equipment releasing flashing chlorine can cause severe frostbite burns.  Chlorine gas is heavier than air and will tend to travel along the ground topography filling spaces, pits, and displacing breathable air.  Chlorine is also highly toxic to aquatic life. The chlorine storage area for this facility is located in a separate storage building adjacent to areas of normal operations of personnel.\n \nChlorine gas is injected into water at the pre-filtration, hydrotreater, and post-filtration stages in the process to chemically disinfect along with other water treatment chemicals prior to distribution into the public water supply system.  The chlorine is delivered to the process from 2,000-pound steel cylinders via a regulated vacuum system which allows operators of the system to control the flow and rate of chlorine into the water treatment system.\n\nIn accordance with CFR Part 68, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) has been performed to determine and document the facilities RMP program eligibility and to meet the EPA hazard assessment requirements for the applicable program.  This offsite consequence analysis defines the toxic end point in all directions for worst-case and alternative release scenarios based on the applicable EPA guidance documents, modeling software, current available U.S. Census Bureau data, and available mapping tools.  The County?s own mapping and census figures were also used to determine the population that would be affected in worst-case and alternative release scenarios.

The container drops to the ground outside of the storage building and a catastrophic failure occurs upon impact, releasing the entire contents of the container onto the ground.  As the emergency response program is initiated, a chlorine gas cloud begins to form and drift off-site with the prevailing wind direction.?\n\nThe EPA?s RMP* Comp (Version 1.07) was utilized to model the worst case scenario using the program?s data elements to determine the distance to toxic end point.  No passive mitigation factors were considered for the worst-case scenario analysis.  Administrative controls, operating procedures, and design for the process limit the number of cylinders that can be connected to the process at any given time.  Thus, the worst-case scenario considers the maximum contents of one full container.\n\nPopulation estimates within the distance to the toxic end point (3.0 miles) were obtained by using the RTK NET Landview 5 program (Version 1.0) and were confirmed by using the County?s own census data and population density information. \n\nAn alternative release scenario was also developed to model a more realistic release than the worst-case scenario such as releases from joints, flanges, elbows, weld points, valves, and other vessel appurtenances.\n\nThe following information summarizes and documents an ?alternative release scenario? for the facility:\n \nScenario: ?A tubing or valve and yoke assembly connection fails releasing liquid chlorine into the chlorine storage room floor from a horizontal 2,000 pound cylindrical tank.

The EPA?s ?Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance? document was utilized to determine the alternative release scenario using the following standard assumptions:\n\nThe ambient relative humidity is 50%.\n\nThe ambient temperature of the surrounding air and the temperature of the chemical before the release is 77 degrees F (25 degrees C).\n\nThe facility is located in a rural or urban area.\n\nThe wind speed is 3.0 meters per second at 10.0 meters above the ground.\n\nThe atmospheric stability is Class D (moderate wind speed and overcast skies).\n\nThe release occurs at different elevations relative to the ground.\n\nThe model determines the extent of the liquid evaporation at the source for liquefied gases.\n\nPassive building mitigation factor of 55%.\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint (1.0 miles) for the alternative case release scenario was estimated using The EPA?s Supplemental Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (July, 2004) utilizing the program?s data elements, applicable look-up tables, equations, and formulas.\n\nAt atmospheric pressure and ambient temperatures, chlorine displays a greenish-yellow color.  In a gaseous state, it is approximately 2.5 times heavier than air and will tend to sink and conform to the contour of the ground in low lying areas.  As the gas spreads, it will become diluted with air depending on weather conditions, wind speed, humidity, etc.  As the gas becomes more diluted it will become neutrally buoyant and begin to travel with the main air streams.\n\nThis effect is particularly important to the St. Charles County Water Plant because it is situated in a low lying area relative to the terrain immediately surrounding the area.  It should be noted that the modeling programs and equations used to perform the worst-case and alternative release scenarios do not account "

Even if there is a prevailing cross-wind, the chlorine gas may tend to follow a depression due to its density.\n\nThe heavier-than-air gas behavior can also be used as an advantage if ravines and downhill slopes lead to natural reservoirs such as a small creek or a lake.  It is important to recognize that these behaviors may be a much more accurate tool for predicting the events and consequences of a release than the modeling programs.\n \nChlorine for the facility is transported and stored in a liquid state under pressure.  When a leak occurs in a container or piping system, the quick reduction in pressure that occurs would cause the liquid chlorine to vaporize as it is released into the atmosphere.  The remainder of the liquid would pool and vaporize as it is warmed by environmental conditions.  When chlorine changes state from a liquid or a vapor, it expands to approximately 450 times the liquid volume.  Therefore, a release of chlorine liquid poses a significantly greater risk than a chlorine gas leak from a similarly sized vessel, pipe, or leak point.\n\nIt is the intention of the St. Charles County Water Plant to minimize or eliminate the risk of an accidental release of a hazardous substance by utilizing the RMP program as a managerial tool to maintain and improve its internal operations, maintenance, and training programs which already currently exist.\n\nThe St. Charles County Water Plant has developed an Emergency Response Program as part of the RMP Program.  The purpose of this to ensure that the St. Charles County Water Plant maintains current and complete written emergency action plans (EAP?s) and effective response capabilities for all RMP covered processes.

Other outside agencies and response teams will be called as deemed necessary for assistance.  The St. Charles County Hazardous Materials Response Plan has therefore been incorporated into the St. Charles County Water Plant RMP by reference and recognized as part of the emergency action plan (EAP) for this facility.\n\nIn addition, the St. Charles County Standard Operating Procedure for E.O.C. Assistance (January, 2004) is also incorporated by reference into the RMP Plan for weather and other natural disasters which could potentially cause a release of a regulated substance.\n\nThe Plant Manager and the County Engineer will ensure that the emergency response team is adequately staffed and that the required equipment is supplied and maintained.  The Plant Manager will coordinate with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC), local fire department, and hazardous materials teams.  It is the intention of the St. Charles County Water Plant to conduct regular emergency response drills with local emergency responders in an effort to coordinate effective and safe responses in the event of an actual release.\n \nEmergency evacuation procedures, guidelines, and assembly areas have been established.  For minor releases, the initial assembly area will be the Control Room.  For a major release and evacuation, the initial assembly point shall be at the front gate entrance to the facility.
