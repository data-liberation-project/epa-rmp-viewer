      "SummaryText": "The flour mill has chlorine gas on site in the form of one ton containers.  We work together with our chlorine supplier(Caravan Corbion) and the local fire department to establish effective procedures for an immediate response and action in the event of an accidental release of chlorine gas.  We have written procedures for the handling of chlorine and conduct annual employee training on the hazards associated with chlorine and the safe handling of chlorine.  Our chlorine monitoring system monitors any potential leakage in the chlorine storage areas and agitators.  We are committed to the safety of our employees and our community.  The flour mill provides top quality flour to a number of food companies in the Midwest.  We use chlorine gas to bleach certain brands of flour and adjust their pH.  We typically store 14 one ton chlorine containers on site of which we have 7 connected and available for use at any one time.  The containers are stored in an isolated block room.  Preventative measures include; training our employees in the safe handling of chlorine, coordinated training with our local fire department, chlorine monitoring equipment in the chlorine room and on the third floor near the agitators, emergency shutoff valves, low temperature switch interlock, blower/agitator interlock, monitoring and maintenance in coordination with our supplier, Corbion Caravan.  Our piping is designed for use with chlorine gas and is inspected regularly.  We continually strive to improve the safety of our employees and community with safe handling and useage of chlorine at our mill.    "
