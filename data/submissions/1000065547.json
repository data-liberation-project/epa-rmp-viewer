The warehouse and storage facility located at 30933 Imperial St. Shafter, California, and handles various chemicals for resale.  Chemicals are purchased from manufacturers or their representatives, brought to the Argo Chemical facility, unloaded, stored, blended and reloaded for shipment to the customer. The following are key elements of the Risk Management Plan:\n\n\n\n(a) Argo chemical is a retail operation subject to the OSHA Process Management Standard.  Argo Chemical incorporates all the elements of the Program 3 Prevention program, worst-case scenario analysis, alternative release analysis, 5-year history, document management system, process safety information, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audit, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permits and emergency response plan.\n\n\n\n(b) The stationary sources for the regulated substances handled are:\n\n\n\nAqua ammonia (>20%):\n\n  This product, handled in bulk, is stored in five tanks. Each of the four tanks have a fill capacity of 25,740 gallons (192,351 pounds) storing 29.5% aqua ammonia. It is loaded into tanker trucks using pumps and hoses with a vapor return line from the tanker trailer to the storage tank.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia:\n\n  Argo chemical stores this product in six (6) pressurized tanks. 1-tank with a 15,446 gal capacity, with a maximum fill capacity of 13,130 gallons (74,607 lbs.), 4-13,000 gal tanks with fill capacities of 11,050 gallons (62776 lbs.), and 1-tank with a 21,619 gal capacity with a fill capacity of 18,360 gallons (104,304 lbs.). Bulk shipments of anhydrous ammonia are received by pressurized transport and unloaded directly into the ammonia storage tanks. Anhydrous ammonia is used on site to produce aqua ammonia, and for delivery in smaller quantities. Also, compressed anhydrous ammonia cyl"

The facility stores no more than 90 - 150 lb. ammonia cylinders at any one time.\n\n\n\nChlorine gas:\n\n   This product is delivered from the manufacture in capped 150 lb pressurized cylinders. A total of 30 cylinders may be off-loaded from the delivery truck in cages and strapped into place before being removed from the truck. The cylinders are transported in cages and strapped and chained together. Argo then delivers the cylinders to the end user using the same procedure.  At no time is the chlorine gas used in any of the processes at Argo Chemical. The maximum number of cylinders stored at the facility is 40 - 150 lb. cylinders. \n\n\n\n(c) Worst-case scenarios\n\n\n\nAqua ammonia: the release of the entire contents of the largest tank (192,351 lbs.) in 10 minutes due to a liquid spill; or alternatively 3,700 lbs. are released in 10 minutes due to a transfer hose failure. \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia: the release of the entire contents of the tank (104,300 lbs.) in 10 minutes due to a liquid spill; or alternatively the release of 2,700 lbs. in 15 minutes due to a transfer hose failure. \n\n\n\nChlorine:  A release of 150 lbs. from a single cylinder in 10 minutes due to a total valve failure or alternatively the leakage of 150 lbs. in 100 minutes due to valve leakage.\n\n\n\n(d) Argo Chemical has in place an accidental release prevention program, which, among others, includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Instructions, Compliance Audits and Training. Furthermore, the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia handling facility has a deluge system capable of delivering 100 gallons per minute of water in a form of a spray covering the ammonia plant and storage area in its entirety.\n\n\n\n(e) Argo Chemical has an Emergency Response Plan and coordinates its activities with all applicable Governmental Agencies.\n\n\n\n(f) Argo Chemical is committed to safe and responsible distribution of chemical p"
