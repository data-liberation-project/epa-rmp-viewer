This document has been prepared to consider the propane terminal as a single RMP Program Level 3 process.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nEl Dorado Logistics LLC has a dedicated commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance activities . The goal is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, terminal personnel have been trained on the proper response to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nHollyFrontier Corporation established the propane terminal under a master limited partnership, El Dorado Logistics LLC, a subsidiary of  Holly Energy Partners (HEP), which owns and operates the terminal. The propane terminal is located at in 1651 S. Haverhill Rd, El Dorado, Kansas and receives propane via pipeline from the HollyFrontier El Dorado Refining LLC's (HFEDR's) refinery, located adjacent to the terminal. Propane is the only RMP regulated substance above its threshold quantity in the terminal.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE/CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe propane terminal is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Therefore, there is a management system in place to address each element and to implement the accident prevention program. A brief discussion follows for each of these areas. Employee participation is encouraged in the development, review and application of procedures and information regarding the various PSM and RMP elements. Some of the more significant opportunities for active participation are Process Hazard A"

The information regarding chemicals and equipment is extensive and is continuously being verified and updated.\n\n\n\nIdentifying potential hazards is a critical element of the safety process at the  terminal. Process Hazard Analysis study has been performed on the propane terminal and is revalidated on a 5 year schedule. Hazard analysis is also performed on changes through the Management of Change process. Recommendations resulting from the studies are addressed and actions taken to address the recommendations are documented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures have been developed to provide instructions for safely operating the  terminal. These procedures serve as a consistent basis for training new operators and for reference by experienced operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed, are considered in the management of change process and are annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nOperator Training is conducted in coordination with the operating procedures. New employees receive foundational and task specific training on terminal operation. All operators receive refresher training to ensure operating skills and knowledge are maintained and enhanced. Training requirements are also considered when changes are made to the process.\n\n\n\nThe terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce and because this work is often on or near process equipment, there are specific requirements for contractors. Contractor safety programs, performance and training are evaluated prior to allowing them to perform work in the terminal. The contractors are made aware of terminal safety rules and evacuation plans and are informed of potential hazards related to their work. Contractor activities are moni"

The review and authorization process makes provisions for reviewing the change from several aspects, including the potential hazards, safety and health effects, procedural updates and training requirements. The pre-startup safety review provides a final safety review of the change prior to startup.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity programs are necessary to provide for the on-going integrity of process equipment and instrumentation. Experienced employees and qualified contractors perform maintenance work on the equipment and instrumentation. Inspection and tests are performed in accordance with facility and industry standards and quality assurance is incorporated in new construction and maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations are valuable learning tools in determining facts regarding incidents and in developing corrective actions to prevent recurrence. The terminal has personnel resources trained in incident investigation techniques and they are assigned as required to form teams, investigate incidents and report on the findings. The report and any recommendations are then acted on to improve the safety of the terminal and the refinery.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices at the HFEDR refinery are long-standing practices to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. These are periodically reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, audits are periodically conducted to confirm the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. The findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most"

HEP employees are not emergency responders and are not trained as emergency responders. They will support emergency response activities by providing emergency responders with site and product specific information.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a fire HEP employees are to call 911 and / or 222 [(316) 321-8222]  to notify emergency responders of the emergency, where the fire is and provide as much detail as possible about the nature of the fire including exposures and probable contents that are burning.\n\n\n\nIn the event of a leak or release HEP employees are to call 911 and / or 222 (316) 321-8222 to notify emergency responders of the emergency, where they should respond and share the details of the suspected product that is leaking or being released. If it is known they will share details such as the size of the container, the size of the leak and rate of discharge. HEP employees are trained to identify a leak and to report their findings by notifying emergency responders.\n\n\n\nFor a needed rescue HEP employees are to call 911 and / or 222 (316) 321-8222 to notify emergency responders of the emergency, where they should respond and share the details of the nature of the needed rescue.

The HEP employee should share as much detail as possible describing the onset of the incident and potential hazards that are either already addressed or that need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nThe role of all HEP employees during any emergency is to provide details and identify concerns and warn responders of actual and potential hazards and issues they need to know to safely manage the incident.\n\n\n\nThere is no emergency response equipment at the facility other than equipment to address incidental incipient level fires\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEl Dorado Logistics LLC will continue to seek improvement in safety for the terminal and surrounding community. Areas of focus include:\n\n\n\n- Performing audits and HAZOP revalidations, and addressing findings from these activities\n\n- Upgrading incident investigation, action item tracking and management of change software. \n\n\n\n"
