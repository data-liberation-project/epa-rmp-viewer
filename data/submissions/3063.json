The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorine Dioxide System operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the Manager of Pulp and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorine Dioxide System is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the Manager of Pulp for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nInternational Paper-Pine Bluff Mill engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Chlorine Dioxide System operation should be safely performed.  These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n* unit startup,\n* normal operations,\n* temporary operations,\n* emergency shutdown,\n* normal shutdown, and\n* initial startup of a new process.\n\nThe written operating procedures include:"

A primary aspect of this commitment is the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes.  Our commitment is also demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes, as well as, extensive training of our operating personnel. \nIn the event of an accidental release, the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill has procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment.  The International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill's emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases.  An emergency response coordinator has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have been ongoing throughout the preparation of this plan and policies.\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill established a management system headed by the Manager of Environmental, Health and Safety to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n\n2.0  INTERNATIONAL PAPER-PINE BLUFF MILL AND REGULATED \tSUBSTANCES\nThe International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill, located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, is primarily involved in the manufacture of high quality coated bleached paper board.

The chlorine dioxide used at the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill, is generated on site, immediately absorbed into water, and then stored in a 0.9% solution.  The RMP Rule exempts regulated toxic substances which are stored and used in solutions or mixtures of less than 1.0% by weight.  However, the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill has elected to pursue development of a RMP Plan for chlorine dioxide consistent with the requirements of the General Duty Clause of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\nThe regulated use of chlorine dioxide at the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill is as follows:\n\nProcess Description: Chlorine Dioxide System           \nProgram Level: 3\nRegulatedSubstance: Chlorine dioxide       \nMaximum Process Quantity: 45,160 lbs.\n\n\n3.0  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nThe International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of an accidental release of chlorine dioxide from our process.  Chlorine dioxide was evaluated for possible worse-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  It is important to understand that the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse-case release is extremely small.  The alternative release scenarios represent a more realistic potential for occurrence and are based on historical data from our process or other similar processes.  By identifying these potential releases, the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the Prevention Program section of this plan.\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected because of an accidental release.  This point is called the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects wou"

The spill is partially contained in secondary containment with the majority of the spill overflowing to form a pool 1 centimeter deep.  The chlorine dioxide evaporates from the solution forming a toxic cloud which reaches offsite endpoints and public receptors.  Although the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill has numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for administrative controls or active mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this scenario.\nAn alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine dioxide is a rupture of a six inch line that carries 0.9% chlorine dioxide solution to the storage tanks.  The chlorine dioxide is released at a rate of 500 gallons per minute for 60 minutes.  A pool is formed on the ground and the chlorine dioxide evaporates to form a toxic cloud.  The toxic endpoint for the toxic cloud reaches just beyond the International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill property boundaries.  No public or environmental receptors are impacted.\nA second alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine dioxide is a release of 0.9% chlorine dioxide solution from a storage tank that fills up the secondary containment volume to 80%.  The total volume of released solution is 6,499 gallons and the secondary containment limits the surface area of the spill to 724 ft2.  The chlorine dioxide evaporates from the released material forming a toxic cloud.  As with the first ARS, the toxic endpoint would not reach public or environmental receptors.\n\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM PROGRAM 3\nThe International Paper-Pine Bluff Mill Chlorine Dioxide System and other processes at the facility are covered by the OSHA P"
