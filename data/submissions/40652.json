The facility Policy: The owners, management and employees of Baring Farm Service Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material. Should and accidental release occur, the facility has orientated and is prepared to work with the local fire department and other local authorities, so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The Primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop nutirent. The maximum quantity stored would be 145,750 pounds in the facility's storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3. Accidental release program: The facility complies with the rule and regulations relating to the handling of anhydrous ammonia equipment, containers and storage facilities. These regulations administered by the Missouri Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. \n\n4. The Five-year Accident History: There have been no releases of anhydrous ammonia at the location in the past 5 years due to the fact that product has not been stored at the site in the last 5 years.. \n\n5. The Emergency Response Program: The facility is in the process of putting a written emergency action plan together in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38. Our emergency response action plan will be provided to the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee for coordination in the community response planning. Employees also receive pre-emergency planning and training.                  \n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performe"
