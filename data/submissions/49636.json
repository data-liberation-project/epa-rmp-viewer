Safety equipment is provided for all employees and they are encouraged daily to use it.  Valves, hoses, and all other handling equipment are to be inspected daily.  Management is to be contacted immediately if there is a problem with any equipment.  Safety meetings are held to review safety procedures and employees are expected to follow them.  No one is permitted to use transfering equipment unless they are properly trained and wear proper safety equipment.\n\nIf there is an accidental release of a reportable quantity, employees are to contact management immediately so that proper authorities and response personel can be contacted.  If there is a major release, Craig Supply employees will not respond, because we do not have the proper personal protective equipment to handle a major release.  Holt County LEPC have training sessions so that personel responding to such an incident are properly trained on how to handle such a situation.\n\nCraig Supply Co is a retail business for agricultural products.  We sell chemicals, seed, liquid and dry fertilizer, and anhydrous ammonia for a nitrogen source for corn production.  We also provide custom application of fertilizer and chemicals.\n\nWe purchased the anhydrous plant and equipment in September of 1995.  Since that time we have not had an accidental release of a reportable quantity or a reportable accident to date.  In 2002 we moved the plant out of the city limits for added safety.\n\nPreventive maintenance is a continual process.  Hoses and valves are checked daily for wear and replaced as needed.  All hoses have the date stamped on them when they are to be taken out of service.  Lines are also checked for leaks or possible failures.\n\nIn the future we will continue to focus on training and use of safety measures.  We continue to have safety training meetings and we have hazardous material handling and transportat"
