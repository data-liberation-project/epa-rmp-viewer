Anhydrous ammonia is a \ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream, \nmilk, juice, and related products.  It is a closed system that contains \napproximately 14,600 pounds (i.e., 2,400 gallons) of ammonia in various \nphysical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the \nhigh-pressure receiver that operates at approximately 170 pounds per \nsquare inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 9,500 pounds of \nliquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 1,300 pounds.  Most \nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The receiver, condensing \ntowers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \npiping, and equipment.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Best Ever Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage \nsystem.  The high-pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (150 to \n180 psig) liquid ammonia to all of the cooling units, which includes:  \ncooler evaporators, freezer evaporators, large and sma"

The freezer units \nreturn ammonia to accumulator #2.  All other units return ammonia to \naccumulators #1 and #3.  Ammonia vapor from accumulator #2 feeds two \nbooster compressors which compress the vapor to 30 psig and discharge \ninto accumulator #1.  Vapor from accumulators #1 and #3 is supplied to \nthe high-stage compressors.  Liquid ammonia is removed from the \naccumulators by high-pressure system gas and is returned to the high-\npressure liquid supply to the cooling units.\n\nThere are five high-stage compressors (i.e., four reciprocating compressors \nand one screw compressor).  The major discharge from the high-stage \ncompressors (hot gas), at 150 to 180 psig, is vented to four evaporative \ncondensers.  The condensed liquid is returned to the high-pressure \nreceiver.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \nsafety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, ammonia \ndetectors, engine room ventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety \nrelief valves protect the compressor discharge and condensers from the \nhazards associated with overpressure.  Safety interlocks include high \npressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as \nwell as high-level floats and sensors for vessels.  The high-pressure cutouts \nfor the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\nA release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n\n* Most of the lines are elevated t"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if/checklist\" technique.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability"

The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \n\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.

Any deficiency found in an audit is corrected.\n\n3.0    ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility in the last five years (since June 1999) that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on-site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n4.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has implemented a detailed written Emergency Action Plan (EAP).  The EAP is intended to address all emergencies at the facility, in addition to incidents rela"

The plan details what personal protective equipment and spill response equipment is available; identifies specific individuals, their 24-hour telephone numbers, and their responsibilities; identifies procedures for emergency medical care; and refers to other pertinent elements of the management system (i.e., standard operating procedures).\n\n5.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nThe prevention program that is described in Section 2.0 of this Executive \nSummary is a management system that is designed to proactively identify, \nevaluate, and reduce the potential for a ammonia release and/or a release's \nimpact or consequence, due to failures in process, procedures, and \nequipment.  As safety improvements are identified by the management \nsystem they are evaluated and, where appropriate, implemented.  For \nexample, the facility may implement the following changes to further improve the safety of the process:\n\n* Additional training,\n* Periodic repair and replacement of equipment, and\n* Continued implementation and improvement of the PSM program.\n\n"
