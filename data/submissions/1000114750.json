The foam manufacturing process uses isobutane as a blowing agent, which is received by truck and stored at the facility in two (2) 14,193-gallon pressure vessels, then transferred from the storage vessels to the blowing area via piping. Isobutane is a regulated flammable substance under the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Chemical Accident Prevention rule (40 CFR 68) and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119); therefore, the foam manufacturing process is subject to EPA RMP and OSHA PSM requirements. The maximum amount of isobutane stored at this facility is 110,000 pounds.\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA RMP rule. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program implemented at the Pregis Hopkinsville facility. \n\nAccidental release prevention and Emergency response policies\nThe same properties\nthat make this material valuable as a blowing agent in our manufacturing process also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions when handling. These precautions are in place to\nprevent the unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to the health of our employees, and\nto reduce the threat to members of the nearby community. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable\nfederal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle\nisobutane. This combined with the safety devices inherent in the design, the safe handling\nprocedures that we use, and the training of our employees helps ensure the safety of our employees and of the surrounding community.

FP International's emergency response program  includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps\nOur facility\u0092s systems and practices are designed to comply with the EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and with all applicable State Codes and Regulations. This facility was designed in accordance with NFPA-58 and NFPA-30. As part of our Corporate Injury Illness and Prevention Plan, all employees receive training covering the following aspects of health and safety; safety philosophy, general safety rules, reporting safety hazards, emergency procedures and hazardous communications. In addition to the training received upon employment, further training is given if any employee is exposed to a hazard previously unrecognized, or if any employee is reassigned to a job which exposes them to new hazards. Our Corporate Hazard Communication Plan, which is located in our safety manual, contains safe work practices, descriptions of the use and care of personal protective equipment, and emergency procedures in case of spills or releases. Emergency and first-aid procedures are also covered.\n\nFurthermore, the process includes safety features such as a fire suppression system, gas sensors, emergency shutdowns, and excess flow valves.\n\nFive-year accident history\nThere have been no significant accidental releases meeting the RMP accident reporting criteria at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program\nThis facility's emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Handbook.
