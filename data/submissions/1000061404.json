Ascend - Decatur Plant is one of the chemical manufacturing facilities that make up the company.  Staffing at Decatur Plant is currently approximately 277 Ascend employees and approximately 86 permanent resident contractor employees.\n\n\n\nBuilt in 1952, the Decatur Plant is situated on a 651.82 acre tract (peninsula), 4 miles west of the City of Decatur, on the Tennessee River (river mile 302). The peninsula is shared by guest operations.  Linde occupies 4 acres, Calpine 20 acres, Toray 50 acres, Styrolution 21 acres.  Over 300 acres are presently in use by Ascend.  The remainder acreage is the old Acrilan footprint which is currently unutilized.\n\n\n\nThe plant was designed to primarily manufacture Acrilan acrylic fiber and various nylon intermediate chemicals for the production of nylon fiber. In April of 2005, the production of Acrilan permanently ceased at this site. The bulk chemicals in the production units and tanks were subsequently removed, with completion occurring by the end of the Third Quarter of 2005. There are two toxic chemicals in our remaining processes that are regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. The RMP regulated chemicals are:\n\n\n\n    Acrylonitrile (AN) -- A raw material to make nylon intermediate chemicals.\n\n    Propionitrile (PN) -- A by-product from manufacture of nylon intermediate chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe main raw material for production of nylon chemicals (i.e., AN) arrives at the plant by barge on the Tennessee River. The principal products are non-RMP chemicals, and are shi"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n \n\n * Process safety information\n\n * Process hazard analysis\n\n * Operating procedures\n\n * Training\n\n * Mechanical integrity Program\n\n * Management of change Process\n\n * Pre-startup review\n\n * Compliance audits\n\n * Incident investigation\n\n * Employee participation\n\n * Hot work permit\n\n * Contractors\n\n \n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n \n\n  Acrylonitrile (AN)\n\n *  Low level alarm on the tank would be triggered.  The area is also visually inspected at least twice daily.  \n\n *  Tank dike would minimize the release of material.  Check valves on the discharge side of the transfer pumps would prevent material from flowing back into the tank.\n\n *  An operator would notify the site coordinator immediately.  Cleanup would be handled by the HAZMAT team.\n\n *  ACAM sensors are located in the units to alarm operations when the detection of AN is present in the areas.\n\n\n\n  Propionitrile (PN)\n\n * ACAM system would alarm due to high PN concentration in the air.  The sump level alarm would trigger.  This alarm can only be turned off at a location next to the tank, so someone would have to notice the release while acknowledging the alarm.  Low level alarm on the PNT Tank would go off.  The area is inspected at least twice daily.\n\n *  Tank dike would contain the material and prevent ground contamination.  Check valves on the discharge side of the transfer pumps would prevent material from flowing back into the tank if the release occurred while loading a railcar.\n\n *  An operator would stop the flow of material into the tank and immediately contact the site coordinator.

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\n\n\n5.0  Five-year Accident History\n\n\n\nOn January 29, 2016 at 01:14 AM the B System separator, which is considered a covered process, experienced a deflagration.  This caused a unit shutdown that required emergency response to extinguish a fire coming from the top of the B System scrubber.  There was a minor release of AN and PN vapors, but it was not considered a reportable release.  A formal root cause analysis investigation immediately followed this event.  The investigation report is available at the Decatur site.\n\n\n\n6.0  Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWe at the Decatur plant use several types of safety audits to ensure that our plant runs safely.   Following are some of the different types of audits, inspections and reviews that are conducted:  PSM and Non-PSM audits, ISO audits, Corporate and Insurance surveys and audits, Environmental and Industrial Hygiene audits, RC 14001 audits, and supervisor audits.  We conduct pre-engineering safety audits and inspections on new process before any engineering work is done.  During the phase of construction walk-through safety inspections are completed.  Pre-startup safety reviews are done before the process is started.\n\n\n\nAscend at Decatur, Alabama is very dedicated in preparation just in case we might have an emergency.  The entire Emergency Response Team receives CPR and First Aid/AED training.  We have approximately 35 firefighters across the 5 shifts that we work.  These firefighters train 48 hours annually at the site on incidents involving flammable liquid fires, interior fire fighting, hazardous communications, incident command and others.  "

One fire truck is equipped with foam and another truck is equipped with dry chemical extinguishing agent to supplement the 8 fire pumps that draw fire water from the river.  \n\n\n\nCurrently, we have 9 EMTs training 24 hours annually on trauma assessment, burn care, confined space rescue and others. The EMT's receive 8 hour CPR and 1st aid training every other year.  On alternating years, the EMT's receive EVOC training.  We have a fully stocked ambulance readily available should we need to transport any of our employees to a local hospital.  Our EMTs are all nationally registered and state licensed.  \n\n\n\nThe entire fire brigade is trained to the HAZMAT technician level and are pro-board certified and will respond to on-site chemical emergencies.  We also have specialists that respond to on-site and to off-site chemical emergencies.  These dedicated people are trained to handle both railcar and highway emergencies.  They train on chemical data, shipping containers, vessels, tanks and incident command.  We have a fully stocked emergency van that carries supplies that the Specialist use to control any chemical emergencies.\n\n\n\nOur site budgets appropriately and provides resources for projects that protect the environment, health and safety of our employees and our surrounding community.  Some examples of projects implemented are maintaining approximately 37 deluge automatic sprinkler systems, 13 smoke detection systems, 7 wet-pipe systems, 8 fire pumps, miles of underground fire mains, hundreds of fire extinguishers, and other protection equipment.\n\n\n\nAscend (formally Solutia) is a charter member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and has a representative on the Executive Steering Committee of this organization.
