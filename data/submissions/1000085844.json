This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  The Highwater Ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of natural gasoline denaturant (a flammable mixture), which contains n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and butane, which are regulated substances above the threshold quantities.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\n\nHighwater Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from any hazardous substances used in its chemical manufacturing process, specifically natural gasoline.  It is the policy of Highwater Ethanol to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws. The Highwater Ethanol facility has a detailed Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases. \n\nHighwater Ethanol has emergency response policies in place that are addressed in the facility's Health and Safety Plan, Industrial Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP), Spill Prevention, Controls, and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC), Facility Response Plan (FRP), and Emergency Action Plan. Most of the listed Plans have annual training requirements (at a minimum) to keep employees educated on emergency response procedures in place at the facility.  All new employees are required to attend orientation where the Plans listed above are reviewed.  New employees also undergo training on emergency response procedures prior to initiating responsibilities onsite.\n\n\n\nHighwater Ethanol's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond"
