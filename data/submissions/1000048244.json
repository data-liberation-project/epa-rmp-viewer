              "Description": "The No 1 Sulfur Recovery Unit process is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 Accident Prevention Program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 Accident Prevention Program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup SafetyReview, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 Accident Prevention Program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-StartupSafety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

There are 12 elements of the PSM program which have been extended to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements where necessary.  These elements are Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractors, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Safe Work Practices, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audits.  In addition to the 12 elements, this unit utilizes process controls such as relief valves, flares, automatic shutoffs, emergency air supply, backup pumps, grounding equipment, mitigating systems such as dikes, and operator routine checks to ensure safe operation.  The expected dates for completion of changes as a result of a PHA, audit, and incident investigation includes time for completing engineering work and/or the next scheduled shutdown/turnaround during which the work can be completed.",

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards. \n\n\n\nCatlettsburg Refining, LLC primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available. Checklists are utilized to evaluate Human Factors and Facility Siting. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise and a trained team leader. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. They ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention. All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the controls put in place originally and those added as a result of the HAZOP do not eventually deviate significantly from the original safety intent, Catlettsburg Refining, LLC periodically updates and revalidates the PHA results.
