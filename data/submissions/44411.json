This scenario results in the release of approximately 127,491 pounds of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 7.8 km or 4.8 miles and may affect approximately 56,464 individuals within the zone of impact radius in accordance to Landview 6.\r\nThe alternate release scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the rupture of the railcar unloading hose with the spill contents being discharged to existing ground surfaces. This scenario results in the release of approximately 420 pounds of ammonia. The distance to the toxic endpoint is 200 m.\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for aqua ammonia assumes release of the entire contents of one 20,000-gallon storage tank.  This scenario results in the release of approximately 10,000 pounds of aqua ammonia.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is approximately 2.6 km or 1.6 miles and may affect approximately 60 individuals within the zone of impact radius in accordance to Landview 6.\r\nThe alternate release scenario for aqua ammonia was rupture of the unloading hose.  This scenario results in the release of approximately 56 pounds of aqua ammonia.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 54 m and will likely not affect any individuals within the impact radius.\r\nThe piping and distribution network for anhydrous and aqua ammonia is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. In addition, the tank areas are equipped with emergency eyewash and safety showers.  The pesticides are stored within a warehouse, which will contain a liquid release of pesticide and control the dispersion.\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\r\n* Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\r\n* Proper oper"

The Dixon Fire Department will be the first responder in an ammonia emergency.  Tremont Group personnel will perform awareness duties only, which simply means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, Tremont Group personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. In the event of a major release, The Tremont Group may join forces with Dixon FD and State/County OES personnel in a unified command effort until the emergency has been mitigated.\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\r\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\r\n* Periodic inspection of ammonia tank, containment area, pumps, and piping network.\r\n* Monitoring of anhydrous ammonia storage tank and system pressures and temperatures.\r\n* Monitoring of unloading/delivery procedures.\r\n* Provide all required safety and response equipment.\r\n* Provide a chemical specific training program.\r\n* Access to The Tremont Group Dixon Facility is controlled, and the facility is fenced.\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\tPresently, The Tremont Group is operating a number of similar facilities in Northern California.
