DFC is expanding to include an additional 31050 Sq. Ft. refrigerated space and employ two half car portable vacuum cooling ammonia precooling processes. This will result in 3 closed-loop processes in proximity to each other. This Risk Management Plan will consider these three closed-loop refrigerating operations as one co-located process.  The addition of one of the portable Vacuum Tube systems and its ammonia is expected November 3, 2021, which in co-located configuration will put the aggregate ammonia amount over the RMP threshold amount. Operations are scheduled to commence after the City of Yuma's final approval in early November. \n\n\n\n1    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe DFC Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply to not have accidental releases or emergencies. The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily (in-season) implementation of its Safety Programs, which includes both the EPA Risk Management and OSHA's Process Safety Management Programs.  DFC has developed their RMP / PSM Manual to document policies addressing the implementation of the regulations governing these programs.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include a Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.  Nuances between the RMP & PSM Programs have been integrated according to Guidance documents published by USEPA.  \n\n\n\nThe PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances and forms the"

      "SummaryText": " Program Level 3 Prevention Program component of the RMP as describe above. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if they do happen.  It is the primary goal of DFC to protect its employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n\n\n\nDFC has adopted an overall \"non-responding facility\" policy; has established an Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Fire Department will be continued on an ongoing basis.  Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate Reports, and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  DFC and affiliated Western Precooling Systems (WPS) support the Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day, which has also been instrumental in coordination with local emergency responders.  As an existing facility permitted by the City of Yuma, the Fire Department has overseen development of its fire & life safety systems, which are also permitted. \n\n\n\nDFC & WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if they do happen. DFC Personnel are trained per its Emergency Action Plan.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response Training that is refreshed annually.  WPS emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.

They are located at 4075 South Avenue 3 ? E just east of the Yuma Marine Corp Air Station. It is immediately surrounded by other cooling facilities and local farms. The overall site occupies 14 acres. It will include a total building space of 98250 square feet, 95,550 square feet for refrigerated storage and 2700 square feet for office or other non-refrigerated space. The facility was originally designed for the short-term storage and shipping of fresh berries but is upgrading to also include vacuum precooling, processing, and shipping of other local & seasonal fresh produce.  The primary commodities handled will include fresh berries and leafy greens.  Fire and life safety systems are engineered directly into the Plant as part of its design and building permit code compliance requirements.  Desert Fresh Cooling LLC is the operating entity and is owned by Field Fresh Farms 66.66% and WPS 33.33%. Portable equipment is either owned in partnerships and leased to DFC; or leased from WPS.  WPS is a regional, well-known & reputable supplier of portable refrigerating equipment.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is the refrigerant utilized in the systems described above, which consists of the stationary facility and portable high-side compressing/condensing trailer, plus two portable closed-loop vacuum cooling plants which are independent from the Cooler.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located outside (Compressors, Vessels, Condensers, Vacuum Cooling Plants).  Cold Room evaporators are located inside refrigerated space; with associated valves and piping located on the roof.  The portable ammonia-handling equipment "

The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's online RMP/PSM Management solution called WBBM (Web-based Business Manager).\n\n\n\nMonitoring and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment is a coordinated effort. DFC personnel are responsible for day-to-day monitoring and operational maintenance.  WPS is the company that performs technical inspections & maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to tear down and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the work order system. Tasks are tracked through the work order system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, DFC and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia"

Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\n Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOver the years it became apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during an oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at system oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at DFC:\n\n\n\n- Automatic Cutouts and Isolation Valves: Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards. Refrigerating equipment includes automated cut-outs and isolation valves. The cut-outs are designed to shut down equipment prior to out-of-tolerance conditions being met. Isolation valves would help limit the impact of a release scenario.\n\n- Monitoring & Alarm System: refrigerated building space is equipped with ammonia sensors and a monitored alarm system.\n\n- Ammonia Diffusion System: Pressure Relief Valves (PRV) are piped to an ammonia-water diffusion system.  If a PRV were to operate due to an over-pressure situation, the ammonia would be captured in the water tank.\n\n- Entrance to the facility is closely monitored via CCTV.   \n\n- Security Program: DFC has established a comprehensive food safety program that includes provisions for security, including closed-circuit television (CCTV's) and monitoring.\n\n- Refrigerating equipment is protected via barriers and equipment placement (siting) practices \n\n- Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc.  Training is documented in employee training record files.\n\n- Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeepin"
