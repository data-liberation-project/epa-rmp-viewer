      "SummaryText": "The Pleasant Prairie Power Plant is a coal-fired steam electric generating facility that generates electricity for distribution on the Wisconsin Electric Power Company (doing business as We Energies) system.  We Energies has constructed a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) pollution control system on Unit 2 to control emissions of nitrogen oxides. The SCR system utilizes aqueous ammonia (greater than 20% concentration) which is contained in two ammonia storage tanks and is injected into the exiting flue gas (exhaust gas) from the boiler system. The ammonia reacts with the nitrogen oxides to form harmless nitrogen gas and water vapor.  The SCR system requires ammonia to operate such that the amount of aqueous ammonia in the ammonia storage tanks at any given time exceeds the threshold value specified in EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  Releases from the ammonia storage tanks, which are diked, were evaluated as required by the RMP regulations. The dikedtanks would minimize the pooled surface area created by a release, thereby reducing the amount of ammonia that could be released into the surrounding atmosphere and minimizing off-site impacts. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANNING: The facility's prevention and emergency response approach includes the implementation of U.S. EPA's RMP regulations, OSHA process safety management program, and emergency response procedures developed specifically for the facility by the We Energies and the Kenosha County Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC).  Continuing employee safety training ensures the ongoing commitment to continual safety improvement. The facility has personnel trained in OSHA HAZWOPER emergency response requirements and has a designated outside emergency response contractor. The ammonia storage tanks are diked to minimize health and environmental impact should a release occur.  It is We Energies' policy to not only adhere to all applicable Federal, Stat"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY: On July 10, 2003, a plant employee was injured while performing maintenance on the aqueous ammonia system strainer baskets.  The details of that incident are provided in Section 6 - Accident History of the RMP."
