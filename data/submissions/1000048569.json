Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Ag Partners in Pine Island are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\n\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\n\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Pine Island Fire Department, which\n\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in 30,000- and 18,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in Pine Island\n\n(Figure 1).
