This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\n\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\n\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Pine Island Fire Department, which\n\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in 30,000- and 18,000-gallon interconnected tanks at our facility in Pine Island\n\n(Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 39,840 gallons (205,016.64 pounds) at the maximum\n\nfill capacity of 83%.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as sensitive information as requested by EPA.\n\n\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.
