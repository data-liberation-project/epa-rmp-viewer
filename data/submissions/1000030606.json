Facility Policy\n\nThe owner, management and employees of Riverside Fertilizer and Propane are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Greeley County LEPC, and/or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for the sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 200,000 pounds in the storage and nurse tanks.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst-case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of ten minutes.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous released would be 132,600 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) with a wind of 1.5 m/s is four miles.\n\n\n\nB.  The alternate release scenario is a one inch transfer hose failure that releaseses ammonia for 2 minutes before automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes, or a manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2900 pounds of ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) with a wind of 1.5 m/sec is .3 mile.\n\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, In"

Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor, has there been any accidental releases resultiing in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan\n\nRiverside Fertilizer and Propane has:\n\nA.  A written action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38\n\nB.  Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n7.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
