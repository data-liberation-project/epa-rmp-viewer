These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the plant. \n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS). This information is supplemented by documents that address known concerns and hazards associated with inadvertent mixing of specific chemicals. Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\n\nGeorgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC maintains an electronic database accessible by both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information combined with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not comprised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nGeorgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and co"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n \nThe facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are made available to those individuals associated with the process unit for comments and forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked through completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperators, supervisors, and plant engineers work together to develop and maintain operating procedures. These procedures define how tasks related to process operations are safely performed. At Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC, operating procedures are: (1) used to train employees, and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\nOperating procedures include:\n- Steps for safely conducting activities,\n- Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits,\n- Safety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personnel protective equipment requi"

The training program includes both initial and refresher training.\n\nAll new operators receive comprehensive training before being assigned to the operating unit. This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process, detailed review of plant procedures, such as, safe work practices and emergency response. Written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training material before a new employee can report to a process unit. \n\nOnce the new employee reports to the unit, detailed training with respect to the process and specific procedures is given to the employee. Once the new hire has demonstrated, through written tests and demonstration of learned skills, mastery of process specific operating procedures, the employee is allowed to begin work.\n \nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and, (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process. The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure the safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in service. The review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nGeorgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, emergency shutdown systems, and rotating equipment in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies and, (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work"
