      "SummaryText": "     Nichols Agriservice has always surpassed state regulations on anydrous ammonia training and operations.  All employees are trained yearly on the safety of anhydrous ammonia.  The training covers proper handling and what to do in case of an emergency.  The Nichols Fire Department visits the palnt two times a year to train new firemen and discuss what to do in case of accidental release of product.  We also had Farmland Insurance train the fire department at our facility.  We have emergency shut offs on our liquid shut offs on the riser in case a hose is pulled away from the loading location.  Nichols Agriservice LLC has an emergency action plan filed with our LEPC and our fire department in case of an accidental release.  This plan is updated on a yearly basis.  We have operated for 25 years without a release or injury at the plant.  We shall continue to do our very best to protect our employees, customers and people around our facility."
