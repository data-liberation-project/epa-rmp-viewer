Aqueous ammonia is stored onsite in liquid form in an above ground storage tank inside a secondary containment structure. Aqueous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control in the water and corn mash slurry as well as a nutrient for the growing yeast in fermentation. The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored is approximately 269,000 pounds (24 percent ammonia in water solution). The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) blended with ethanol at approximately 2.5% to render the product unfit for human consumption prior to shipping.  Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Stockton, LLC include pentane (exceeds 10,000 pound threshold). The pentane is in a flammable mixture of Natural Gasoline (Denaturant).
