The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.)To save lives.\n2.)To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.)To protect the environment.\n4.)To minimize property damage.\n\nRobert Mondavi Winery maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and Cal-ARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility has been in operation since 1978.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration systems were designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code.  The facility is located at 5950 Woodbridge Road, Acampo, California 95220.  Two plants are located at the facility, Plant 1 and Plant 2.\n\nIn Plant 1 the refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to two high pressure receivers (HPRs).  Liquid is again transferred from HPRs to two low pressure recirculators (LPR-1 and LPR-2) and the wine chillers.  Associated with LPR-1 is a liquid transfer vessel (LTV) where excess liquid ammonia can be routed back to the HPRs.  Pumped liquid is sent to a wine chiller and jacketed tanks.  The se"

      "SummaryText": "cond low pressure recirculator (LPR-2) pumps low pressure ammonia to the remaining jacketed tanks.  The vapor generated from the heat transfer from the process equipment (chillers and jacketed tanks) is returned to each accumulator, respectively in which constant pressures are maintained by back pressure regulating valves.  The vapor from the accumulators is then pulled to the compressors (4) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers (5) where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver (TSR) and HPRs.  The liquid ammonia in the thermosyphon receiver is used to cool the oil in the two FES screw compressors.  Liquid ammonia flows into the oil cooler vessel and the vapor/liquid mixture is syphoned back to the TSR.  A portable auto purger is used to remove non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The purger is mounted on a portable rack and can be used at both Plant 1 and Plant 2.  As the pressure in the process increases, the purger is connected and left to run for approximately one week to remove any non-condensibles.  The process also has a fire dump box/control box which can be used in only an emergency situation to equalize the pressures between the low side and the high side, or to manually reduce the system pressure.\n\nIn Plant 2 the refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to a high pressure receiver (HPR).  Liquid is transferred from HPR to wine chillers (21) and glycol chillers (4).  Vapor from the chillers is returned to two suction accumulators both equipped with a liquid transfer vessel.

The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in Plant 2 is 73,500 pounds.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY\n\nWorst Case Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A worst case release scenario was performed for Plants 1 and 2.  The worst case from Plant 1 had less downwind impact than Plant 2, and therefore, Plant 2 was deemed the worst case for the facility.  This release is the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in a vessel - 24,300 pounds in 10 minutes.  The high pressure receiver in Plant 2 is not enclosed and therefore passive mitigation measures can not be taken into account.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used: 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The SLAB modeling program was used to calculate the downwind distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n\nScenario Description: A release of ammonia gas from 1/4 inch diameter leak.  It is assumed that this release is from the high side of the system, therefore, a maximum pressure of 180 psig.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 100 pounds per minute.  No passive mitigation measures were considered becuase the ammonia system is located outside and not enclosed by a building.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability class.  The SLAB modeling program was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm in rural conditions.  This release reaches offsite and may affect public receptors.  No environmental receptors were affected by this potential release.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRobert Mondavi Wi"

In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred at the Robert Mondavi Winery facility in the last five years (June 1994 to June 1999). \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRobert Mondavi Winery has an emergency response plan for the facility.  If a release of ammonia were to occur, the facility will determine the extent of the emergency.   Supervisors will contact employees in their department to shut off equipment and evacuate to the designated meeting areas.   Plant management will call 911 in order to reach the Fire Department HazMat team who will respond to the ammonia release.  All employees are trained annually in the emergency evacuation/response plan.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provided the mitigation measures outlined below to improve safety at the Robert Mondavi Winery.   The PHA was comprised of two sessions that included a HAZOP study, a Plant Walkthrough, a \"What-if\" analysis, and a series of checklists.  All mitigation measures are expected to be complete by June 2000.  The following recommendations were made as a result of this Program:\n\n*RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED*\n\nConsider feasibility of remotely shutting down the compressors (i.e. remote emergency shut down switch or power source) and ensure that this procedure is included in the emergency response program.\n\nEnsure that employee training includes alerting maintenance person"

      "SummaryText": "\nInclude in Employee Training documentation for worker to sign showing that they had training in a certain operation.\n\nFollow the manufacturer's maintenance procedures.\n\n*SOON TO BE IMPLEMENTED*\n\nCoordinate with the fire department such that they would supply the third person equipped with a SCBA for emergency response.\n\nInform all office personnel at the facility that ammonia is present, the smell associated with it, and what to do if they smell ammonia.    \n\nReplace or recertify relief valves on jacketed tanks every ten years unless there are problems or a valve unseats.  Since the jacketed tanks are on the low pressure side of the refrigeration system, it is highly unlikely that relief valves will unseat. This policy can also be applied to the relief valves that are vented back to the suction side of the system.\n\nProvide protection around site glasses on the High Pressure Receiver.\n\nLabel all key valves, vessels, and piping in the system.  Where appropriate, indicate the direction of ammonia flow.  \n\nEnsure that the eye wash station is replaced to the shower hook up at ground level following the expansion in Plant 1.\n\nProvide operators with portable eye wash bottles when working on elevated areas.\n\nConsider installing an eye wash/shower in the Plant 2 machine area.\n\nConsider installing another 10 minute emergency escape mask and goggles with the present one.\n\nInclude in the Mechanical Integrity program that operator notifies someone when they are opening the system."
