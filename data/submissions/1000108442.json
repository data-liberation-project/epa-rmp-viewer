Efforts are assisted by the Corporate Director of PSM, Corporate Senior Manager: Process Safety management, and the facility PSM Specialist.  All facilities with ammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule maintain coverage of trained Ammonia Refrigeration Operators. Additional support is available via phone from management personnel s well as our contractor partners.\n\nThis facility manufactures frozen Asian foods.  The refrigeration system uses anhydrous ammonia, operating in a 2-stage Carnot cycle.\n\nWorst case and an alternate release scenarios are calculated using RMP*comp and urban conditions. The worst case using EPA guidance assumes the release of the entire charge through a capital vessel. The alternate release guidance utilizes the release of ammonia vapor through the largest relief valve.\n\nThe refrigeration system is covered by OSHA PSM rule, 29CFR 1910.119.\n\nThere have been no releases that have resulted in onsite or offsite casualties or offsite evacuations in the last five year reporting period. \n\nFacility personnel are regularly trained in their responsibilities under our emergency Response Plan. \n\nWe have a very active PSM / RMP Team. They meet monthly to certify policies and procedures, track deficiency items, and generally manage our PSM / RMP program. This team is led by our PSM Specialists. Many facility groups are represented in the monthly meeting including Environmental Health and Safety, Refrigeration Operations (Operators), Refrigeration Management, maintenance management, and general plant operations.\n\nThe worst case and alternate release scenarios have been chosen per industry guidelines.
