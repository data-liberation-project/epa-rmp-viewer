If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepaired to work with the local fire department and other emergency authorities, and to help mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the enviroment.\n\nFacility Information\nThe primary activity of our business is a grain handleing storage business and to relail feed and fertilizer to the agriculture sector.  The maximum quanity that would be stored at our facility would be 78795 pounds of anhydrous in the 18000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quanity that would be handled during unlaoding of a semi-truck holding 40,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case senario would release the total contents of our storage tank, released as gas over 10 minutes.   the maximum quanity would be 78,795 pounds, which represnts our storage tank at 85% as limited by the design standards.  The distance to endpiont ( point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .1.89 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on a five year history would be a relese from a transfer line failer.  The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion 200 ppm) is .83\n\nAccidental relase prevention program\nOur company has implimented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by The National Standards Institute Inc., and the standards of the US Occupational Safety and Health Administation (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nOur company stives to mainatian our excellent safety record, there has been no accidentail releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years, that has caused any deaths, injuries or significant proprty damage.  To our knowledge there has been no off-site injuries, evacuations,  deaths or enviromental damage.\n\nOur comapany completes yearly training, ma"
