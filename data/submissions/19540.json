      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan has been developed for The City of St. Martinville Water Treatment Plant in accordance with 40 CFR part 68.  This facility is subject to the requirements of this program due to the usage and storage of chlorine in an amount greater than 2,500 lbs.\n\nThe facility is located at 1220 Aubrey Ozenne Rd. approximately 3.7 miles northwesterly of St. Martinville, LA.  A sparsely populated residential area and swampland surround the plant.  The latitude and longitude coordinates of the facility were obtained from the USGS quadrangle map entitled Broussard, LA.\n\nThe facility treats and supplies water to residential and commercial entities located in St. Martinville and adjacent areas.  This treatment includes the chlorination of the water supply prior to being distributed throughout the system.  The chlorine is injected into the water at a constant rate that varies from 160 to 170 lbs./day based on the current needs.  Once the chlorine is injected into the water it is diluted to an amount which is less than 1% chlorine by weight.  Therefore, the process that is subject to the RMP requirements begins with the chlorine supply and ends at the point of injection into the water.  The facility purchases the pre-filled chlorine cylinders from DPC Enterprises, L.P. approximately once every month.  The water plant stores a maximum of two-one ton cylinders (4,000 lbs.) at any one time. The cylinders are located adjacent to the chlorination building on a concrete slab within the southwest corner of the plant.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would involve the release of the greatest amount from a single vessel as required by 40 CFR part 68.25 (b)-Determination of worst-case release quantity. This type of release may occur as a result of a catastrophic natural or other unforeseen disaster. The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/L as determined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.  This is the concentration at which minimal effects of exposure to "

This distance encompasses the area surrounding the plant from Hwy 96 at Aubrey-Ozenne Rd. to  the Cypress Island Coulee approximately 1.3 miles north of the plant and from Hwy 353 to Bayou Tortue Rd. approximately 0.3 miles into Lafayette Parish.  Based on an average population density of 300 p/sq-mi, according to Tiger Map Services (a census bureau service) the population within 1.3 miles of the facility is approximately 1500.\n\nAn alternative case or a more likely release of chlorine could occur as a result of a valve, fitting, regulator seal, or gasket leak, or from a small amount of liquefied chlorine being trapped between the valve of the cylinder and the equipment regulator head.  The plant superintendent visually inspects the process for leaks at least three times each day. The maximum time period between daily inspections is 12 hours.  Assuming the chlorine flashes to the atmosphere at a rate of 0.5 ft3/min for a maximum of 12 hours (72 lbs. of chlorine) the distance to the toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 mile.  The area within 0.1 mile of the facility consists mostly of swampland, wooded areas and nearby residences.  Based on an  average population density of 300 p/sq-mi, the population within 0.1 mile of the facility is approximately 10.  This type of release is only expected to slightly impact those persons in the immediate vicinity of the chlorine cylinders.  \n\nThe facility has not experienced a release that caused on or off site injury, death or property damage within the past five years.  \n\nFacility employees are properly trained in the operating and maintenance procedures.  These procedures are kept on-site within manuals developed by Dubroc Engineering, Inc. in accordance with vendor and state standards.  Records of inspections, testing, and maintenance are also kept on file at the facility.  \n\nThe St. Mar"

      "SummaryText": "tinville Water Treatment Plant has a written \"Chlorine Release Action Plan\" which has been coordinated by the St. Martinville Fire Department and surrounding fire departments.  Additional notification procedures are provided to all plant employees\n\nThe facility is equipped with an automatic vacuum type chlorination system.  When the water wells are operating, a vacuum is created in the system by a booster pump.  When a vacuum is present, the control valve at the chlorine tank opens, and chlorine is supplied to the water system.  If a vacuum within the chlorine injection system is not detected, the system remains closed.  If any leaks are present in the chlorine injection line, the control valve at the tank remains closed due to a lack of vacuum.  Also, inspections of the process and associated equipment are conducted on a daily basis to avoid failure and to detect normal wear and tear of equipment parts.  These inspections are performed by at least one of the four plant operators.  The operators of the plant are certified by the State Department of Health and Hospitals for water treatment operation and under go safety training on a regular basis.\n\nFacilities with worst-case release scenarios that affect public or environmental receptors but that are not subject to OSHA's process safety management program are required to develop a Program 2 RMP.  The City of St. Martinville Water Treatment Plant:\n\n7 Is not governed by OSHA because it is a publicly owned municipality\n7 Contains public receptors within its worst-case release circle\n\nTherefore, the information contained in this submittal shall serve to comply with the requirements of a Program 2 Risk Management Plan."
