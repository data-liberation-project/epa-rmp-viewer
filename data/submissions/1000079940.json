Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. Passive mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios\r\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\n \r\nProcess Description\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of liquid ammonia from the Condensers (6) to the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver (V-1).  A bevy located at the top of the vessel maintains a reservoir of liquid ammonia for thermosyphon oil cooling of the Compressors and any excess liquid overflows to the main storage portion of the vessel.

A liquid float switch connected to the liquid inlet from the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver (V-1) maintains the level of the bath of ammonia within the Intercooler (V-2).  In the event of a high level situation within the Intercooler (V-2) liquid can be transferred back to the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver (V-1) via the Transfer Drum (V-3). The transfer cycle is initiated when a three-way valve, which vents vapor in the Transfer Drum (V-3) back to the Intercooler (V-2) during normal operation, closes the vent line and allows hot gas to pressurize the Transfer Drum (V-3) before pumping the liquid back to the Thermosyphon/ High Pressure Receiver (V-1).

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S - Aberdeen to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S - Aberdeen's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfi"

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room which will alert operators in the event of a low-level ammonia detection and cease operation of the refrigeration system in the event of a high-level detection.  There are also ammonia detectors located throughout the freezer warehouse that will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection in those locations.  An off-site alarm company monitors the ammonia detection system while the facility is unmanned.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the off-site alarm company will notify the Maintenance Manager and Refrigeration Technicians.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no significant releases of ammonia at the Facility in the last five years (June 2014 - June 2019) of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. The Facility is non-responding and has personnel trained to support the HazMat response team if required (up to 300 ppm of ammonia).\r\nThere is a specific program (CEHS-0042) which outlines the training, qualifications and procedures for authorized ammonia Incident responders and observers.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIn April 1999, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, three Revalidations of th"
