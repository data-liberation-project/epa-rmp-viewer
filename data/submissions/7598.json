      "SummaryText": "Piney Point Phosphates, Inc. (PPPI) is a granular fertilizer manufacturing facility located at 13300 U.S. Highway 41 North, Palmetto, Florida. The facility is situated in  northern Manatee County approximately one mile south of the Hillsborough County line and just east of Port Manatee. Approximately one mile inland from the southeastern shoreline of Tampa Bay.\n\nManufacturing operations at the facility are conducted 24 hours per day on a year round basis.  Approximately 155 employees at the facility are spread over 3 eight hour shifts each day.  These employees operate, maintain and perform administrative functions for PPPI.  In addition to regular employees, contract employees are utilized for various functions.\n\nThe facility consists of a sulfuric acid plant (SAP), a phosphoric acid plant (PAP), a granular fertilizer plant (fertilizer plant), phosphogypsum stack system, warehouses, repair shops, offices, and ancillary structures.  Diammonium phosphate fertilizer (DAP), a granular fertilizer, is the facility's primary product.\n\nProduction of DAP utilizes anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), a chemical subject to the regulations found in 40 CFR part 68 (as promulgated in Section 112r of the Clean Air Act).\n\nGranular fertilizers are produced by neutralizing phosphoric acid with ammonia in a reactor located in the fertilizer plant.  Ammonia is received for storage at the facility by truck or rail and stored on-site as a liquid at ambient temperatures prior to usage.  Up to 320 tons of ammonia may be stored at the facility.\n\nTo minimize the potential to impact the public surrounding the facility, PPPI keeps less than a 24 hour supply of ammonia on hand.  However, due to the quantities consumed in the process and the fact that no transmission line is available, it is necessary to store ammonia in volumes exceeding the 10,000 pound threshold limit as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.130, Table 1 .\n\nIn June 1999, the facility will resume manufacturing DAP.

No accidental release of substances regulated as \"hazardous\" has occurred during this period.  The facility has been staffed to operate the water management systems and perform maintenance actions during this time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\n40 CFR Part 68 at Subpart \"B\" requires facilities that store over 10,000 pounds of ammonia to prepare an \"Off-site Consequence Analysis\" (OCA).  This OCA includes both a \"Worst Case Scenario\" analysis and an \"Alternative Release Scenario\" analysis utilizing physical parameters determined by the USEPA along with information supplied by the facility.  These analyses are made by utilizing \"look-up tables\" provided by USEPA or by numeric modeling using commercially available models.\n\nUSEPA \"look-up tables\" and the models estimate a distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm) for ammonia. The toxic endpoint concentration of 200 ppm has been set by USEPA in regulations found at 40 CFR 68 Appendix \"A\".  No data to support the 200 ppm toxic endpoint is provided or referenced by USEPA. \n\nThe OCA for the PPPI facility was prepared using the HGSYSTEM model. The modeling was performed by an independent consulting firm. Ammonia quantities were determined by the facility, physical parameters were set by USEPA guidelines.\n\nThe worst case scenario, OCA was completed assuming 640,000 pounds of  ammonia were released in vaporous form from two interconnected tanks over a 10 minute period.  Using the parameters mandated by the EPA, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint concentration of 200 ppm was 2.7 miles.  \n\nComparison of model results with USEPA's look-up tables or with other available models yields highly varying results.  Therefore, these endpoints and distances should only be utilized for planning purposes. Assumptions of physical parameters such as wind speed, ambient temperature, and surface roughness also effect look-up table and model re"

This longer period of time for the ammonia to reach a vaporous phase would greatly reduce the distance to the endpoint concentration. It would however increase the overall time of the release event.\n\nThe alternative case scenario was performed assuming a pipe failure causing the release of 12,600 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period.  Under this scenario the release would be terminated by closing an emergency valve.  Using a wind speed of two meters per second, the distance to the endpoint concentration was estimated to be 0.43 miles.  Using this distance the endpoint would be contained onsite in all directions except west where it would reach just beyond U.S. Highway 41. \n\nPPPI has in place other mitigation systems which would reduce the distance to the endpoint.  These mitigation systems which were not incorporated in the modeling, include a water curtain system, excess flow valves, and  drain system directing discharged ammonia to a PPPI process water pond. \nThese mitigation systems do not however supplant continuous monitoring by personnel, effective maintenance practices, or good work and safety practices. \n\nThese in-place mitigation systems would decrease the quantity of an ammonia release by several ways.  Ammonia is highly soluble in water, therefore, methods to mix ammonia with water are very effective in reducing the release volume.  Both the water curtain (sprayed fresh water) and the drain to the process water ditch result in released ammonia being captured in water thereby reducing the quantity available for a gaseous release.\n\nThe ammonia storage and distribution system is equipped with self-closing excess fl"

These employees have been trained to use emergency responder equipment, level A, B, & C protective equipment including encapsulated suits, and S.C.B.A. equipment in staged release drills.  All shift supervisors, day supervisors, superintendents and electrical employees have completed an 8 hour class on basic first aid & CPR.\n\nContractors working at the PPPI facility complete a 16 hour safety class for fertilizer industry facilities conducted by Polk Community College and attend a facility site specific safety class presented by the facility safety supervisor.

This program is formulated to meet the requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 for process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nPPPI, has an Emergency Response Plan which contains those elements required under OSHA & EPA's Standards.  The emergency response plan acts as a guideline to direct internal response and reporting activities at the direction of specific on-site personnel, in the event of a release emergency. The plan includes federal, state and county agencies to be  contacted in an emergency in addition to company managers that must be notified in the event of a release.

PPPI recently enhanced communication between the facility and local responders by supplying the local fire department (NRFD District II) with a company radio.  This direct communication link will allow NRFD immediate information should a release occur.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program: \n\nPPPI complies with all OSHA safety and health standards listed in CFR 29 Part 1910, as well as any other federal, state and county regulations that are applicable to the fertilizer industry.\n     \nBoth operations and maintenance departments have detailed written operational, maintenance, and inspection programs in keeping with OSHA requirements.
