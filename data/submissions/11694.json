The same \nproperties that make chlorine valuable as a treatment process chemical also make it necessary to observe\ncertain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to to our own personal health as well as that of others, and to reduce the threat to our nearby community.     It is the policy of Lake Township Water System to adhere to all applicable Federal, state, and local rules and regulations.      Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures used, and the training of Lake Township personnel.\n\n2.      The stationary source and chlorine handling.\nThe primary purpose of the Lake Township Waterplant is to treat drinking water.    Chlorien is received by lift-gate truck.    It is then used in the disinfection of drinkinhg water.    This facility has no equipment for unloading one ton cylinders but does have equipment to place and remove containers on the scales.   Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and one authorized contractor.     The maximum totoal inventory of chlorine stored at the waterplant is 4000 pounds.\n\n3.      The worst case scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\nWorst Case Scenario -  within a determined toxic endpoint radius of 1.3 miles, the estimated residential population, the public receptors, and the environmental receptors were determined.\nAlternative Release Scenario - this is based on the one most likely to occur.     The scenario distance has only the potential to extend to the buildings and grounds of the waterplant.\n\n4.      The general accidental r"

No incidents.\n\n6.      The emergency response program.\nThe CERP of the Lake Township Water System is based upon guidelines found in the Federal Register.      It has been reviewed by the Lake Township Fire Department, our insurance agetn, and others.      Six of the employees are trained in HAZWOPER and so are four firemen, three of which are employed at the waterplant.\n\n7.      Planned changes to improve safety.\nThe waterplant was built in 1974 and continues to offer safety training once or more per month per employee.      This training also includes new equipment and procedures."
