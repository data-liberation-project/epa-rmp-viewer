      "SummaryText": "1. Corporate Prevention and Emergency Response Approach\n\nThe Pine Hills Water Treatment Plant (Pine Hills) is owned by the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC).  The facility has developed and maintains accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan to prevent and mitigate the effects of hazardous chemical releases.  The OUC Corporate Environmental Department provides advice and funding on hazardous chemical emergency issues.  The OUC Response to chlorine emergencies is coordinated through the Water Production Division Pershing Control Center, from which all OUC Water Plants are controlled and managed.\n\n2. Description of Stationary Source\n\nThe Pine Hills plant is located on at 5601 Santa Anita Street, Orlando, Orange County, Florida.  Pine Hills adds chlorine through their chlorination process in order to disinfect the City's water supply.\n\nLiquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to twenty one-ton containers at the Chlorination process building.   Five one-ton containers are on-line at all times feeding the system, with five containers on standby to draw from when the first five are exhausted.  There are ten more one-ton containers in storage.   The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time is 40,000 lbs.  This is greater than the 2,500 lb. RMP threshold quantity for chlorine.  This process is fully enclosed in a building. \n\nThe chlorine building at Pine Hills is equipped with an automated chlorine scrubber system.  The scrubber system is activated by two chlorine detectors which are located inside the building, one in the chlorine dock area and one in the chlorination room.  If the chlorine detectors indicate that chlorine is present at a concentration above the preset level, the doors and louvers of the building will automatically close and the scrubber will start.  The scrubber fan will pull the released chlorine gas through the scrubber, which chemically removes the chlorine from the air.  The scrubber can handle a full one-ton contain"

The chlorine detectors are also interlocked to an audible and visual alarm at the site and audible and visual alarms on the Operator\u00bfs control panel at the Pershing Control Center.  The Control Panel will also indicate to the operator that the scrubber has started.  When the Operator sees the chlorine alarm, he can dispatch OUC personnel and County emergency response personnel to the site immediately if necessary.\n\n\n3. Prevention Program\n\nFor the Chlorination process, this facility exceeds the chlorine threshold quantity of 1500 lbs. for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, 1910.119; however, this is an unoccupied facility and is therefore not subject to the PSM requirements.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Pine Hills Chlorination process in the Program 2 level.  The Pine Hills facility will address all elements for the Prevention Program 2 as required by the RMP rule.\n\nThe Prevention Program 2 contains the following elements: a Process Hazard Review of the process, the collection and documentation of Process Safety Information, a Preventative Maintenance Program, written Operating Procedures, a Compliance Audits program, Safety Training for operations and maintenance personnel, and an Incident Investigation procedure. This Prevention Program will ensure continued safe operation and prompt correction of deficiencies.  The Prevention Program receives full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n4. Accident History\n\nThe Pine Hills facility has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Pershing Control Center has an Emergency Response Procedure in place.  The Plant Operator at the Pershing Control Center has accident assessment capabilities and can respond immediately to all emergencies by dispatching appropriate personnel to the site.  The OUC Water Production mechanics have been trained in chlo"
