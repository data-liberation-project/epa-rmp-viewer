System upgrades have been performed to enhance safety, reliability and control.   \n\nThis facility has had no reportable accidental chlorine releases in the last ten years.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worse case release and alternate release scenarios.  The modeling software used was the EPA's RMP Comp for both scenarios.  The worst case release scenario followed conditions predefined by the EPA, namely a release of one entire container in 10 minutes.  Even though this scenario is highly unlikely, it provides useful data for planning purposes.  Due to our control and monitoring systems, safe operations and procedures, this plant has never had a release that has affected any offsite residences. \n\nThe alternate release scenario was selected because it considers a valve leak that has occurred with one of our minor releases.  Although the release considered in this alternate scenario is much greater than any release we have had, it provides data for planning purposes.  The chlorine is contained in an enclosed room and this was used as a mitigation system in calculating the toxic endpoint.  \n\nAn emergency response procedure has been developed and reviewed by Yamhill County Emergency Services, McMinnville Fire Department and all members of the McMinnville Water & Light chlorine team.   The chlorine leak alarms are tested daily.  The chlorine team receives training and drills using the chlorine leak repair kit and self contained breathing apparatus.  Everyone on the chlorine team is knowledgeable of the written procedures and policies. \n\nMcMinnville Water & Light is committed to safety and considers this plan an excellent prevention plan for chlorine releases.

As a result of a comprehensive review during the design process, chlorine gas will no longer be used as the disinfectant. The estimated date for the transition from chlorine gas to on-site sodium hypochlorite generation is expected to be January 2010. When chlorine gas is no longer used or stored at Haskins Creek (Norman R. Scott) Water Treatment Plant, McMinnville Water & Light will proceed to de-register this facility in accordance with EPA requirements."

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nMcMinnville Water and Light is a public utility that provides water and electricity to McMinnville, Oregon.  McMinnville is a community of approximately 32,000 people in northwest Oregon. \n\nMcMinnville Water and Light is committed to safely producing very high quality water at a low cost.  To meet these goals all systems must be functioning properly, procedures must be followed, and employees must complete their work as safely as possible and follow all applicable regulations and procedures.\n\nThe water system is a gravity system with two surface water sources in the Coast Range Mountains, a Water Treatment Plant, 10 miles of transmission lines, 4 service reservoirs, and 90 miles of distribution system.\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant is a conventional dual-media filter plant that uses chlorine gas as the disinfectant.  The average amount of chlorine gas used in one day is less than 100 pounds.  One cylinder provides the chlorine and another tank is in standby ready for an automatic switch over should the primary tank empty.  Only two tanks are connected to the chlorine system at any time.  \n\nThe plant is continually monitored for safety, security and water quality.  This includes continuous monitoring of chlorine leak detectors and chlorine levels in the water. \n\nThis facility has been in operation since 1977.  Written procedures for handling chlorine tanks were developed and have been in use for years.  In addition, we have developed policies and procedures that meet the requirements of Risk Management Regulations and Process Safety Management Regulations.  These written plans have been coordinated with McMinnville Fire Department, the Yamhill County Emergency Services and the City of McMinnville.  All operators are aware of these procedures and have been trained to properly handle chlorine and any leak that might occur.  This training includes use of personal protective equipment as well as special tools required for these chlor"
