Morrow GA facility purifies and fills compressed specialty industrial gases in cylinders in both large and small quantities.  The source material gas which is transfilled and sometimes purified may be packaged in ton cylinder units (i.e. tonners) or regular cylinders, depending on the gas.  The finished product varies from a single pure chemical gas to gas mixtures, and the capacity of finished product cylinders varies from 2000 pounds to less than a few grams of gas depending on the size of the cylinder and the type of material involved.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas is committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the procedures necessary to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  In addition we are committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the emergency response procedures necessary to mitigate a release quickly and effectively if it occurs.  \n\nRegulated Chemicals and Processes\n\nThere are 44 chemicals at the Matheson Tri-Gas Morrow facility that could potentially be regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP).  (See Table 1)  Of the 44 chemicals, only one\u00bfchlorine--is present in two processes in sufficient quantity to be regulated under RMP.  The two processes are transfilling/purification and storage.    \n\n\nOCA - Removed\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Mitigation Measures\n\nThe major elements of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and release mitigation measures at this site are as follows:  (Each element pertains to all RMP-regulated processes at the facility.)\n\n\u00b7\tAdherence to objective equipment standards.  One of the most significant contributors to the prevention of accidental releases at this site is the high standard to which all gas cylinders must be manufactured.  The Department"

Cylinders must be manufactured according to a particular metallurgical standard and be able to withstand significant overfilling; increase in pressure; increase in temperature and the possibility that they will be hit or fall over.    \n\n\u00b7\tPiping and other equipment such as tanks associated with gas processes adheres to ASTM standards.  Toxic gas processing is done in exhausted enclosures that meet ventilation standards.  All residual gas is vented to scrubbers that are constructed to meet both air emission and fire code standards.  \n\n\u00b7\tProcess hazard analysis.  Process hazard analyses are performed on relevant processes to determine potential hazards and recommendations for process improvements.  \n\n\u00b7\tDevelopment and implementation of standard operating procedures.  \n\n\u00b7\tA comprehensive training program that includes classroom and on-the-job training. \n\n\u00b7\tA systematic preventive maintenance program.  All relevant equipment is on a schedule for inspection and inspections are documented. \n\n\u00b7\tA thorough accident reporting and investigation program.  The corporate accident/incident reporting and investigation procedure requires the reporting and investigation not only of incidents resulting in injuries, but also incidents that had the potential to result in an injury to an employee or a significant impact on the company's business. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one accidental release from RMP-regulated processes in the last five years at this facility.  A small amount of chlorine (less than 1 lb.) was released from a vent line on March 24, 2003.  One employee had minor nose and throat irritation.  The release did not damage property and did not impact people or property outside the plant boundaries.  \n \nEmergency Response Program\n\nThis facility's Emergency Response Program includes:  \n\nIdentification and location of hazardous materials.
