FHR's management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of its Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Port Arthur Complex (PAC or the \"facility\"), operated by Flint Hills Resources Port Arthur, LLC (FHR), is an olefins plant with the capacity to produce nearly 1.4 billion pounds per year of ethylene and 700 million pounds per year of chemical-grade propylene, which are both sold into the merchant market with pipeline access to many major delivery points in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the lower Mississippi River regions. Ethylene and propylene are basic chemical building blocks used to manufacture a variety of products such as trash bags, automotive parts, and medical devices.\n\n\n\nThe facility consists of four main processes:\n\n1. Light Olefins Unit (LOU),\n\n2. Aromatics Unit/Cyclohexane Unit (AU/CU),\n\n3. Utilities operation, and\n\n4. Offsite Tankage operation\n\n\n\nThere are approximately 28 EPA RMP regulated substances used at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantity; and is subject to the OSHA process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 .

These high standards include:\n\n   Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\n   Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\n   Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\n   Correcting findings identified in regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Prevention Program\n\nThe PAC Olefins Plant is operating under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program. Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety have contributed to process safety and the facility has only one RMP chemical release accidents over the last 5 years. Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases. A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n   Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator\n\n   Preventive maintenance and testing of vessels through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\n\n   Minimizing the possibility of a release of propylene with shutdown interlocks installed on process equipment.\n\n   Reducing the risk of cold embrittlement failure by upgrading the metallurgy of specific pieces of process equipment\n\n   Reducing the severity of fires with operation of automatic sprinkler and manual deluge systems.\n\n   Reducing the risk of overfillin"

However, there was one incident in 2011 that did result in on-site property damage.\n\n\n\nOn May 23, 2011 at 10:45 PM, a pump fire in the Light Olefins unit occurred resulting in an initiation of onsite emergency response, evacuation of the unit and resulting property damage. Approximately, 10,000 pounds of flammable chemicals were released. No injuries or offsite impacts occurred as a result of this accident. Details are shown in the table below.\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility continues to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary with the local Port Arthur Fire Department. As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the local Port Arthur Police Department, State Police, and other coordinating agencies, and local hospitals. The PAC facility Plant Manager and Plant Safety Manager are responsible for coordinating the emergency actions. A written and specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials. The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\n2.1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.
