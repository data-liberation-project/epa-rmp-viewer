As a result of this third-party audit, a RMP/PSM Team was formed to address the audit findings.  This team is currently performing a comprehensive review and revision of Stolthaven Houston's RMP/PSM program to better align the program with our current work practices.  As part of this comprehensive internal review, individuals at the facility have been assigned to each of the specific RMP/PSM program elements to promote responsibility and ownership.\r\n\r\n- Stolthaven Houston has also contracted with a safety consulting firm to facilitate the five-year Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation of the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.

      "SummaryText": "IVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding five years there has been one accidental release from a RMP covered process at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal which resulted in significant property damage on-site.  On the evening of August 23, 2013 nitrogen pressure was being used to unload a rail car containing TDI into one of Stolthaven Houston's on-site TDI storage tanks.  As the rail car was being unloaded, the rail switching crew on-duty coupled the terminal's locomotive to a string of rail cars, including the working TDI rail car, and began to pull the cars away from the rail rack.  As the rail car being emptied of TDI was moved, the TDI cargo hose released from the car, and the car's 1-inch valve connected to the plant nitrogen hose was sheared off.  Residual nitrogen pressure in the rail car caused approximately 4,500-gallons of TDI to be released from the sheared 1-inch valve opening on the rail car into the Rail Rack R-2 concrete containment area, with a small amount of TDI released onto an in-plant concrete road adjacent to the rack in the center of the facility.  There was no off-site release of TDI liquid.  A Stolthaven Houston operator on duty at Rail Rack R-2 immediately closed the rail rack TDI product line valve leading to the storage tank, and the TDI liquid release from the rail car stopped once the residual nitrogen pressure in the car reached atmospheric pressure.  A third party environmental response contractor was contacted within an hour of this release to assist with the necessary clean up efforts, which were completed on the late afternoon of August 27, 2013.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this incident, the following corrective actions were implemented by Stolthaven Houston Inc. after review by the terminal's Management Steering Committee:  (1) the TDI incident was discussed in detail at a mandatory meeting conducted at Rail Rack R-2 for all facility Operations, Waste Water, and Maintenance Department personnel, (2) Standard Operating Procedures rela"

As a result, the above-referenced Pentanes are not always present on-site at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  \r\n\r\nOur training and accidental release prevention programs in combination with our Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the potential hazards posed to our employees, the public, and the environment through the storage and/or transfer of the above-referenced RMP regulated chemicals.\r\n\r\nTOLUENE DIISOCYANATE STORAGE AND TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nStolthaven Houston Inc. currently stores Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI) in one 30,000-barrel nominal capacity above-ground storage tank (Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-30-10) and in one 15,000-barrel  nominal capacity above-ground storage tank (Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-15-22).  Tank D-30-10 has a fill-restricted maximum TDI storage capacity of approximately 10,600,000-pounds (1,042,000-gallons).  Tank D-15-22 has a fill-restricted maximum TDI storage capacity of approximately 5,131,000-pounds (504,500-gallons).  Periodic direct transfers of TDI from marine vessels into rail tank cars is also performed at Stolthaven Houston Inc. with no intermediate product storage.  Stolthaven Houston Inc. currently has over 18-years of experience in the storage and handling of TDI.  \r\n\r\nStolthaven Houston Inc. proposes to commence the storage of TDI in a third above-ground storage tank at the facility:  Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-15-19.  Storage Tank D-15-19 is an existing low-pressure tank that will have a fill-restricted maximum TDI working capacity of approximately 5,122,000-pounds (503,600-gallons).  TDI storage is currently projected to commence in Tank D-15-19 during the early second quarter"

      "SummaryText": "of 2014.  \r\n\r\nAs part of the changes associated with additional TDI storage, significant modifications will be performed such that TDI can be safely and efficiently handled in Low-Pressure Storage Tank D-15-19 at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal.  These changes to specific to TDI in Tank D-15-19 include:\r\n\r\n- Installing a liner on the storage tank's floor and shell\r\n\r\n- Installing a new line constructed of 316L stainless steel from the storage tank to the existing marine dock line in D-Manifold that is used exclusively for TDI marine-based transfers\r\n\r\n- Replacing all existing gate valves on the Tank D-15-19 system with new ball valves for ease of operation\r\n\r\n- Installing a new stainless steel pump for TDI at Storage Tank D-15-19\r\n\r\n- Installing new hot water external heating panels, a water tank, and associated heating panel supply/return lines for Storage Tank D-15-19 while in TDI service\r\n\r\n- Insulating Tank D-15-19\r\n\r\n- Installing internal eductors at the tank's recirculation line to improve product mixing\r\n\r\n- Installing electric tracing and insulation on the tank's lateral line to D-Manifold\r\n\r\n- Installing a dehydrator on the tank's vacuum breaker to help prevent moisture from entering the vapor space should there be a loss of plant nitrogen\r\n\r\n- Installing a carbon adsorption canister on the Storage Tank D-15-19 vapor line prior to the TDI vapors entering the terminal's common Tank Farm Vent Flare vapor header.  \r\n\r\nISO & NORMAL PENTANE INTERMODAL TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nIsopentane, n-Pentane, and Iso/Normal Pentane blends are periodically transloaded directly between land-based transportation containers (i.e. tank trucks, ISO tank containers, and rail tank cars) at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal's Rail Rack R-2 and Truck Rack T-6  with no intermediate tank product storage.  Vapors generated during these intermittent transfer operations are directed to the terminal's Tank Farm Vent Flare for pollution control.  \r\n\r\nVINYL ACETATE MONOMER STORAGE AND TRANSFERS\r\n\r\nStora"

      "SummaryText": "ge Tank P-50-5 is an existing internal floating roof (IFR) tank at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal with a maximum working capacity of approximately 50,142-barrels, which corresponds to a maximum VAM storage capacity of approximately 16,400,000-pounds.  Tank P-50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case VAM release scenario, was placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.  VAM is received into this tank via barge delivery using a dedicated marine dock line.  Product is stored and then shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  VAM may also be transferred periodically directly from barges to rail tank cars with no intermediate product storage, and VAM slops can also be received from marine vessels berthed at Stolthaven Houston.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of the 2010 VAM storage project for Tank P-50-5, piping modifications were completed in various facility manifolds and at Tank P-50-5 to eliminate the use of hoses in VAM service to the greatest extent possible within the terminal.  A VAM filter-pot was also installed adjacent to the storage tank.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P-50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water as-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable or combustible liquid storage tanks in close proximity.  Existing portable water delivery systems also remain available should they be needed in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was first conducted in December of 2008 and then again in April of 2009 in preparation of receiving this RMP regulated substance into the facility's A-Tank Farm in 2009.
