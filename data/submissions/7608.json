      "SummaryText": "Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the two most commonly used substances for treating wastewater.  The Yucaipa  Valley Water District Henry N. Wochholz Wastewater Treatment Plant (Yucaipa  WWTP) also uses chlorine (for chlorination) and sulfur dioxide (for dechlorination) for treating wastewater to provide safe water discharges to the environment.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide can create hazardous situations.  Yucaipa  WWTP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and sulfur dioxide as seriously as it takes in providing the environment safe disinfected water.  Yucaipa  WWTP's chlorine and sulfur dioxide handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.  These Programs require a summary in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  \n\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n7 Accidental release prevention and emergency responsepolicies.\n7 General facility and regulated substances information.\n7 Offsite consequence analysis results.\n7 Summary of the accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n7 Five-year accident history summary.\n7 Emergency response program summary.\n7 Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nThe above information for the Yucaipa  WWTP Chlorination and dechlorination Systems are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Yucaipa WWTP accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.

Yucaipa WWTP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for chlorine and sulfur dioxide to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.  The Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with local response agencies, such as the San Bernardino County Fire Department.  Yucaipa WWTP has an excellent record in preventing accidents from occurring.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Yucaipa WWTP is located on 880 W. County Line Road, in Yucaipa, California.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant has operated since 1986.  The design treatment capacity of the plant has increased in stages from the original 3.0 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) to current capacity of 4.5 mgd.  The wastewater treated at the Plant originates mainly from approximately 27,000 domestic and industrial users in the communities of Yucaipa, Calimesa, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. Wastewater treatment utilizes the activated sludge process with post-chlorination and dechlorination to yield a tertiary effluent for purposes of re-use and/or discharge.\n\nAnhydrous chlorine used for chlorination is delivered to the facility in one-ton containers and stored inside the chlorine storage room. Anhydrous sulfur dioxide used for dechlorination is also delivered to the facility in one-ton sulfur dioxide containers and stored inside the sulfur dioxide storage room.\n\nThe purpose of the chlorination system is to prevent the spread of"

The caustic scrubber system is activated in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nThe purpose of the dechlorination system is to inject sulfur dioxide solution into the plant effluent to dechlorinate the effluent.  This is done to meet the waste discharge requirements of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.  The sulfur dioxide system consists of eight one-ton sulfur dioxide containers, three sulfur dioxide detectors, two sulfonators and injectors, mixers, other piping and equipment, most of which is located in the chlorination/dechlorination building.  Sulfur dioxide is diffused into the effluent channel at the discharge of the chlorine contact tanks.

Access to the Yucaipa WWTP is through gates, which are closed after regular hours.\n\nYucaipa WWTP is also provided with an emergency generator.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nRMP and CalARP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint resulting from an accidental release of regulated toxic substances from covered processes.  For the worst-case release scenario analysis, two scenarios were considered: (1) complete de-inventory of a 1-ton chlorine container and (2) complete de-inventory of a 1-ton sulfur dioxide container.  A screening analysis performed using the EPA RMP*Comp software indicated that the toxic endpoint distance for the sulfur dioxide release would be larger in comparison to a chlorine release scenario.

The 1-ton (2,000 pound) of sulfur dioxide represents the worst-case release quantity over a 10-minute duration for the covered processes at the Yucaipa WWTP facility.  No passive mitigation measures were considered for estimating the release quantity of chlorine/sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere.  The release rate will, accordingly, be 200 lb./minute.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine/sulfur dioxide is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine/sulfur dioxide vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's Dense Gas Air Dispersion (DEGADIS 2.1) Model.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA and CalARP rules for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (115 deg F), and average relative humidity (59%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the air dispersion analysis indicate that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.  \n\nRMP and CalARP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario, unless no such scenario exists.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.

A review of the past five-year accident history data for the chlorination and dechlorination facilities pursuant to these rules indicated that there were no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases, which could have resulted in offsite (outside the Yucaipa  WWTP boundary) toxic endpoint distances.  Similarly, no credible accident scenario was identified from the process hazard analysis, which would reach offsite. \n\nThe scenarios selected for the Yucaipa  WWTP chlorination and dechlorination systems involve the release of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the pigtails connecting the ton containers to chlorination and dechlorination processes.  These scenarios can occur if the operator uses a pigtail, which is worn or has a defect, which results in a crack in the pigtail during the withdrawal of chlorine/sulfur dioxide from the ton containers.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the flex hose (diameter 0.25-inch) corresponds to a hole of 0.0625-inch (1/16 inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine/sulfur dioxide leak by the chlorine/sulfur dioxide monitors installed at the chlorination/dechlorination facility.  It is assumed that approximately thirty minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and close the ton container valve.\n\nThe chlorine release rate inside the storage room was estimated at 0.6 lb./min.

The results of the dispersion modeling analysis indicated that the maximum ground level one hour average concentration for both regulated substances (chlorine and sulfur dioxide) would be less than 0.5 ppm (0.03 ppm for chlorine and 0.10 ppm for sulfur dioxide).  These concentrations are significantly lower than 3 ppm, the toxic endpoints for chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and will have no offsite impacts.\n\nIt may be noted that the occurrence of these scenarios are highly unlikely because the pig-tails are inspected during each connection/disconnection operation, and during operator rounds.\nFinally, no chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases that could have caused safety or health hazard (no deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Yucaipa  WWTP during the last five years. \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nYucaipa  WWTP is in compliance with Federal and State Process Safety Management requirements.
