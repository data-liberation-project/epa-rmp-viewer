If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire & rescue department and LEPC or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\nFacility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application of fertilizer for crop production.\n\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 210,000 pounds in  storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n\nThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 31,000  pounds, which represents the volume of our storage tanks at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n     The alternative release scenario:a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shutdown valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .30 mile.\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility is in compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirments for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61 1, published by The American National Standards Institute, In., (ANSI), and the standards fo the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Adm"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenence and safe conditions of our equipment.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommenations at this time."
