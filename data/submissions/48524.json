XTO Energy demonstrates this commitment by investing our resources in accident prevention, by continuous safety training, and by placing a high value on safety during design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our goal is to implement reasonable goals to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  In the event of a release, trained company personnel will respond accordingly to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nPRCESS DESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant, located near Harleton, Texas, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (natural gas, propane, butane, and condensate) from natural gas.  Regulated flammables such as propane and butane are present but no regulated toxic substances are present at North Lansing Liquid.  The facility is a refrigeration unit using compressed propane to cool the incoming gas stream.  This liberates natural gas liquids which are separated in the three phase separator then stabilized in a tower using the glycol still as a heat source.  The stabilized liquids are stored and trucked to delivery.  The glycol is also used to inhibit freezing by injecting it into the inlet stream. The glycol is recovered in the three-phase separator and sent to the still to regenerate.  The gas off the three phase separator is cross exchanged with the inlet then sent to sales.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 2 processes at the North Lansing Liquid Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the inventory of the largest storage tank containing 30,000 gallons (159,000 lbs.).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.45 miles.  Although numero"

The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event is also 0.45 miles.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the North Lansing Liquid Plant. It is a small, unmanned skid-mounted natural gas refrigeration plant. The plant is subject to EPA's risk management program (RMP) Program 2.  The plant has more than a threshold quantity of flammable chemicals, e.g. natural gas and NGLs, in a process.  The North Lansing Liquid Plant is an entirely new facility but a small number of receptors are present within the distance to the worst-case release endpoint.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant uses a wide range of reference materials to maintain safe operation of each process.  These documents address specific chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\n\n\nHazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within the program, each process is analyzed to identify potential hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe hazard analysis is conducted by a company engineer with maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise of this type of facility. He analyzes and evaluates hazards of the processes, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measur"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to findings is based on relative risk ranking by the engineer.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to the engineer's hazard analysis findings are tracked until they're completed.  The final solution of each finding is documented and retained.  Hazard analysis findings will be reviewed anytime equipment or operating procedures are changed.  The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.  Once the engineer's findings are forwarded to management for consideration, the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant maintains written procedures that address process operations such as (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  The procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure accuracy.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the North Lansing Liquid Plant maintains written operating procedures, which are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo compliment the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through oral test, skills determination) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a "

The refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant has well-established practices for preventative maintenance of pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, and compressors.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) performing tests, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (4) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  Certified contractors will be used for vessel inspection and pressure relief valve testing.\n\n\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, and (4) emergency response plans to help ensure that work is performed in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help to ensure that equipment function as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing   the equipment back in service (if possible), or an engineer will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and to develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence and forward these results to facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the North Lansing   Liquid Plant conducts an audit every 3 years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit staff members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to North Lansing Liquid management for resolution.

The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The plan also "

      "SummaryText": "covers the sequential steps of addressing a potential fire, spill, tornado, and bomb threat.  The program addresses the responsibilities of each member of the emergency response team and outlines the network of communication to ensure success.  When necessary, the emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to gas plant processes.  The overall emergency response program for the North Lansing Liquid Plant is coordinated with the Harrison County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The facility has around-the-clock communications capability with the LEPC officials.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe North Lansing Liquid Plant resolves all findings from hazard analyses, some of which may result in modification to the process.  At the current time, any possible recommendations from hazard analyses will be completed prior to startup of the plant."
