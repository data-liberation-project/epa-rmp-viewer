      "SummaryText": "The City of Midland, Texas (City) operates the Midland Water Purification Plant (WPP or Facility).  The WPP is located at 5000 N Midland Drive in Midland, Midland County, Texas.  The WPP produces potable water for the City of Midland.  Chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia are used in the disinfection process at the WPP.  Up to 48,000 pounds of chlorine and 18,682 pounds of anhydrous ammonia may be stored at the WPP.  Because the stored quantity of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia onsite exceeds their threshold quantities (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The WPP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c); \u00a768.155(b)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Assistant Utilities Director is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date.  The City's accidental release prevention and emergency response policies include a commitment to safety and to implementation of safe procedures to ensure accidental releases of chlorine and anhydrous ammonia gas are prevented.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention program (Prevention Program) includes required elements of 40 CFR Part 68 such as safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation.  Detailed documentation of each element of the Prevention Program is contained within the text of the RMP.  Operator training is key to the effectiveness of the Prevention Program.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WPP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work"

      "SummaryText": "with chlorine and ammonia storage and feed systems.  Certified WPP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine and ammonia systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WPP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the WPP has not had a chlorine or ammonia release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a); \u00a768.155(d)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58; \u00a768.155(f)). In addition, the conversion from anhydrous ammonia to liquid ammonia sulfate at the WPP is planned in the future to improve safety (\u00a768.155(f)).\r\n\r\nThe WPP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute and American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  The WPP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Facility is included in the City-County Emergency Response Plan.  The WPP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a \"man down\" and to notify their supervisor in the event of suspected release.  The Plant Superintendent will notify 9-1-1 in the event of a verified release from the WPP.  The City of Midland's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the City-County Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b); \u00a768.155(a) and (e))."
