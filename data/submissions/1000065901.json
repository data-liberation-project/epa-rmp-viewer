      "SummaryText": "The FCC facility is committed to safely operating its facility to protect its employees, the public, and the environment. EPA requires regulated facilities to submit RMP describing the risk management program at its facilities. This executive summary is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management system at the facility.\r\n\r\nFirst Chemical Corporation and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe FCC is located near Bayou Casotte Industrial Park in Jackson County, Mississippi. The facility manufactures chemicals such as nitric acid, nitrobenzene, aniline, and, on a batch basis, specialty chemicals. These chemicals are the key ingredients in many items you use every day, including pharmaceutical, automotive parts, tires, dyes, photo chemicals, agricultural chemicals and building materials.\r\n\r\nFCC has two chemicals on-site that exceed the threshold quantity of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as established in the 1990 Clean Air Act Section 112(r) and describes in detail in 40 CFR 68. Those chemicals are anhydrous ammonia and chlorine. \r\n\r\nThere is no flammable gas worst-case release scenario because FCC does not store any RMP flammable chemicals above the threshold quantity. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policy\r\n\r\nIf either of these highly unlikely events ever occurred, FCC has an Emergency Response Plan in place. FCC utilizes OSHA's PSM program to reduce the likelihood that this worst-case release or the alternative release never occurs. There are formal review programs beginning with the initial determination to produce a product, continue through the entire pre-manufacture process, and are ongoing after manufacture begins. Listed below are some of the formal procedures used to ensure the safe storage of ammonia and chlorine:\r\n\r\n1)  Equipment selection is a part of a formal review by licensed Professional Engineers. Independent companies performed ultrasonic tests and the Brunell Hardnes"

      "SummaryText": "s Test on the tank to certify the tank meets the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) ammonia storage tank requirements.\r\n\r\n2)  FCC staff performed a formal Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) before process startup. Any change to the equipment or any modification to the tank or piping requires the PHA to be repeated. One concern identified in this analysis was the possibility of the pressure relief valve venting. While the relief valve is a required piece of equipment, if vented and failed to reseat, the PHA analysis revealed the release could be significant. The PHA required the relief valve to be removed annually and inspected by an independent, certified inspector to insure the valve parts would be maintained and inspected regularly. In addition, since overfilling would cause the relief valve to activate, FCC installed an automatic high-level shut-off valve and alarm. Automatic shut-off valves were installed on each fill and discharge line.\r\n\r\n3)  Operating procedures are written and available to all Operators for safe handling and storage transfers. FCC has a formal Management of Change procedure detailing in writing changes associated with equipment, procedures, and personnel.\r\n\r\n4)  Each Operator must pass process-specific qualification before assignment to this area. Competency is determined by written and oral testing. After this initial testing, FCC has ongoing training for operating and safe analysis, as well as hazard response. Each shift has members on the Emergency Response Team, which receives additional emergency response training. \r\n\r\n5)  A formal preventative maintenance program is in place to monitor the integrity of the tank, lines, and pumps. FCC performs an ultrasonic testing of the tank every 5 years. The tank is emptied and internally inspected every 10 years. Operators visually inspect the tank, lines and pump several times a shift. The pumps are formally checked every week.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, FCC follows procedures in place to prevent th"

The scenarios described above are hypothetical and have never occurred at this location.\r\n\r\nIf a release should occur that would create an off-site hazard, FCC will immediately notify the Industrial Park industries and emergency responders in the community. The Fire and Police Departments will notify the community of the status of the release and the actions to take using public address systems. These actions will depend upon the direction of the wind, the amount of the material released, and the length of the release. These actions may include shelter-in-place or evacuation. Local radio and television stations will be notified and will assist in notifying the public of the proper actions to take.\r\n\r\nFirst Chemical Corporation has many written programs in place to prevent accidental releases of chemicals into the environment. Our Environmental Policy states:\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of First Chemical Corporation to provide employees with the training, tools, and equipment necessary to operate and maintain facilities in compliance with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, and promptly report to employees, customers and the public information on the health and environmental hazards of our products, processes and waste materials.\r\n\r\nOperators continuously walk through the plant observing for and reporting immediately all leaks, odors, spills, contractor work practices, and other dangerous situations. A Work Order and Hot Work procedure are utilized for maintenance and contractor activities. In addition, the Maintenance Department has written procedures specifying critical tests, calibration for instruments, and pump and tank inspections. Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) are performed for every process before construction begins, making sure that all factors of safe storage and handling of"

      "SummaryText": "the chemicals are considered and safety measures are incorporated into the unit. FCC updates PHAs every 5 years or more frequently if process piping or a tank is modified.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Team has designated members and emergency response equipment, conducts frequent training on response techniques, and regularly performs emergency response drills. The Emergency Response Team is made up of employees from each shift. The Emergency Responders are trained in all hazard response and safety procedures and receive formal training in emergency response. The written Emergency Response Plan establishes responsible personnel and contains emergency telephone numbers and notification requirements. FCC will respond immediately and systematically to any spill or release emergency.\r\n\r\nFirst Chemical Corporation and its employees are committed to storing and producing chemicals in a manner that will protect the environment and the health of the community. Most FCC employees live in the area and want a safe environment for themselves and their families. Through the parent company, Chemours, FCC is an active member of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and its Responsible Care(r) Program. FCC is continuously striving to reduce the risk of its operations to the community. A principle of Responsible Care(r) is continuous improvement in the responsible care of chemicals and that includes reducing the potential for a worst-case scenario or any other accidental chemical release.\r\n\r\nThe elements of EPA Risk Management regulations (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA Process Safety Management Regulations (29 CFR Part 1910.119) have been integrated into one program to safely manage risks and protect both the workers and the community.\r\n\r\nThe owner or operator of the facility has designated a qualified person that has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements."
