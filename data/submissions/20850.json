      "SummaryText": "The Town of North Wilkesboro owns and operates a 2 MGD wastewater treatment plant (NPDES # NC0020761). The plant is located in the southeast part of Town and discharges into the Yadkin River. Chlorine delivered  and stored in ton containers is the primary chemical for disinfection to meet fecal coliform effluent limitations. Sodium bisulfite is used for dechlorination. No more than three (3) ton containers of chlorine are onsite at once.\n\nThe Town is soliciting equipment proposals for ultraviolet disinfection (UV) equipment to replace the chlorine and sodium bisulfite storage and feed systems. The Town staff anticipates converting to a UV system for primary disinfection following the equipment testing, procurement, and installation phases.  Equipment purchase and installation is planned for fiscal year (FY) 2001.\n\nAfter  the UV equipment is on-line and the chlorination system is decommissioned the wastewater treatment plant will go from  a Program 3  to a Program 1. The North Wilkesboro wastewater treatment plant RMP would be de-registered at that time."
