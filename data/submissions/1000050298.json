      "SummaryText": "Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nTampa Electric Company (TECO) is an investor-owned electric utility which serves an area of about 2,000 square miles in West-Central Florida, including Hillsborough County and portions of Polk, Pasco, and Pinellas Counties.  In addition to several other generating facilities, TECO owns and operates the H.L. Culbreth Bayside Power Station (BPS) located on Port Sutton Road, in Hillsborough County, Florida.  \r\nBPS is a natural-gas fired power station consisting of two-combined cycle units.  Unit 1 consists of three General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, three Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HSRG) and one repowered steam generator.  Unit 2 consists of four General Electric Model PG7241(FA) combustion turbines, four HSRGs, and one repowered steam turbine generator.  The BPS natural gas fired combined cycle turbines use dry low-NOX (DLN) technology to reduce NOX emissions.  The HRSGs have a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system installed to further reduce NOx emissions. The SCR is designed to reduce NOx emissions by reacting ammonia with NOx in the flue gas to yield nitrogen and water vapor in the presence of a catalyst.  The SCR process contains more than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia for RMP.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\nBPS is committed to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community.  The facility also exceeds the anhydrous ammonia threshold quantity for the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)  Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  A PSM program has been implemented which serves as the RMP Prevention Program.  The program includes provisions for the management of the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including evaluations of process design and changes, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, emergency plans and procedures, training, and other elements which impact the operational safety proces"

      "SummaryText": "s.  Procedures are complemented by personal training, drills and facility inspections.  \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nThe BPS facility has had no accidental releases of ammonia that have resulted in an offsite consequence in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nThe facility has written emergency response procedures in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38 and paragraph (q) of 29 CFR  1910.120.  The plan has been coordinated with the local emergency response organization, Hillsborough Fire and Rescue Department.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911 and by notifying the Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nPlans to improve safety include revalidating the current PHA and providing refresher training on Operating Procedures."
