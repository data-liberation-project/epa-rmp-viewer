(Jayhawk operates a batch specialty chemical manufacturing facility near Galena, Kansas.  The industrial area within which Jayhawk property and manufacturing operations are located is known locally as the Jayhawk Plant, dating back to its creation in the 1940s. That portion of the Jayhawk Plant Site containing Jayhawk property, buildings and equipment will be referred to hereinafter as the \"Facility\". \n\n    The Facility is located on approximately 850 acres of a 2,200-acre industrial     complex. Jayhawk's Unit 1 encompasses approximately 29 acres and Unit 2     encompasses approximately 25 acres. The Facility is located approximately 3.5 miles north of the junction of Kansas Route 66 and U.S. Highway 400 at     Riverton, Kansas. \n\n\n\n    The regulated substances handled at Jayhawk include:\n\n1.

While the RMP rule originally required that the Executive Summary briefly describe the OCA for worst-case and alternative release scenario(s), EPA amended the RMP rule in 2004 to remove this requirement because of security concerns.

It is used as a primary raw material in the production of one of the finished products in Unit 1. Acetaldehyde stored in the quantity indicated requires that the system comply with RMP Program Level III regulations. According to US EPA's RMP*Comp A&reg;  (RMPComp), that quantity of acetaldehyde results in a 0.3-mile radius to the one pound per square inch (p.s.i.) overpressure endpoint.

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 1 residential persons located within the radius of the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nA worse case scenario for anhydrous ammonia is the catastrophic failure of the storage tank.  Since the tank contains 96,000 pounds when full, the scenario involves the release of 96,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia through 3-inch hole.  Anhydrous ammonia stored in the quantity indicated requires that the system comply with RMP Program Level III regulations. According to RMPComp, that quantity of anhydrous ammonia results in a 3.6-mile radius to the 0.14 mg/L toxicity endpoint.

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 0 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\n\n\n\nTrimethylchlorosilane\n\nA more likely scenario for trimethylchlorosilane is the failure of a hose (leak) during process operations.  Therefore, the alternative scenario involves the release of 1000 pounds of trimethylchlorosilane through a 1-inch rupture. The following is the RMPComp modeling results for the alternative scenario:\n\nCategory:     Toxic Liquid\n\nQuantity Released:     1000 pounds\n\nRelease Duration:     12 minutes\n\nStorage Parameters:     Isocontainer under pressure\n\nHole or puncture area:     3.1 square inches\n\nRelease Rate: 82.8 pounds per min\n\nLiquid Temperature:    100 F\n\nMitigation Measures:     None\n\nRelease Rate to Outside Air:    1.73 pounds per minute\n\nEvaporation Time:    404 min\n\nTopography:     Urban surroundings (many obstacles in the immediate area)\n\nToxic Endpoint:     0.028 mg/L; basis: EHS-LOC; LOC is based on IDLH-equivalent\n\nlevel estimated from toxicity data.\n\nEstimated Distance to Toxic Endpoint:     2.2 miles\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis indicates th"

The demographic data indicates that there are approximately 442 persons located within the radius of the alternative case scenario.\n\n\n\nTetramethylsilane\n\nJayhawk facility  contains 42,000 pounds of tetramethylsilane. Tetramethylsilane stored in an isocontainer is produced as  one of the finished products in Unit 2.  According to RMPComp, the quantity of tetramethylsilane indicated alternate case results in a 0.1-mile radius to the lower flammability endpoint.

This detailed analysis guides the site in determining specific prevention measures to preclude accidents.\n\n\n\n(d)    Jayhawk operates a modern facility with state of the art safety policies, practices and systems. There have been no off-site consequences involving regulated processes, or regulated chemicals, at the facility. There is no five-year accident history involving either regulated processes or chemicals that involve personnel injury, death or significant property damage.\n\n\n\n(e)    The facility has an Emergency Response Plan intended to protect human health and the environment. There is a procedure for the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public. Training is provided to all employees on"

      "SummaryText": " the Emergency Response Plan and the emergency equipment available at the facility. This Emergency Response Plan is updated as often as necessary, but not less than once every three years.  Emergency response is provided by the Galena, KS Fire Department with mutual aid assistance agreements with Columbus, and Baxter Springs, KS Fire Departments. Columbus is located approximately 10 miles northwest of the facility, and Baxter Springs is located approximately 10 miles southwest of the facility. There is a Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for Cherokee County, KS. Mutual aid response times are approximately 30 minutes from the initiation of the notice. There is a Jayhawk staffed Emergency Response Team which has training in incipient stage fire response. Additional support is provided through coordination of the emergency with outside agencies through use of the plant telephone and emergency notification system.\n\n\n\n(f)    Apart from compliance with specific guidelines, the policy of Evonik Jayhawk Fine Chemicals is also aligned to continuous development, especially in terms of plant and occupational safety, environmental protection, protecting the health of its employees, product safety, transportation safety and site security.  Specifically, EJFC operates with a policy of investigating near misses and incidents and includes findings into updates of our safety management policies and procedures.  Communication to plant personnel is routinely held to inform and train employees on improvements learned from the incident reporting management system.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nEvonik Jayhawk is engaged in a new corporate safety improvement program \"Safety at Evonik 2016\" focusing on human behavior and safety culture.  All Evonik employees from top to bottom will be trained and required to implement in an effort to reduce incidents.\n\nAdditionally, EJFC is installing a new DCS (distributed control system)in Plant C to improve control of operating processes."
