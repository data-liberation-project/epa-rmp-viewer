      "SummaryText": "     The Taylor County Public Service District (PSD) operates a 2 MGD Water Treatment Plant (WTP) that uses 1-ton chlorine containers for drinking water disinfection purposes. The maximum chlorine storage at any one time is 4,000 pounds. The WTP was rebuilt in 1985 and has never had a chlorine release.\n     A complete RMProgram was developed and a written RMPlan with the 14 recommended sections for Prevention Program 3 was completed as outlined by the AWWA \"RMP Guidance for Water Treatment Plants\" document.\n     All WTP operators participated in the RMPlan development and attended associated training sessions. Training included the topics of chemical hazard awareness, chemical safety, process hazard analysis, use of personal protective equipment in emergency response, emergency chlorine release shut-down procedures, and general emergency response conditions.\n     A Taylor County Local Emergency Planning Committee meeting was attended and the elements of the RMPlan were presented with the emphasis on the emergency response procedures. Discussions were held on response and assistance needs from the Taylor County 911 Center, Grafton Fire Department, and law enforcement agencies for notification and evacuation, if a major chlorine release should ever occur."
