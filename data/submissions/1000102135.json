      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\nThe PMC Organometallix, Inc. facility, which is co-located within the Arkema, Inc. facility, has implemented the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Plan (RMP or Plan) program to document steps taken to reduce accidential releases of hazardous materials.  The RMP summarized the management, administrative, procedural and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the community.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including the following:\n- Introduction\n- Policies to protect health, environment and safety\n- Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes\n- Prevention program\n- Five-year accident history, and \n- Emergency response plan\n\nPolicies on Health, Environment and Safety:\nRisk management and safety are important concerns to both PMC and Arkema.  Both companies are committed to conducting its operations in a safe, responsible manner while reducing risks to human health and the environment.  The Arkema and PMC Plant Managers and their safety committees regularly review safety performance, take corrective actions, and strive for continuous improvement to safety.  HES programs include policies, procedures, standards and guidance materials designed to fulfill commitments to health, environment and safety.  These materials include RMP guidance that helps the facility prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidental releases.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances in Covered Processes:\nThe PMC Organometallix, Inc. Mobile facility is located on Highway 43, approximately 7 miles north of Exit 19 on Interstate 65.  The facility manufactures intermediate chemicals which are sold to customers including another PMC Organometallix facility that manufactures PVC stabilizers and glass coatings.  Chlorine is used in the PMC Organometallix portion of the site above the RMP threshold quantity, and thus is regu"

      "SummaryText": "lated under RMP (40 CFR 68).  The PMC facility is also subject to 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management regulations.  Chlorine is handled at the facility with a great deal of care and respect.\n\nPrevention Program:\nReleases are prevented by designing for safety, maintaining for safe operation, monitoring for safe operations, and by auditing for safety.  Arkema and PMC conduct process hazard analyses to identify potential release scenarios and assess safeguards for design changes.  The facility also maximizes employee participation in design work, designs process components with multiple computer-controlled and local-controlled automatic safety shutdown and building emergency shutoff systems throughout the plant.  Arkema provides emergency response support to the PMC facility.  Fire fighting equipment is strategically located throughout the Arkema facility.  Easily identified emergency escape routes from the units are maintained.  \n\nThis facility maintains safe operation through a preventative maintenance program for process equipment, executed by Arkema, Inc.  The preventative maintenance program includes routine mechanical integrity inspections over the life of the equipment, the routine testing of emergency shutdown devices and safety systems, the checking of sensors, and the use of mandatory checklists to ensure equipment is opened for repair without creating releases.\n\nThe facility operates 19 chemical gas sensors, which detect leaks at low levels.  Sensors sound alarms to warn workers.  Many sensor systems are designed to automatically shut down the process area in a safe state.  The process has emergency shutoff valves that can be controlled from several locations.\n\nThe facility operates with trained, knowledgeable, process safety certified operators (employees of Arkema, Inc).  The operators are trained through the use of detailed operating procedures.  Many operations are computer controlled and monitored.  Additionally, video cameras are used to watch k"

      "SummaryText": "ey areas and high pressure, temperature, and level alarms are used whenever required.  \n\nThe facility audits its safety programs frequently.  In-plant and Arkema corporate personnel conduct process safety audits.  Plant and Arkema personnel regularly conduct operations and safety inspections.  The site investigates incidents and near misses, finds root causes, and develops and implements corrective actions to prevent recurrence.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\nThere have been no RMP releases in the last five years (i.e. no on-site, off-site injuries, property damage or environmental damage, or off-site evacuations resulting from a chemical release).\n\nEmergency Response Plan:\nEmergency Response is coordinated through the Arkema facility in which PMC is co-located.  The written emergency response plan incorporates RMP release scenarios.  The facility actively works with the Mobile Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to coordinate emergency response training and drills at the plant site.  Selected elements of the plan are incorporated into the Mobile County Emergency Action Plan, which is maintained by the LEPCC.  The facility also works with the other members of the LeMoyne Industrial Park (LIP), and maintains an incident command protocol for emergency preparedness.  PMC (through Arkema) is prepared to respond to accidental releases.  Arkema/PMC employees participate in emergency response drills, attend annual fire training and professional fire schools, maintain fire/spill response equipment, staff an on-site 24 hours per day emergency response team, train contractors on plant prevention systems and process information, and train employees to respond to medical/first responder matters.  Supervisors and key personnel also receive additional incident command and spill response training."
