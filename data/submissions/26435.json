This facility is known as the Kenton Plant and is located on State Route 68 South.  The facility consists of two units.  One manufactures phenolic resins and one manufactures molding compounds.  The facility also conducts warehousing and shipping operations to support manufacturing.  The facility was originally constructed in 1954 and employs approximately 115 full-time employees.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source ( 68.155(a)):\n\nDurez is committed to operating the Kenton facility in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best management practices.  As part of this commitment Durez has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Kenton facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA?s) regulation 40CFRpart 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule.  This also provides the public with a description of the risk management program at the Kenton facility.  \n\nThe RMP at the Kenton facility consists of the following three elements:\n\n A hazard assessment program to help understand: (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances r"

The hazard assessment program includes Process Hazard Reviews (PHRs), PreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSRs) and Management of Change (MOCs).\n\n- A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes). The prevention programs includes our\nMechanical Integrity (MI), hot works, operating procedures, incident investigation and training (including contractors).\n- An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of substances including materials from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the Kenton facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in an environmentally sound and safe manner, it is only one component of the environmental program at the Kenton facility.  In fact, the Kenton facility has a comprehensive environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance, as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nDurez limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at the Kenton facility, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Kenton facility, Durez reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment.  Steps are taken to prevent any such effects through the facility?s Chemical Pre-approval, MOC and PHR procedures, which are followed for all new process or modifications of existing processes.\n \nDurez strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  Durez                  implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of  hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the Kenton "

Industry and government standards are closely  \nadhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Durez also uses the Corporate Fire, Safety and Environment (F S&E) Guidelines  when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed in an MOC or PSSR (for all changes or new systems) before approval. These reviews include EHS, engineering, operations, maintenance and management personnel.  In addition, Durez requires the documentation  of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees (including call-ins) with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Mechanical Integrity program provides an ongoing process to verify  the mechanical integrity of the equipment piping , and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\nDurez goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release.  In the event of an accidental release, the Kenton facility controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent impact to the public and the environment. Durez utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Durez trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  The facility also maintains an active Emergency Response Team which is on call 24 hours a day to respond to an accidental release.  Durez  has established  a Special Situations Center in the Dallas corporate office to assist in emergencies.  In addition, Durez works with the Kenton City Fire Dept., 911 Review Board, BKP Ambulance Service, Kenton City Police Dept., and the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.

This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency. If the emergency extends beyond the facility boundaries and affects the surrounding community, the Hardin County  Emergency Response Plan is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency.\n\nDurez is an active participant in the community. Durez is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote education, safety and environmental awareness.  We support activities of Keep Hardin County Beautiful, Household Hazardous Waste Collection, Arbor  Day, Wildlife  Federation and Earth Day.  This is conducted by employees volunteering, cash donations and presentation to the community. \n\nDurez is an industry leader in the implementation of the Chemical Manufacturer?s Association sponsored  Responsible Care Initiative.  As part of Durezs? Responsible Care efforts the Kenton facility has voluntarily  established a Community Advisory Panel (CAP). The purpose of this group is to share information about plant operations with members of the community and to discuss community concerns.  The group meets periodically and covers topics of interest to the members, including plant safety and environmental performance, emergency response programs, TRI reporting, process safety performance and RMP.  Through this outreach effort, as well as other community involvement, the plant stays abreast of community concerns and works to address them.\n\nOver the past five years, the Kenton facility has received the following Durez environmental and safety awards:\n- Durez Corporate Environmental Merit ? 1996 through 1998\n- Bronze award for one year without a recordable safety incident ? 1997\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the Kenton facility helps provide assurance that the facili"

In order to implement these policies effectively, Durez established a management system headed by the Health, Environmental and Safety (HES) Department to oversee safety and environmental-related activities.  This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the environmental and safety programs at the Kenton facility that are required by the RMP rule.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled ( 68.155(b))\n\nThe Kenton facility handles only one regulated substance that is covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\nRegulated Substance: Formalin (45% aqueous solin.) Process: Storage Tanks Quantity, lb.:840,000 solution\nRMP Threshold, lb.*: 10,000.\n\n*Threshold quantity is the quantity of ?pure? chemical, not the solution\n\nFormalin is one of the major raw materials used at this facility.  It is a solution of formaldehyde dissolved in water.  No pressurized formaldehyde gas or liquefied  formaldehyde is used on site. Formalin is stored in a 100,000 gallon aboveground storage tank with a re-circulating distribution system to five reactors in two  operating units.   The finished material from the reactors only contain residual concentrations of formaldehyde, therefore, the storage tank, the re-circulation loop and the reactors are the only RMP covered processes on-site.  The facility complies with the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations in the loading, unloading, and shipment of materials. \n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe Kenton facility performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance to affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a ?worst-case release scenario? and an ?alternative release scenario.?  In reality, however, Durez does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur.  A catastrophic event, such as earthquake or airplane crashing into the storage tank and no emergency response action would be required for this scenario to occur.  The worst-case and alternative-case release scenario was developed to help Durez and local ER groups improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nTrinity Consultants were hired to model the scenarios for a formalin release, including the distance to the release endpoint (ERPG-2).  The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case scenario and typical values in Kenton for the alternative release scenario.  The EPA recommended Landview program be utilized to estimate the number of people living within the distance from the location of the storage tank.  USGS and City school district maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within the distance.\n\nThe following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed for the Kenton facility:\n\n3.1 Toxic Substances ? Formalin\n\nThe ?worst-case release scenario? modeled for formalin is the total failure of the Formalin Storage Tank, which would release 840,000 pounds of 45% formaldehyde solution instantaneously, as mandated by EPA. The reaction rate of formaldehyde to form solid paraformaldehyde and the evaporation  rate were calculated by Trinity Consultants.  Under the EPA default worst weather conditions, the formaldehyde would travel approximately 0.78 miles before the concentration of formaldehyde was reduced to below 1 ppm (which is the ?endpoint?  established in the RMP rule"

      "SummaryText": ").  The U.S. Census indicates that 112 people live within this distance from the storage tank;  The Hardin County Airport, residences, commercial facilities and one industrial facility are the only public receptor located within this distance.  No sensitive environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\nThe ?alternative case release scenario? is the failure to transfer hose while unloading a tanker truck into the storage tank, releasing approximately 500 lbs of formalin liquid in a 2-minute period.  Trinity Consultants also modeled  this alternative release scenarios to determine the off-site consequences which showed that the formaldehyde would not leave the site before the formaldehyde concentration is below 1 ppm ( which is the ?endpoint? value established in the RMP rule).  No people live within the distance from the tanker truck unloading area; no public receptors or environmental receptors are located within this distance.\n\n3.2  Program 3 Processes-Flammable Substances\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances in quantities above the threshold quantities at the plant.  Propane is stored on-site in 30 lb cylinders, however, the total quantity is less than the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (68.155(d)):\n\nSince 1994, the Kenton facility has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1994, the facility revised this prevention program to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements.  Of  these, the Kenton facility falls under ?Program 3?.\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the plant?s fenceline;\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Kenton facility?s Progr"
