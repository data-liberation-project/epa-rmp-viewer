Anhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration system in the cold storage facility. This RMP is concerned with the cold storage facility.\r\n\r\nThe cold storage system is a flood-type system and consists of a mechanical room with four compressors, high pressure receiver, evaporative condenser and product cooling coils.\r\n\r\nThe cold storage room system contains approximately 15,200 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The threshold planning quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 500 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis system will be operated by trained plant personnel and maintained regularly by licensed and trained contractors.\r\n\r\nThe Fresh Innovations facility is a non-responding facility and has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe Fresh Innovations facility refrigeration system is a flooded / recirculated type system utilizing the vapor compression refrigeration cycle, charged with 15,200lbs of Ammonia (anhydrous).\r\n\r\nThe system is comprised of four compressors, one high pressure receiver, two evaporative condensers, one suction accumulator, one recirculated pump package, fifteen surge drums, product cooling units and shell and tube heat exchangers and falling film heat exchangers, inter connecting piping, valves for isolation and control of the equipment and associated controls for all equipment.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is Ammonia (anhydrous) CAS # 7664-41-7, a colorless gas liquified under pressure with a strong, pungent odor.\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\nFresh Innovations, in an effort to ensure t"

The management system installed at Fresh Innovations revolves around daily inspections and annual review of all components of the ammonia system.  All releases and near misses will be reviewed with the focus of making the system better.  The management system controls all activities in inspections and logging the activity in the operations binder.  At this time only employees from Refrigerated Mechanical Solutions are authorized to make repairs on the ammonia system.  \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\nThe Fresh Innovations facility has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage onsite , or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage since assuming operational responsibility of the system on 6/1/2018. \r\n\r\nPrior to this date there are no known accidental releases at the facility for the previous 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nFresh Innovations has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Fresh Innovations employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders."
