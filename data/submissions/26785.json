Engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records were utilized to determine alternative release scenarios that could potentially result in off-site impacts.  Each scenario was evaluated and the scenario most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts was selected for modeling. \r\n\r\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.  According to EPA guidance, default dispersion conditions are neutral atmosphere (D stability) and a 3 m/sec wind speed.  These conditions can occur when the sky is overcast or during the morning or evening hours. A review of climatological data for Chicago, Illinois (O'Hare Airport), confirmed that conditions of D stability and wind speeds of 3 m/sec and greater are typical of the area, and therefore are suitable for the evaluation of alternative releases. Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and for both active and passive mitigation.  Alternative release dispersion modeling was also conducted using RMP*CompTM.  \r\n\r\nThe alternative propylene oxide release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break along the pipe from the storage area to the reactor area.  A break of this type would result in the release of propylene oxide from the pipe at a release rate conservatively estimated to be 620 lbs/min.  Cargill has estimated that it would take plant personnel approximately 30 minutes to respond and shut down the flow, resulting in a total release of 18,600 lbs. RMP*CompTM indicates that under urban conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would be 0.2 mile.  The toxic endpoint for propylene"

The raw materials and process chemicals utilized by the plant are delivered via truck and rail from external sources.  Access to the site by vendors, employees, and visitors is controlled by fencing and security checkpoints.  One of the chemicals utilized in the wet corn milling process at the Hammond facility  is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, propylene oxide (PO).  The starch modification and cyclodextrin process areas each use PO. These areas contain the only processes at the facility that are subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes, denoted as Program 1, 2 and 3. Program 1, which has minimal requirements, applies to facilities for which a worst-case release would not affect off-site receptors.  Program 3 applies to facilities with NAICS codes listed in the regulation or that are subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard (PSM).  Program 2 applies to all other facilities.  Cargill has elected to comply with Program 3, the program with the most rigorous RMP requirements.  The Program 3 accident prevention program encompasses the requirements of PSM.  Program 3 related information for the starch modification and cyclodextrin production areas is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nPropylene oxide is delivered by railcar to a 29,835-gallon capacity storage tank located in the starch area.

In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses.  For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-cases defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Cargill to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented. The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case and alternative cases are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \r\n\r\n3.1 Worst-Case Release for Propylene Oxide\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  If not contained by a dike or berm, toxic liquids like PO are assumed to spill instantaneously and spread to a depth of 1 cm. The duration of the release is based on the evaporation rate of the toxi"

The following is a summary of the elements of the accidental release prevention program in place at the Hammond facility.  Hot work permits, and emergency planning and response (see section 6.0) are also included in the prevention program, but are not specifically summarized below.  Furthermore, within each chemical system, there are safety features designed specifically for the process and chemical.   Examples of such process specific controls include: isolation valves, curbing and diking to contain releases, continuous process area monitoring, pressure relief devices, condensers and scrubbers for emission control, fire extinguishing systems, personal protective equipment, and trained emergency response personnel.\r\n\r\n4.1 Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Hammond facility maintains technical documents that are used to assist in our accident prevention efforts.  This written safety information includes chemical properties, process descriptions and diagrams, equipment design information, and operational parameters.\r\n\r\n4.2 Process Hazard Analysis  \r\n\t\r\nThe Hammond facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled effectively.  We primarily use the Hazard and Operability (Hazop) analysis technique to carry out these studies.  The Hazop analysis is considered one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.

The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic endpoints, is considered the worst-case release for each facility.  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation of the worst case release.\r\n\r\nEPA has established toxic endpoints for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level 2 (ERPG-2), which protects individuals from health-threatening or escape-impairing injury.  The ERPG-2 is defined as:\r\n\r\nthe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Off-site Consequence (EPA 550-B-99-009) identifies modeling methods to estimate the spill rate, emission rate and resultant distance to toxic and flammable endpoints for worst-case and alternative releases.  EPA has developed a computer program RMP*CompTM that follows this guidance. RMP*CompTM was used in this assessment.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion and influences the distance to toxic endpoint.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed. Within and in the immediate vicinity of the Cargill Hammond facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is 'urban' in nature.  \r\n\r\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 68, the worst-case modeling is conducte"

Analysis of five years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Chicago, Illinois (O'Hare Airport) indicates that this combination of wind speed and stability occurs approximately 3% of the time (about 1 hour per day, on average). The most predominant directions of transport are to the northeast. \r\n\r\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Hammond facility consists of an instantaneous release of 207,000 pounds of propylene oxide from the storage tank and subsequent evaporation from the diked area, dispersed during worst-case atmospheric conditions of stability class F and 1.5 m/s wind speed. In accordance with the off-site consequence analysis guidance, the temperature of the substance and the air are assumed to be 77o F. RMP*CompTM results indicated that the PO release would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.5 miles. The worst-case endpoint distance encompasses a resident population of approximately 720 persons, estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program. The potential worst-case hazard zone includes residences, recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas.

The incident information is reviewed and a determination is made as to whether a reportable quantity on any chemical listed as requiring reports to regulatory authorities is involved.  If so, the appropriate authorities are notified.\r\n\r\nDuring the past 5 years there has been no accident involving propylene oxide that qualifies for reporting under 40 CFR Part 68.  This means that during this period, no release of a substance presently regulated under RMP has resulted in reportable on-site or off-site injury, off-site evacuation or shelter-in-place, significant on-site property damage, or off-site damage to property or the environment.  \r\n\r\n6 .0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\n\r\nCargill's Hammond plant has established an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to ensure appropriate steps are taken to protect the public health and the environment, as well as the safety of the plant employees."
