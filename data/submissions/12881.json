At a minimum, the mill and equipment meet government and industry design and construction standards.\n\nMuskegon\u0012s commitment to environmental stewardship and providing a safe workplace is illustrated by the fact that it maintains and implements a single, easy to use Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP).  The ICP is designed to provide more-effective emergency response guidance and to comply with a number of state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning laws.  \n \nB.  RMP Covered Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nAs of June 21, 1999, the Muskegon mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and fine coated papers.  The only chemicals present at the mill in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the RMP rule are chlorine and chlorine dioxide.  Chlorine and chlorine dioxide are used in the bleaching process and chlorine is used in the water treatment process (collectively referred to as covered processes).  Chlorine is stored in 90-ton rail cars for the pulp bleaching process.  Chlorine is stored in 2000 lb. cylinders in the water treatment process.  Chlorine dioxide comprises approximately 1% of a liquid mixture that is stored in two 15,000 gallon tanks that are surrounded by dikes. \n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine in a covered process is 360,000 lbs.  The maximum amount of chlorine in a single rail car is 180,000 pounds. The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide in a covered process is 2500 pounds.  The maximum amount of chlorine dioxide in a single vessel is 1,250 pounds.\n\nC.

Muskegon  has developed and implements written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely operating the covered processes.  These procedures are consistent with the process safety information described earlier and include:\n\nA.Initial startup;\nB. Normal operations;\nC.Temporary operations;\nD. Emergency shutdown including the conditions under which emergency shutdown is required, and the assignment of shutdown responsibility to qualified operators to ensure that emergency shutdown is executed in a safe and timely manner;\nE.

Muskegon confirms that employees and contractors involved in operating covered processes have successfully completed the required periodic training.  Muskegon documents that covered employees and contractors have received and \n understood the required training.  Documentation, at a minimum, includes the identity of\n the employee or contract employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that \nthe employee understood the training.\n\n6.

As part of its overall fire protection program, Muskegon  implements a hot work permit program for all hot work operations (e.g., welding, soldering, etc.) conducted on or near covered processes.\n\n10. Management of Change.  Muskegon has established and implements a procedure to authorize and document changes in covered processes.  This procedure ensures that all required considerations are addressed prior to any change being implemented.  \n\n11. Incident Investigation.  Muskegon  investigates each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a significant release of a highly hazardous chemical in the workplace.  An incident investigation team is established and consists of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. \n\n12. Emergency Planning and Response.  Muskegon has developed an integrated contingency plan that satisfies all applicable state and federal emergency response and accidental prevention planning requirements (described under emergency response policies below). \n\n13. Compliance Audits.  Muskegon has evaluated its compliance with OSHA\u0012s PSM Standard at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices it has developed are adequate and being followed.

Emergency Response Procedures and Policies\n\nMuskegon maintains a fully trained emergency response team (ERT) that is on-site 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.  These teams are capable of minimizing the adverse impact from reasonably foreseeable accidental releases that may occur. \n\nIn the unlikely event that an accidental release occurs that is beyond the capabilities of Muskegon\u0012s Hazardous Material Response Team and Fire Brigade, the mill has entered into informal mutual aid agreements with the Muskegon Fire and Police Departments, Mercy Hospital, Muskegon General Hospital, North Ottawa Hospital (Grand haven), and several private response providers.  These entities are available to respond to emergencies at the Muskegon mill upon request by Muskegon.  The Muskegon Fire Department operates under a mutual aid agreement with the Fire Departments of Norton Shores, Muskegon Heights, and Muskegon Township to ensure that additional emergency response personnel and equipment are available to respond to a significant release at the mill.\n\nMuskegon has also adopted and implements an Integrated Contingency Plan that meets the regulatory requirements of the following federal and state response planning and prevention laws:  \n\n7 OSHA Emergency Response Plan (29 C.F.R. 1910.120(q));\n7 OSHA Process Safety Management emergency response requirements (29 C.F.R.

Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nMuskegon  has developed an accidental release prevention program that is designed and implemented to drastically reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the requirements of OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management rule found at 29 C.F.R. Part 1910.119 and analogous RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  To comply with the RMP rule, the mill has taken its existing PSM program and incorporated an additional focus\u0017protection of the public.  \n\nThe basic elements of  Muskegon\u0012s prevention program are described below: \n\n1. Employee Participation.  Muskegon  has developed and implements a written plan of action regarding employee participation in the safety and accident prevention process.  The plan describes how employees are:  (A)  consulted and what input they will have in the development of Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) and other PSM and RMP safety elements; and (B) given access to PSM and RMP information at the mill.   \n\n2. Process Safety Information.  In accordance with applicable requirements, Muskegon  has compiled and maintains  process safety information about the design, installation, maintenance, and operations of its covered processes.  This ensures that information remains current. \n\n3. Process Hazard Analyses.  Muskegon  performed process hazard analyses (PHA) on its PSM/RMP covered processes.  The PHA is a key component of the  process safety management system and Muskegon\u0012s  RMP accident prevention program.  It is a thorough, orderly, systematic approach for identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential hazards posed by the covered processes. \n\nSpecifically, the PHA addressed: (1) hazards of the process; (2) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards and their interrelationsh"

      "SummaryText": "munity.  As required by RMP, Muskegon\u0012s off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to be based on the hottest day of the year, occurring at night with a very slow, steady wind which would not disperse a release very effectively. Further, the model assumes that the entire contents of the largest vessel is released instantaneously.  According to the chlorine institute, no 90-ton rail car has ever instantaneously released its contents, and the chances of such an event occurring on Lake Michigan on a 980F night when the wind is blowing at 3.4 miles per hour is extremely remote.  \n\nUnder the EPA mandated scenario described above, the worst-case release at the mill (for purposes of RMP) would result in a vapor cloud that could extend beyond the mill\u0012s property line.\n\nMuskegon developed alternative scenarios for chlorine and chlorine dioxide which focus on more realistic release scenarios occurring during more common meteorological conditions.  However, EPA requires modeling of a release which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule, the process hazard analyses (PHAs) performed on covered processes, and all past releases from covered processes,  Muskegon chose the following three alternative release scenarios:  \n\n1. A gasket failure in the chlorine liquid line from the 90-ton rail car to the vaporizer building;\n2. The failure of a valve whip; and \n3. The insufficient supply o"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nS.D. Warren Company is committed to operating its integrated pulp and paper mill in Muskegon, Michigan in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and employee safety, Muskegon has developed and implements numerous environmental and safety programs that are designed to eliminate and/or drastically reduce the potential for accidental releases.  S.D. Warren  has also developed and implements a number of programs that are designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs, it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to people, the environment and the mill.  Many of these programs have been in place since the late 1980\u0012s. \n\nS.D. Warren believes that safety, health and environmental protection are essential to responsibly operating its facilities.  S.D. Warren views accident prevention, and personnel and environmental protection as a continuous  process.  Consequently, S.D. Warren continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs.  A recent addition to S.D. Warren\u0012s overall accident prevention and response program is the development of the Muskegon mill\u0012s Risk Management Program.  Muskegon\u0012s risk management program complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA\u0012s) Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  One of the requirements of this rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA.  This document satisfies the requirement by providing the public with information about  processes, accident prevention programs and emergency response planning efforts at the Muskegon mill.  Muskegon\u0012s compliance with EPA\u0012s RMP rule includes:"
