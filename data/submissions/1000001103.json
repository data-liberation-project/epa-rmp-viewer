In addition, the Excel Paralubes site has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Excel Paralubes site is coordinated with the Lake Charles, Louisiana Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Excel Paralubes site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Excel Paralubes site conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned:\r\n\r\n?\tRisk Based Inspection (RBI) and Criticality Studies\r\n?\tRetro Positive Material Identification (PMI) program\r\n?\tCorrosion Under Insulation (CUI) program\r\n?\tShort Term Fix Guidelin"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement effective controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site is located in Westlake, Louisiana.  It operates a variety of processes that takes vacuum gas oil (an intermediate product from the refining of raw crude oil) and produces petroleum products such as naptha, kerosene, diesel and lubricant base oils.  The Excel Paralubes site has regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, NFPA4 flammable mixtures, and hydrogen. The site also has several of the RMP listed toxic substances, but none at the quantity or concentration specified in the regulation. \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Excel Paral"

Because processes at the site are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the site and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the site has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site keeps a variety of technical documents called Process Technology Packages (PTP's).  PTP's are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nCh"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits (SOL) section of the PT Packages.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems). \r\n\r\nThe site also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site uses a combination of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique along with a What-If checklist to perform these evaluations.

The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Excel Paralubes site periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented, tracked, and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) process startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced oper"

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.

      "SummaryText": "at the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Excel Paralubes site periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and management personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Excel Paralubes site have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 2 and 3 EPA RMP-covered processes at the Excel Paralubes site.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failure and (2) human errors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the  Excel Paralubes site has safety features on many processes to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequence of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease detection:\r\n?\tHydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n?\tHydrogen Sulfide detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control:\r\n?\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n?\tScrubber to neutralize chemical releases\r\n?\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manually or automated)\r\n?\tAutomatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n?\tCurbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n?\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., interruptible powe"

We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving material covered under EPA's RMP rule since June, 1999.  This incident history considers on-site/off-site impacts such as injuries and fatalities, on-site/off-site property damage of $100,000 or more, off-site impact such as shelter-in-place or evacuation of the public and off-site environmental damage.  \r\n\r\nSummary:  From June 1999 through January 2006 we have had no significant accidental releases.  On February 1, 2006 we had one significant accidental release of NFPA 4 Flammable material.  This release resulted in over $100,000 of property damage.  There were no other on-site impacts.  Nor were there any off-site impacts or environmental damage.  This incident was thoroughly investigated and all corrective actions to address the root cause have been completed.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures"

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \r\nIn addition, the Excel Paralubes site maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Excel Paralubes site has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site uses contractors to supplement its workforce for maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and"

In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Excel Paralubes site incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and o"

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Excel Paralubes site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Site personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Excel Paralubes site has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) apply"
