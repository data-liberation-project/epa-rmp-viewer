The Almond Power Plant has a maximum amount of 4,300 pounds of chlorine.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is listed under CalARP regulations as a state regulated substance  with a threshold quantity of 500 pounds.  The Almond Power Plant has a maximum amount of 58,038 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nSafety Information\n\nAll safety information was reviewed in May of 1999.  This included a review of the process and required inspection and maintenance required by federal or state regulations or industry-specific design codes and standards.  \n \nHazard Review\n\nA hazard analysis was performed at the Almond Power Plant facility in 1997.  A review of this hazard analysis was compared with the requirements of CalARP regulations Section 2760.2(c) and found to cover the following required points:\n\n?    The hazards of the process;\n?    The identification of any previous incident which had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences;\n?    Engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards;\n?    Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls;\n?    Stationary source siting;\n?    Human factors;\n?    A qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls; and\n?    Consideration of external events, including seismic events.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures were reviewed in the compilation of this document and were found to be adequate for the needs of the Almond Power Plant.  Details of the operating procedures in existence at this facility can be found in Section III.3.c.\n\nTraining Programs\n\nExisting training programs were reviewed and found to be adequate.  Details of the training program used can be found in Section III.5.\n\n\n \nMaintenance Procedures\n\nMaintenance procedures were reviewed and found to be adequate.  Details of the maintenance procedures used at this facility can be found in Section III.3.e.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nA compliance audit will be performed at least every three years to verify that procedures and practices are adequate and being followed.  This compliance audit will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  On the following page is the form which will be used in performance of the compliance audit.\n\nA report of the findings will be developed.  Each of the report findings will be responded to and documented deficiencies will be addressed.  The two most recent compliance audits, reports and responses to the findings will be kept onsite.",

The Almond Power Plant utilizes a General Electric LM-6000 gas turbine engine serving a 49-MW electrical generator and heat recovery steam generator  (HRSG).  Ammonia and chlorine are used in parts of the power generation process.\n \nThe California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program merged the existing state Risk Management and Prevention Plan (RMPP) and the new federal Risk Management Plan (RMP) promulgated pursuant to Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  The California Office of Emergency Services (OES) oversees the CalARP regulations.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has delegated implementation authority for the federal program to OES.  At the local level, the program is implemented by the Certified Unified Permitting Agency (CUPA).  For facilities operating within the City of Ceres, the CUPA is Stanislaus County Environmental Resources, Hazardous Materials Division.\n\nBecause the CalARP program is a combination of the federal and state requirements, the program includes two lists of regulated toxic and flammable substances.  While many of the chemicals are present on both lists, the state applicability thresholds are generally lower.  The federal threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds and the state threshold limit is 100 pounds.  The federal threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia is 10,000 pounds and the state threshold quantity is 500 pounds.\nThe RMP must be developed from a comprehensive assessment of the processes, operations, and procedures at the facility, and includes four main elements:\n\n?A Management System that specifies qualified and responsible persons;\n?A Hazard Assessment that analyzes and documents potential environmental and population receptors due to an accidental release;\n?A Prevention Program that compiles operational procedures, safety information, and specific hazard infor"

The requirements of this section apply to any facility at which an extremely hazardous chemical is present at or above the threshold planning quantity.  The threshold planning quantity is the amount of a chemical above which the facility is required to notify the local emergency planning committee or emergency response personnel of the chemicals present, to provide a facility emergency response coordinator and to notify the committee of any changes that occur.\n\nAny facility that produces, uses or stores hazardous chemicals above the threshold planning quantity is required to notify specific agencies in the event of a release.   The reportable quantity is the amount of chemical released requiring notification of designated agencies.   Ammonia, a hazardous chemical located at the Almond Power Plant, has a threshold planning quantity of 500 pounds.  The reportable quantity for ammonia is 100 pounds.  Chorine, another hazardous chemical located at the plant, has a threshold planning quantity of 100 pounds.  The reportable quantity for chlorine is 10 pounds.\n\nAccording to RMP regulations, sulfuric acid is ?...listed as a regulated substance only under the following conditions:\n\na)If concentrated with greater than 100 pounds of sulfur trioxide or the acid meets the     definition of oleum.\nb)If in a container with flammable hydrocarbons (flash point <73F).?\n\nThe sulfuric acid used at this facility does not qualify as a regulated substance under these conditions.\n\nThe guidance document used as a format for this document is taken from the  Guidance Document for the California Consolidated Contingency Plan published by the Governor?s Office of Emergency Services and is modeled after the Natio"
