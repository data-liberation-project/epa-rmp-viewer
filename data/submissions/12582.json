              "Description": "Borden Chemicals and Plastics has eight different plants located at its Geismar, Louisiana site which meet the criteria for inclusion in EPA's RMP program.  In addressing the status of the prevention programs at the Geismar site, specific items are answered on either a global or plant-specific basis.  The following items are handled on a facility-wide basis and therefore have the same date for the requested date of the last revision:\n\n- most recent review or revision of maintenance procedures (7.7.a)\n- most recent review or revision of management of change procedures (7.8.b)\n- date of the most recent compliance audit (7.10.a)\n- expected or actual date of completion of all changes resulting from compliance audit (7.10.b)\n- most recent review or revision of employee participation plans (7.12) \n- most recent review or revision of hot work permit procedures (7.13)\n- most recent review or revision of contractor safety procedures (7.14)\n- most recent review or revision of contractor safety performance (7.15)\n\nThe remaining items are answered on a individual plant by plant basis.  \n\nThe ammonia plant is one of the eight plants at BCP's Geismar site which is covered by the RMP program.  For the ammonia plant, responses to data fields which request the \"last date\" on which a particular aspect has been addressed were answered as of June 10, 1999.",

As required by 40 CFR 68.155, BCP is including with the Risk Management Plan Submission the following Executive Summary.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBCP has a long-standing commitment to protection of the health and safety of its employees and the general public. It is BCP policy to provide the safest workplace possible for our employees while also minimizing to the fullest extent practical any impact on the neighboring community, which includes striving to eliminate accidental releases.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes; providing proper training to personnel; having up-to-date operating procedures; and implementing an effective maintenance and mechanical integrity program.  Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to minimize the potential for releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release in order to minimize to the fullest extent any possible impact on the neighboring community.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe BCP facility is located in Sections 3, 49, and 50 of Township 9 South, Range 2 East and Section 11 of Township 10 South, Range 2 East in Ascension Parish. The site is approximately 22 miles southeast of Baton Rouge, Louisiana at the intersection of Louisiana Highways 73 and 30 near the rural town of Geismar, LA.  The BCP facility has been in operation since 1961. The BCP complex has plants which produce acetylene, anhydrous ammonia, ethylene dichloride, formaldehyde, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, industrial gases (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), methan"

BCP also produces steam and electricity for internal consumption by cogeneration.  \n\nThe plant uses or produces the following RMP regulated substances in quantities above the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.130:\n\nToxics:        Ammonia, chlorine, formaldehyde and hydrogen chloride\nFlammables:      Hydrogen, propylene, vinyl chloride, and methane\n \n\nWorst-case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nNOTE:  BCP has numerous controls to minimize the potential for releases and to manage their consequences, however, as required by rule, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating worst-case scenarios for toxic or flammable substances.  \n\nToxic Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances at the plant is a catastrophic failure of the 130-ton chlorine storage vessel, resulting in a release of the entire contents over a ten-minute period.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligram per liter of chlorine for this WCS is 16.0 miles as determined by using EPA's RMPComp modeling program.  The potential population impact by such a release was determined to be 217,000 based on MAPInfo program using 1990 census blocks.  Due to the sizeable area potentially impacted, all of the noted public receptors are included (schools, residences, hospitals, prisons/correction facilities, recreation areas, and major commercial, office, and industrial areas). \n\nToxic Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nAs noted in the prior section, BCP has four chemicals that meet the criteria for inclusion in the RMP as toxics.  The chemicals are ammonia, chlorine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen chloride.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for ammonia is a two-hour release of ammonia through a leaking flange near the bottom of a large ammonia storage tank.

The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligram per liter of ammonia for this ARS is 0.2 miles as determined by RMPComp.  Though this scenario does reach off-site, there are no public receptors located within the modeled area of concern.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for chlorine is a 5-minute release through a pressure relief valve located on the chlorine storage tank.  The quantity released is assumed to be 875 pounds (or 175 pounds per minute release rate).  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 milligram per liter of chlorine for this ARS is 0.3 miles as determined by RMPComp.  While this scenario also reaches off-site, there are no public receptors located within the modeled area of concern.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for formaldehyde is a 2-minute release through a rupture disc failure on an outlet reactor bank header.  The quantity released is assumed to be 264 pounds (or 132 pounds per minute release rate).  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 milligram per liter of formaldehyde for this ARS is 0.6 miles as determined by RMPComp.  This scenario's area of concern does impact on one public receptor (major industrial area - a nearby petrochemical plant), but does not impact on any residences, schools, hospitals, or recreational areas.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for hydrogen chloride is a 5-minute release through a pressure relief valve located on a process vessel.  The quantity released is assumed to be 2700 pounds (or 540 pounds per minute release rate).  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.030 milligram per liter of hydrogen chloride for this ARS is 0.9 miles as determined by RMPComp.

Note that there are no schools, hospitals, prisons/correction facilities, or recreation areas within this area of concern. \n\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe flammable worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of two co-located vinyl chloride storage spheres.  Both spheres are considered because of their proximity to each other, and represent the largest quantity of Vinyl Chloride stored or involved in a process.  No administrative controls are considered in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, the full tank inventories of approximately 6,660,000 pounds is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 1.1 miles as determined by RMPComp. The potential population impact by such an event was determined to be 204 based on an enumeration of houses and dwellings within the 1.1-mile area of concern.  In addition to residences, a major commercial and industrial area and a recreational area are also potentially impacted.  Note that there are no schools, hospitals or prisons/correction facilities within this area of concern. \n\n\nFlammable Alternative Case Scenario\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the plant is a VCE resulting from a release of the entire contents of two co-located vinyl chloride spheres.  The difference between the worst case scenario and the alternative case scenario is more favorable meteorological conditions than were used for the worst case, and that a lesser portion of the contents contribute to the VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this ARS is 0.5 miles as determined by RMPComp.

Because the processes at the plant regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  Please note that due to time constraints, BCP addressed the request for the \"last date\" on which a particular activity was completed by entering the most recent date for completion of that respective activity as of the final version of that section of this report. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBCP employees participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees are involved in the writing of procedures and development of the training materials that accompany them.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the process safety management program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each process safety program element.  In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that addresses process safety and employee safety issues.  Teams made up of employees and contractors meet on a regular basis to review and develop safety procedures, training programs, emergency response procedures, investigate process safety related incidents and report to the plant management safety team. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBCP has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees have been advised of the location of the process safety information and trained in how to use the information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known hazards such as those associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nBCP has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential process safety hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted by a team comprised of individuals who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures are made when the team finds such measures are necessary.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate sig"

The results and findings from these updates are documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nBCP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) shutdown, and (4) initial startup of a new process.  Temporary and emergency operating procedures are developed for each case prior to commencement of the operation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nTraining\n\nBCP has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in both safety issues and plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After an operator demonstrates (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, the operator can work independently.  In addition, all operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least once every three years.  All training is documented for each operator, including, the means used to verify that the operator comprehended the training.\n\nContractors\n\nBCP routinely employs contractors to work on or near process equipment.

The program includes a written test that requires an 80% passing score.  In addition, craftsmen must complete the eight-hour safety-training program for industrial workers provided by industry through the local safety council.  The training is maintained through annual refresher training.  The long-term contractors participate along with Borden Chemicals and Plastics employees as members of the safety teams tasked with the development of procedures, audits, accident investigation and training.  Additionally, Borden Chemicals and Plastics also provides monthly safety training for the contractor supervision.\n\n\nIn addition to the safety training, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find.  Each contractor employee is provided with a process overview and information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning work. BCP evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process. Plant personnel monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSR's)\n\nBCP conducts a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or major facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. When necessary, short-term interim measures are taken until the permanent fix is implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file for at least five years to supplement the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHA's and PHA revalidations.  A team of employees are permanently tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the investigation system for the over all benefit of BCP and associated industries.\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the process safety program is functioning properly, BCP periodically undergoes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required are being implemented.
