General accidental release and prevention policy of ITC Portwall\n\nIn this meat processing operation, we utilize anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during its use to prevent exposure to our workers, the surrounding community and the environment.\n\nIt is our policy at ITC Portwall to implement the requirements of the Risk Management Program by managing and operating this facility in full compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations that we are governed by.  The objective is to minimize the risk of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  Safety depends directly on our proper handling of ammonia.  Our plant personnel have been trained on the equipment operating procedures and the various safety devices that are incorporated in our facility to prevent the possibility of accidental releases.\n\nAs a Program Level 3 RMP facility, this site has an extensive process safety management (PSM) program and is committed to the implementation of this program and the prevention of toxic release from the ITC facility.\n\n2.  Stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nITC Portwall, located at 300 Portwall, Houston, TX operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant.  Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment.  The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion.  Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.  Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the a"

      "SummaryText": "ssociated energy.  The refrigeration cycle is a closed loop process.  The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling.  The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation, to an area where it is of no consequence.\n\nThe ITC Portwall facility uses ammonia refrigeration to maintain process rooms and warehouse cooler and freezers temperatures for various types of fresh and frozen food distributed to their customers.  The refrigeration system contains the following equipment: Seven compressors, three evaporative condensers, one high pressure receiver, one low pressure receiver, one Vemag, nineteen evaporators, four ammonia pump systems, four heat exchangers and a system purger.  The refrigeration system contains an estimated 11,000 pounds of aggregate ammonia.\n\nThere are approximately 650 employees at this facility which includes hourly and salary personnel.  This food processing operation facility receives and processes shipments of meat via tractor trailers approximately 8 hours a day, 6 days a week.\n\nThe potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n\nAlthough ammonia is a colorlessm tasteless liquid, it's dominant characteristic is its pungent, distinct odor.  Persons exposed to ammonia will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations, although these levels would not normally result in any health risks.  Risks from accidental exposure to ammonia in a vapor state are irritations to the eyes, nose and throat.  The extent of irritation depends on the exposure amount and length of time exposed.  Ammonia is classified non-flammable by the Department of Transportation.  Ammonia will burn, but only in a very narrow concentration level when accompanied with a constant ignition source.\n\n3.

This vessel's normal operating level is 8,500 pounds of liquid ammonia, approximately 75% of its total capacity.  Although the high pressure receiver is capable of holding 11,200 pounds, this exceeds engineering controls which limit the liquid level to a maximum of 80% at any time.  Considering the catastrophic possibility does exist for this vessel to release its entire contents, engineering controls incorporated into the system would normally prevent such a release.\n\nWorst case release scenario criteria for the ITC Portwall facility:\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario is represented by the release of ammonia vapor flashing from a ruptured ammonia liquid receiver (engine room is open to the outside air).\n\nAmmonia Quantity: 8,500 pounds\nRate of Release: 850 lbs/min.

High level switches are configured to high and low pressure receivers and the intercooler.  High level switches will shut down compressor operation during a high level condition.\n3.  All compressors are configured with critical safety controls (high pressure, low pressure, high oil temp cut-outs, etc.) to shut down the respective compressor in the event of an abnormal operating condition.\n4.  Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers and compressor oil separators to eliminate over pressurization conditions in those associated pieces of equipment.\n5.  Emergency system button is installed on the exterior of the south wall of the machinery room to enable system shutdown from outside the room in the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system.\n6.  Periodic Maintenance Program is performed based on the PSM Mechanical Integrity program to ensure the refrigeration system and its components are kept in optimum mechanical and operating status.
