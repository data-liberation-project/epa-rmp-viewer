The purpose of this RMP/PSM Manual is to assist with the prevention of accidental releases of toxic and flammable substances that can cause harm to the public, facility employees, and to the environment.\r\n\r\n1.1\tOperations\r\nNelson Brothers, LLC is located at 500 Old Baltimore Road in Parrish, Alabama. The site consists of 8 reactors and 60+ bulk storage tanks of raw materials and finished products.  The facility operates on a 24-hour, 7 day per week schedule. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia storage facility at the plant consists of a 10,000-gallon storage tank located on a concrete pad adjacent to the R-800 tank farm. Vapor and liquid connections are provided for receiving bulk ammonia deliveries by tank truck.  The deliveries are made and handled by a company (Tanner Industries) that has been manufacturing and transporting anhydrous ammonia for over 100 years.\r\n\r\n1.2\tApplicability\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored on site as a pressurized liquid in a 10,000-gallon aboveground storage tank (TK80543). The presence of approximately 52,000 pounds (i.e., greater than 10,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia requires compliance with EPA's RMP rules (Risk Management Program, 40 CFR 68) and OSHA's PSM rules (Process Safety Management, 29 CFR 1910.119). Details and drawings of the Alkyl Succinic Anhydride (ASA) manufacturing process that uses ammonia are available upon request\r\n\r\nThe facility is subject to RMP Program 3 requirements as specified in 40 CFR 68.10 based on the determination that the toxic endpoint for a worst-case release of anhydrous ammonia is within the vicinity of public receptors. \r\n\r\nThe facility submitted the initial Risk Management Plan to the EPA on January"

Storing it under pressure prevents it for vaporizing and makes it available for use in large volume. One cubic foot of anhydrous ammonia in a liquid state produces 855 cubic feet of ammonia gas\r\nWhen anhydrous ammonia is released from compression in a storage tank (200 psi) to the atmosphere (0 psi), the temperature drops from 100 &#8304;F to minus 28 &#8304;F. At this temperature, ammonia will freeze/burn human skin on contact and clothing can be frozen to the skin. Since anhydrous ammonia is stored under high pressure, a sudden rupture can shoot ammonia 10 to 20 feet from the point of release.\r\n\r\n2.3\tSafety Information - Equipment in the Process\r\n2.3.1\tMaterials of Construction\r\nThe following materials were used in the construction of the ammonia tank and supply lines:\r\n\u00bf\tTank shell \tSA-212-B-FO\r\n\u00bf\tPipe\tStainless Steel 316L\r\n\u00bf\tBolts\tSA-193-B7\r\n\u00bf\tNuts\tSA-194-2H\r\n\u00bf\tGaskets\tGarlock Nylon\r\nNote: Ammonia is corrosive to brass, copper and galvanized components and fittings. When these components and fittings come in contact with ammonia liquid or vapor, the metal will corrode and will fail. \r\n2.3.2\tPiping and Instrumentation Diagrams\r\nPiping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID) relevant to the Ammonia process are provided and include: \r\n\u00bf\tPID-NH3:  Ammonia Tank Drawing; \r\n\u00bf\tPID-R-800: R-800 Reactor Drawing and ASA Product flow diagram\r\n2.3.3\tRelief System Design & Design Basis\r\nRelief valves, located on the top of the ammonia storage tanks, were designed in accordance with the following guidelines:\r\n\u00bf\tAmerican National Standard Institute (ANSI) K61.1"

A release is controllable if the ammonia flow can be shut-off or contained without employees being exposed to health or safety risks, or where the rate of release does not pose immediate danger (e.g., a faint ammonia odor is evident). In this situation, notification should be made immediately to CONTROL ROOM to alert First Responders who are properly trained to shut down required processes, if necessary, and/or the ammonia gas flow. 3. A release is uncontrollable if attempts to shut-off or control the ammonia flow would place a person at a health or injury risk. In this situation, persons should not attempt to contain the release. Instead, they should evacuate the immediate area of the release by moving laterally or upwind of the release area and initiate notifications as indicated below.
