      "SummaryText": "KOCH NITROGEN COMPANY\n\nBeatrice Nitrogen Plant\nBeatrice, Nebraska\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR \nTHE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMPlan)\n\n\nIntroduction and Policies\n\nKoch Nitrogen Company (KNC) is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KNC\u00bfs management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility, and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of an ammonia unit and a UAN unit.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.  Periodically, ammonium polyphosphate is produced at the facility through the use of a portable unit that is brought into the plant.  Carbon dioxide, a by-product of the ammonia manufacturing process, is sold to a co-located third party (EPCO) as a gas, liquefied in the facility\u00bfs CO2 plant and sold, used in the UAN plant, or vented to the atmosphere.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are the only toxic substances regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that are pres"

An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 Prevention Program requirements.\n\nNitric acid, sulfuric acid, ammonium polyphosphate and urea ammonium nitrate are stored at the facility.  These substances are not subject to RMP reporting for reasons discussed below.  According to 40 CFR 68.130 Table 1, the 53% nitric acid stored at the facility is in a concentration lower than the minimum necessary to be considered an RMP substance (80%).  Sulfuric acid is stored at the facility; however, it is not a listed RMP substance.  Urea ammonium nitrate and ammonium polyphosphate are mixtures that do not contain RMP-regulated chemicals in concentrations greater than 1%, making these products exempt according to 40 CFR 68.115(b)(1).  Although these substances are not subject to RMP reporting, the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant handles them in a safe manner.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n  \nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n\u00bfOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\n\u00bfOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n\u00bfOperating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\n\u00bfCorrecting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Beatrice Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.

Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of accident prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a continuous pilot in the flare.\n\u00bfMinimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup UPS in place.\n\u00bfProviding a low-amp trip system to shut down ammonia loading pumps during product movement, in order to prevent a release of ammonia.\n\u00bfInstalling chlorine detectors to help ensure that a chlorine release is detected and terminated as soon as possible.\n\u00bfInstalling low-pressure trip switches on ammonia loading hoses to stop product transfer in the event of a hose rupture.\n\u00bfRequiring personnel protective equipment at all loading areas and supply emergency air equipment in the control rooms.\n\u00bfManning the facility 24 hours a day to monitor all loading operations.\n\u00bfProviding emergency shutdown buttons at the truck loading area that can be activated by KNC personnel or the truck driver in case of an ammonia release.\n\u00bfEquipping the rail loading scale with an automatic shutdown that will prohibit further product movement upon reaching the weight of a full railcar.  \n\u00bfRequiring a brake lock system that prevents truck drivers from driving away before the loading hose is properly disconnected.\n\u00bfProviding level indications on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\n\u00bfProviding a fire water system to help with vapor control in the event of an ammonia or chlorine release.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the last five years, the Beatrice Nitrogen Plant has experienced two incidents that may be reportable in the five-year accident history of the RMP regulation.  The first incident occurred on June 27, 2006 a"

The second occurred on January 9, 2008 and resulted in a reportable injury.\n\nIt is not clear that the June 2006 incident is reportable under the RMP regulation, as KNC does not have information that qualifies the incident for reporting under 68.42(a) [a formal shelter-in-place was never initiated].  Nevertheless, KNC is reporting this incident in the RMP.  \n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any necessary emergency response actions with the Gage County LEPC, which includes the Beatrice Rural Fire Department and the Gage County Sheriff Department.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Beatrice Hazardous Materials Team, Beatrice Community Hospital, the Nebraska State Patrol, Norris Public Power, Kinder Morgan and Aquila (natural gas suppliers).  The Beatrice Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n\u00bfThe Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n\u00bfThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual impr"

The facility coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
