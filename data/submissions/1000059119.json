The partner has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the PSM elements. \r\nFive-Year Accident History; \r\nRoyal Madera Vineyards has not had any accidental releases from the ammonia-based refrigeration system that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years. \r\nEmergency Response Program; \r\nRoyal Madera Vineyards has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. However, an \r\nemergency response program does not need to be developed for the facility since Royal Madera Vineyards employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facility is included in the com munity \r\nemergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders. \r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety; \r\nRoyal Madera Vineyards relies on the expertise of qualified ammonia refrigeration contractors to regularly evaluate the need for any changes to the refrigeration equipment and to improve safety. Currently, Royal Madera Vineyards does not have any changes planned to improve safety associated with the ammonia refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion; Royal Madera Vineyards considered earthquakes as an external event on the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). The recommendation resulting from this is to have a licensed PE or company that specializes in Ammonia Refrigeration Systems conduct a Mechanical Integrity Audit every 3 years. Royal Madera has done so and has now adapted this recommendation into their safe work practices (SWP)."

As it is Royal Madera Vineyards policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations, the cold storage facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Building Code and Uniform Mechanical Codes. \r\nAdditionally, Royal Madera Vineyards has developed and implemented a PSM program for the refrigeration systems. As part of the PSM program Royal Madera Vineyards completed process hazard analyses. Royal Madera Vineyards utilizes contractors to implement a preventative maintenance program and mechanical integrity program to ensure that the refrigeration equipment is maintained in good operating condition. Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release. \r\nPersonnel from Royal Madera Vineyards monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration systems. All service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration systems are contracted to a qualified and licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration. Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \r\nWhile it is Royal Madera Vineyards objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations. As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Royal Madera Vineyards facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established. \r\nRoyal Madera Vineyards has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Check list which is used to evaluate Compliance with the CalOSHA regulations. At least every three years, Royal Madera Vineyards audits these programs and any findings of non-compliance are"
