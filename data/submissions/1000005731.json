Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Wellman Farm Center, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Washington County LEPC, the local fire department(s) and / or other authorities to mitigate and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 326,000 pounds in two storage tanks of 12,000 gallons each and thirty-four nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst and Alternative Case Scenarios:  The Worst Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas (liquified under pressure) over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 56,000 pounds which represents the entire volume of that tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is estimated to be 2.8 miles.  \n\nThe Alternative Case Scenario is a release from a 1-inch transfer hose resulting in the release of anhydrous ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow valve intervenes.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint of dispersion is estimated to be 0.3 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, 29 CFR 1910.111 of the United States Occupational Safety and Health A"

Compliance with the aforementioned regulations and standards helps prevent accidents.  Pressure gauges and pressure relief devices are also located on all tanks, piping, pumps and hoses to ensure pressures do not exceed maximum allowable limits.  All tanks, piping, valves, pumps and hoses are constructed of materials suitable for use with anhydrous ammonia.  All compliance efforts are directed toward the mitigation or elimination of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that have caused death, injuries or significant property damage, nor to our knowledge have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage of environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  In case of incident, the Emergency Coordinator is to sound the alarm, call the proper authorities, gather all personnnel on hand at rendezvous point and begin securing the area.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  In order to allow for better and continual monitoring of the system's integrity, all underground piping currently in use will be replaced with above-ground guttered piping.  Additionally, during the most recent Hazard Review, minor deficiencies were noted.  The piping and all other deficiencies will be corrected before 9/30/09.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use o"
