This  is\ndemonstrated by our  accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the storage and distribution processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release were to occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also coordinated with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. The Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities at our facility encompass warehousing and wholesaling of chemicals.  We have two substances present at our facility that are regulated under the EPA Risk Management Regulation.  These substances (2, 4 toluene diisocyanate and 2, 6 toluene diisocyanate) are used as  reactants in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers.  No manufacturing of any type or processsing of toluene diisocyanate or any other chemical takes place at this facility.  There are two covered processes at our facility: storage of toluene diisocyanate in 55 gallon drums with a maximum inventory of 223,000 lbs.; and storage of toluene diisocyanate in bulk containers (a storage tank and a rail car) with a maximum inventory of 488,000 lbs.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps: We have taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements.  All materials are stored in containeers constructed according to Federal Department of Transportaion (DOT) requirements.  The closed containers are stored in accordance with the National Fire Protection Agency  (NFPA) codes.  Contai"

In addition, the following elements of the release prevention program are in place at our facility.\n- Employee Participation \n-Process Safety Information\n-Process Hazard Analysis\n-Operating Procedures\n-Training\n-Contractor Safety\n-Pre-startup Reviews\n-Mechanical Integrity\n-Safe Work Practices\n-Management of Change\n-Incident Investigation\n-Compliance Audits\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\nDue to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during the last 5 years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\nOur facility maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nFindings that have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program have been addressed.  No additional changes are planned."
