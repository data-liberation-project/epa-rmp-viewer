The hazards of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in use and handling to minimize the possibility of human and environmental exposure in both the workplace and community. \r\nIt is Illinois-American Water Company's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety is inherent on the manner that covered process chemicals are handled and used, the safety  devices employed in the design of the feed system, as well as operating procedures and training of employees. \r\n\r\nThe Emergency Action Plan is based on OSHA Standards 29CFR 1910.38, 29CFR 1910.120 and experience gained from community drills.\r\n\r\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nChlorine: Greenish-yellow gas with a pungent irritating odor.  Chlorine is liquified under pressure but is used as a gas at ambient temperature.\r\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at this facility is 40,000 pounds.  The chlorine is delivered by truck in 1-ton cylinders. Liquid chlorine is evaporated into gas inside the cylinder.  The gas is fed by vacuum into the system and metered through a chlorinator, and then diffused into the flow stream of water at the point of application.\r\n\r\nSenior management is committed to the safe operation of our facilities and cognizant of the impact any deviation in processes might have on the surrounding community.\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThis facility and process uses design codes and standards from the Chlorine Institute, Wallace & Tiernan manuals, American National Standards Institute, American Society for Testing and Materials, and applicable state codes and regulations.\r\nThe vacuum system by which chlorine is fed is designed to close the regulator and shut the feed of chlorine off at t"

Fire department inspections/tours are conducted annually, verifying on-site chemicals, storage locations, quantities, chemical hazards, special instructions and requirements.  Drills at the facility are coordinated with the local fire department.  Public notification is handled in accordance with the guidelines in our emergency action plan.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nAlthough there are no immediate plans for changes to improve safety at the facility, we constantly review advancement in safety and process technology in the continuing pursuit to provide a safer workplace and community."
