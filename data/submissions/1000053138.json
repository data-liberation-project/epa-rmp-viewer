Through an extensive Research and Development Center located in Lawrenceville, Georgia, Anitox has developed animal feed additives that enable all species of animals to grow healthier, faster and more economical.  Anitox, and its products, are dedicated to consumer food safety, which begins with animal production.\n\n\n\nA primary goal for senior management at Anitox, as well as all employees, is to eliminate, or control, both known and potential safety and health hazards that exist in the work place.  Anitox goes to great lengths to accomplish this goal including the use of proper equipment, materials, manufacturing procedures and trained employees.  The safety program for Anitox has received the  Safe Plant Award from the American Feed Industry Association in recognition of the number of man-hours worked without a lost time injury.  Anitox is committed to do all that is reasonable to protect our employees, our customers and the public from results of chemical releases or fire.  Anitox has not experienced any accidents in the last five years or since the revision of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for an emergency, Anitox insures that all public service agencies respsonsible for emergency response are kept informed and updated on the Anitox emergency action plan.  These agencies include, but are not limited to, the Gwinnett County Fire Department, the Gwinnett County Hazardous Material Response Team and also the Gwinnett Emergency Response Center.  Anitox has conducted facility tours, product training and issued copies of emergency action plans to these agencies.  The National Response Center and the State of Georgia Emergency Response Commission must be notified immediately in the event of a chemical release.\n\n\n\nAnydrous ammonia and Formaldehyde Solution are used in the manufactu"

The Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have determined anhydrous ammonia and formaldehyde solution to be hazardous materials.  Both governmental agencies have issued regulatory requirements addressing the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia and formaldehyde solution.  Anitox has incorporated into its safety programs the regulatory requirements of both Process Safety Management and Risk Management programs.  These regulatory programs include a focus on manufacturing procedures, safety procedures, proper maintenance of processing equipment that handle hazardous materials as well as employee training in all of these areas.\n\n\n\nAnitox continually strives to stay informed of new technology in the areas of safety and manufacturing processes.  Continuous training of on-site personnel and emergency response agencies enables Anitox to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies should they occur.  Anitox is committed to uphold our reputation as environmental stewards within the community.  Anitox views itself as a business partner, who in conjunction with other businesses and the general public, can preserve and protect the environment in which we all live.\n\n\n\nRespectfully,\n\n\n\nChris Barnes\n\nGlobal Head of Supply Chain & Procurement"
