              "Description": "The process include the unloading, transporting, storage and loading of chlorine in approved cylinders. The process do not include any transfer, filling, dispensing of the chemical. These cylinders are maintained, tested and certified before they are filled and approved for shipment to Guam by the supplier. The scope of prevention therefore that is required is the safe unloading(preventing damage to the cylinders), secured storage (no movement or tipping, no flying debris due to earthquake and typhoons, forklift operation and fire)and safe loading to customers's transport vehicles. This process therefore, is basically handling, storage, and most important is the inspection of the cylinders upon arrival from off-island shipment. The hazardsidentified are easily preventable by the constant application of the basic safety procedures that were developed and  is now being implemented by the management. In addition, the best prevention program also now in placed is the training of personnel and the application of these training, together with the availability of the required safety and emergency equipment, which the management had procured for this program. Basic safety program such as good housekeeping, trash free yard and orderly designation of spaces, trained operators(forklift) are the most important  part of the prevention of any foreseeable hazard that could possibly occur with the limited process.",
