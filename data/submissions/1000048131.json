Approximately 11 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCF/D) of natural gas is handled by Newfield's Monument Butte Compressor Station. The gas is rich in hydrocarbon liquids to the extent that is exceeds specifications for gas pipeline transportation and sales.  The Monument Butte Compressor Station uses a Joules-Thomson (JT) unit to condense and remove heavy hydrocarbons out of the gas stream to meet required gas pipeline specifications.  The liquid hydrocarbons are removed and stored in a 23,500 gallon aboveground pressure vessel.  The liquid hydrocarbons are then transported via high pressure tanker truck to a fractionation facility for further processing.\n\n\n\nThe Monument Butte Compressor Station is located eight miles south of the city of Myton, Utah.  The station is located at SE/SW Section 25, Township 8S, Range 16E, Myton, UT, 84052 in a remote area surrounded by oil field well sites.  There are no public receptors in the area.  The Newfield field office is located approximately four miles northwest of the compressor station in Section 10 T4S, R1W.  The compressor station is normally unmanned; however, the facility is inspected daily by Newfield personnel and tanker truck personnel.  \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at your facility.\n\nThis facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to isolate and shutdown operations and stay away until the situation is safe.  Liquid hydrocarbons will also be removed if possible without endangering personnel.  Once the site is determined to be safe, equipment will be repaired.
