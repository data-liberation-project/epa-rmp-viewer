Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Northern Cooperative Services in Wadena are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Wadena Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank  at our facility in Wadena (Figure 1, ammonia).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons ( 131,223 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of  85%.\n\nWe also have propane stored in a 30,000-gallon tank located at our facility in Wadena (Figure 1,\npropane).  The maximum amount stored is 25,500 gallons (107,686.5 pounds) at the maximum fill\ncapacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the \nanhydrous ammonia stora"

At\nClass F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban topography, the maximum distance\nto a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 5.2 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated population within a 5.2 -mile\nradius of this facility is 6,000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\nscenario involves the release of 7616.42  pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).

At Class F atmospheric\nstability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is  0.38\nmiles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial demolition of houses and can result\nin serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated population within a 0.38 -mile radius\nof this facility is 50.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral\nweather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.12  mile (Figure\n3).  The estimated population within a 0.12 -mile radius of this facility is  30.\n\n  4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Inform"
