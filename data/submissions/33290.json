Equistar trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, Equistar works with the area industry, the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.  Response activities have been discussed with the Local Emergency Planning Committee and the Douglas County Mutual Aid Association.\r\n\r\nEquistar is an active participant in the community: The Tuscola Plant actively participates in and is committed to the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care(r) initiative. The plant, in conjunction with local emergency responders, conducts emergency drills to ensure community wide preparedness in case of an incident at the plant.  The plant also hosts an annual Responsible Care(r) Day to communicate our progress on the Responsible Care(r)  initiatives to local government officials, media, responders, members of the regulatory community and others.\r\n\r\nEvery second year, the plant holds a community open house with plant tours, demonstrations, exhibits and an opportunity for anyone to stop by and talk to plant management and other employees.  Finally, anyone is welcome,"

The stationary source and the regulated substances handled (\u00a7 68.155 b):\r\n\r\nEquistar's Tuscola Plant is located on an 800-acre site and began operations in 1953. The stationary source consists of ethanol and ether production, alcohol denaturing, specialty polymers, and support facilities. The Tuscola Plant's key products are ethyl alcohol, ethyl ether, powdered polyethylene and polypropylene (Microthene-F) and a compounded polyethylene product.  The plant also receives vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) and acetic acid for repackaging and shipment \r\nto customers. The feedstock used for ethanol and ether is ethylene. The feedstock for the powders and compounds is pelletized polymer produced at other Equistar sites.  All feedstock arrives at the facility by pipeline, railcar and/or truck.\r\n\r\nThe following facilities (processes) at the Tuscola Plant are covered under the RMP Rule: \r\nDenaturing Plant (includes Chemical Loading Area), Alcohol Plant (includes Synthesis and Finishing, Ether Purification Unit, and Tank Farm). The Tuscola Plant handles one regulated toxic - vinyl acetate monomer - and three flammable substances - ethyl ether, ethylene, and acetaldehyde - in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule and falls under the Level 3 Program. \r\n\r\n3. The worst-case release scenarios and the alternate release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario (\u00a7 68.155c):\r\n\r\nThe Tuscola Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance that may affect the public or the environment.
