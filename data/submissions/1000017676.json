Note that this facility is covered by 29 CFR 1910.119, so most dates indicated below are the most recent review/revision of the item and not necessarily the date first in compliance. The last PHA conducted for the Plant 1.0 Facility - Silane storage, loading and venting portion of the process was August 18th, 2010. The A?date of the last Plant 1.0 PHAA? is provided for the Plant 1.0 Silane storage, loading and venting.  The schedule for conducting the PHAA?s is summarized in REC Procedure PSM 30.003 Process Hazard Analysis.  The major hazards, process controls, mitigation systems, and monitoring/detection systems are identified considering all of the PHAs conducted on the covered process.  Note that in all cases, A?major hazardsA? were identified as those hazards possible in the absence of process controls, test and inspection programs, and mitigation systems.\n\nThe following schedule is the date of the last PHA revalidations of covered processes in Plant 1.0. \nHydrogenation                 01/18/10\n02 and 08 distillation             08/28/06\nSilane Storage and loading        08/16/10\nTDF-A/C                    10/16/07\nTDF-B Reactors                10/17/07\nTDF-H Reactors                03/20/06\nTDF-J Reactors                03/20/06\n03/04/07 Process Headers             01/31/06\n09 Process Headers             01/31/06\n09 Wash Station                    02/01/06\nFluid Bed Reactor            06/30/09\n \n",

REC occupies a 194-acre plot, which is located 5 miles east of Moses Lake, Washington on Road \"N\" NE.  The neighborhood is predominantly agricultural with several food processing plants, another chemical manufacturing facility, an industrial insulation manufacturing facility, an industrial gas cylinder filling facility, gas manufacturing facility, and a corrugated cardboard production plant are in the vicinity.  REC silicon employs approximately 520 employees.  \n\nProcess Overview \n\nThe REC Silicon facility in Moses Lake, WA is comprised of seven different production units: 1) Three Silane units, 2) Poly Reaction 3) Fluidized Bed Reaction  4)  Process Development Facility and 5) The silane loading Facility\n\nThe Silane Unit, through a series of chemical reactions and separation steps, converts metallurgical silicon and hydrogen to a high purity silane gas.  Intermediates produced in the process are trichlorosilane and dichlorosilane.  The Poly Reaction and Fluidized Bed Reactor Units use the silane and convert it into hydrogen and polycrystalline silicon.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the Silane Unit.  The Process Development Facility, which investigates new methods for producing polycrystalline silicon, also uses silane. Silane gas is also processed through the loading building where it is packaged for commerce in DOT approved tubular modules.\n\nThere is one covered \"process\" as defined by the RMP regulations at the Moses Lake facility.  This process includes the Silane, Poly and Fluid Bed Reaction production areas the Process Development Facility and the Silane loading facility (which are interconnected), and the silane module storage area located adjacent to the Silane loading building. Together these areas are identified as the Polysilicon Manufacturing"

Risks from both these non RMP-covered chemicals as well as the RMP-covered chemicals are minimized using similar design standards, procedures, controls, mitigation measures, and emergency response procedures.   REC Silicon is also working with the local Department of Emergency Management and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to coordinate emergency planning and emergency response for all potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nAccident History\n\nIn the past five years REC Silicon has had no accidental releases meeting the criteria for reporting in the risk management.\n \nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nREC Silicon's accidental release prevention program is based on the following essential elements: hazard reviews of equipment and processes, preventative and predictive maintenance programs, a management of change program, operator job certification and performance testing, accurate operating procedures, internal and external auditing and inspection programs, accident and near-miss investigations, etc.  Advanced process monitoring and control systems are in use at the facility, and critical parameters are monitored with duplicate instrumentation including Layers of Protection Analysis, and Safety Instrumented Systems.

REC Silicon is known as an industry leader in silane handling safety.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nREC Silicon's emergency response program has been coordinated with the local Department of Emergency Management and LEPC.  The program includes information on locations, quantities, and associated hazards of materials at the facility, as well as fixed and portable methods for containment and/or suppression of spills and releases, internal and external notification and communications procedures, alarm systems and evacuation plans.  The facility itself is designed with numerous mitigating features, including containment and diking, deluge systems for fire and vapor suppression, strategically-placed fire hydrants and fire monitors, and emergency scrubber systems.  Automatic and manual shutdown systems as well as automatic isolation valves are in place.  Back-up fire water supplies and firewater pumps are installed.  Emergency equipment is routinely maintained and tested.  In addition, REC Silicon maintains a highly trained emergency response team on-site 24-hours a day. The team performs realistic monthly drills and exercises, covering a variety of response scenarios such as spill containment and cleanup, vapor suppression, fire fighting, and response to injuries.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nREC Silicon continues to seek and identify opportunities to improve safety through process hazard analyses, safety reviews and inspections, internal and external audits, incident and near-miss investigations, employee and safety committee suggestions. Additionally, the facility has successfully implemented a Behavioral Based Safety process, which assists employees in identifying A?At Risks BehaviorA?"
