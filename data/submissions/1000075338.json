      "SummaryText": "The GExecutive Summary\r\nIntroduction\r\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment and are an integral part of everyone's daily lives.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  The Green Bay Water Utility (GBWU) Lake Water Pump Station uses chemicals, too.  The pump station uses chlorine to disinfect our water supply to provide safe drinking water.  The natural world contains more that 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds.  Human cells generate hypochlorite, a form of chlorine to fight infection.  Chlorine  purifies our drinking water, disinfects our swimming pools and is truly life saving.  In face the World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children worldwide die every day from waterborne diseases resulting from the lack of a water disinfection agent such as chlorine. Storing chemicals can be a hazard.  We take our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we take providing safe drinking water.  We at the GBWU Lake Water Pump Station have generated a Risk Management Plan that describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take everyday to ensure that our pump station operates safely, and what we do in the event of an emergency.\r\nBackground\r\nThe USEPA's Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a formal plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment.  Before these regulations were in place, the GBWU Lake Water Pump Station had already established many of the components of the plan.  The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 CFR Part 68.  In addition to the RMP, OSHA required that facilities develop plans to prvide safe work environments.  The OSHA plan is known as Process Safety Management (PSM).  Becau"

      "SummaryText": "se the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also sere as the OSHA PSM plan, and this document is therefore is referred to as the RMP?PSM plan.  The GBWU Lake Water Pump Station stores chlorine for disinfection in qualities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP/PSM is required.\r\nChlorine Process Safety Systems\r\nThe GBWU Lake Water Pump Station is an unmanned facility that stores chlorine in a 1-ton containers.  Chlorine is mixed with the treated water prior to being pumped to homes and businesses.  Chlorine is non-explosive and non-flammable, however, like oxygen it is capable of combustion under some curcumstances.  In addition, it is an irritant to the respiratory system, eyes, and skin.  Exposure through inhalation at high concentrations is toxic.  To prevent accidental releases from occurring that may cause these injuries, the GBWU Lake Water Pump Station has several safety systems.  These systems along with the Prevention Prgram described below greatly reduce the possibility of a significant release of chlorine from occurring.  One safety system is the chlorine leak detectors that continuously monitor for leaks in the chlorine storage area.  Even the smallest of leaks activates alarms that immediately alert pump station personal and allow them to prevent a potential release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  In addition, sensors monitor the system pressures and temperatures to detect abnormal conditions that may indicate that a chlorine leak is about to occur.  These monitors allow corrective actions to be taken before may occur.  To date, the safety systems in place have allowed GBWU Lake Water Pump Station to achieve an excellent record in preventing accidents.\r\nSafety systems help reduce or eliminate the consequenses of an accident, much like seat belts reduce injuries in car accidents and anti-lock brakes help avoid car accidents.  But, unfortunatly accidents can occur.  By being prepared for an acci"

At the GBWU Lake Water Pump Station they prepare for an accidental release by planning a course of action to address and handle the situation.  The Emergency Response Program Details appropriate course of action to be taken in the event in a release and is designed to protect people inside as well as outside of the pump station.  The combination of safety systems and the Emergency Response Program greatly reduces the risk due to the potential accidental release  for people inside and near by the pump station.\r\nComponents of the RMP\r\nThe RMP/PSM consists of three major parts.  The first part is Hazard Assessment.  The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public.  The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the liklihood of a release.  The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur.  \r\nHazard Assessment\r\nA Capital Hazard Assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public.  For chlorine, the distance asset endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified.  The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios-a worst case and an alternative case.\r\nIf a release were ever to occur, the gas would be migrate as the wind pushes it in the prevailing wind direction.  The wind would move the gas in primarily one direction.  But the regulations view the release as thought it would spread in all directions.  In other words, someone located upwind of the release at the distance determined in the Hazard Assessment would not"

The emergency response procedures cover a release from the initial alarm stage through contacting responders and evacuation.  As part of the emergency response procedures there are plans for victim rescue and communication with additional support agencies.  It also addresses pump station site communication, emergency response equiptment, first aid, and medical treatment, and emergency response drills.

      "SummaryText": "be affected by the release.\r\nWorst-Case Scenario\r\nThe regulations require the development of a worse-case release scenario based on conservative consumptions.  For example, it is required to assume that the entire contents of the largest single container of chlorine will be released over 10 minutes.  This is unlikely to occur because of physical properties of chlorine would cause the chlorine to actually freeze over.  The frozen chlorine must then thaw to release further chlorine to the atmosphere.  This freeze- thaw cycle would slow the release.  Because of the freeze-thaw cycle the distance the chemical would travel is shorter than predicted.  In addition, the regulations require that active efforts to stop the release can not be considered.  In many scenarios active efforts to stop the release would reduce the amount released.  The regulations also require that the worse-case scenario assume conservative atmospheric conditions that result in a larger area of impact.\r\nThe hazard assessment requires that the toxic endpoint or distance from the point of release to a location at which the chemical concentration equals or exceeds a certain concentration must be determined.  That concentration is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irriversible or other serious health effects, or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.  Because the cloud from a chlorine leak would disperse relatively quickly, an individual at a toxic end point would be exposed to the exposure limit concentration for much less than the 1hour assumed by the limit period.  In addition, the exposure limit concentrations result in relatively minor health effects.  Therefore, an individual at the toxic end point would be effected less than the results of the worst-case scenario may imply.  Using these assumptions, computer modeling estimated that the distance to the"

      "SummaryText": "toxic end point would be 1.6 miles.\r\nAlternative Scenario\r\nThe RMP rule also requires that at least one alternative release scenario be evaluated.  The alternative scenarios reflect a type of release that is more likely to occur compared to the worst-case scenario.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider active actions to stop or contain the release and a more realistic release quantity and release rate.  Lastly, it assumes local, typical meteorology, which is more realistic than the conservative meterological conditions that must be assumed for the worst-case scenario.  The alternative release scenario for chlorine was a release of chemical through the pipe connecting the cylinder to the vacuum regulator.  The alternative release scenarios are considered to be more representative of the effects likely of the even of a release.  The distance that the alternative release of chlorine would travel was estimated to be 0.3 miles.  \r\nPrevention Program\r\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system saftey and decrease the likelihood of a release.\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe participation GBWU Pumping Section staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implamentation.  Employee participation is valuable because it increases the saftey and awareness of the staff and it allows the staff's experience in maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equiptment be compiled as part of a RMP program.

The PHA was done using a Checklist method.  Based on the results of the PHAs, changes in maintenance and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the GBWU Lake Water Pump Station were identified.  The changes that most affect the severity and likelihood of a release have been adopted by the GBWU Lake Water Pump Station and incorporated as part of the overall RMP/PSM Program.

A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup check list.  The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign Pre-startup Safety Review Form.  This form documents the process, and helps ensure that the review has been properly performed.  The Pre-startup Safety Review Form must be authorized before start up.\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nAn effective mechanical integrity program is one of the primary lines of defense against a release.  The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training.  The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.  The GBWU Pumping Section maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system (Datastream) to generate and prioritize work orders and schedules preventative maintenance (PM).  The Datastream system is used to generate work orders for preventative maintenance in addition to preventative maintenance, the GBWU Pumping Section staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equiptment malfunction or break down.
