Trafigura is required to comply with United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 because the facility stores butane on-site in quantities exceeding the rule threshold quantity for this substance.  In December 2013, Trafigura added six new 90,000-gallon pressurized butane bullet storage tanks to its existing operations and, as a result, is updating the its Risk Management Plan to reflect the expanded butane storage.  The following executive summary is provided in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.155.\r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nTrafigura is committed to operating and maintaining its butane operations in a safe and responsible manner.  Trafigura has developed and implemented accidental release prevention and emergency response provisions at the facility, including those required under the USEPA RMP rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The facility is also subject to other emergency plan regulations such as those under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990, state Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (ECPRA), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) rules.\r\n\r\n1.2 Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nTrafigura operates a petroleum product terminal located in Corpus Christi, Texas, which handles butane, a regulated flammable substance under RMP regulations.  Trafigura's butane marine loading activities consist of:\r\n\r\n* Butane transfer from trucks to pressurized bullet tanks or floating storage pressurized barges; \r\n\r\n* Butane transfer from pressurized bullet tanks to floating storage pressurized barges; and\r\n\r\n* Closed loop mar"

The present RMP update addresses changes to the process associated with the expanded butane storage.\r\n\r\nThe following maximum transfer rates are expected at the facility:\r\n\r\n* Trucks - Thirty butane trucks per day with a capacity of 200 barrels each and capable of being unloaded to bullet tanks or floating storage at a rate of 200 to 600 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\n* Existing pressurized butane bullet tanks - Four tanks with a capacity of 30,000 gallons each capable of being unloaded to floating storage at a rate of 200 to 600 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\n* New pressurized butane bullet tanks - Six tanks with a capacity of 90,000 gallons each capable of being unloaded to floating storage at a rate of 200 to 600 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\n* Floating storage barges - Up to three barges used with a capacity ranging from 15,000 to 18,000 barrels and capable of being unloaded to ocean going vessels at a rate of 1,400 gallons per minute.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe facility's general accident prevention program consists of compliance with USEPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations.  Key elements include:\r\n\r\n* Process Safety Information - Information regarding butane hazards, process technology, and process equipment is complied, updated, and made available to operating personnel.\r\n\r\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Analyses are conducted every five years with the objective of identifying, evaluating, and controlling the process hazards, and findings and recommendations are promptly addressed.\r\n\r\n* Operating Procedures - Procedures are developed and maintained up to date to provide instructions for safe operations of process equipment during various phases of operation.\r\n\r\n* Training - Initial and recurring training is provided to all employees involve"
