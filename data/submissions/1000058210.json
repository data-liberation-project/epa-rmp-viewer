ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES.\r\n\r\nOK Foods, we utilize anhydrous ammonia in a closed-circuit refrigeration system. OK Foods established; programs, procedures and safety devices to prevent exposure to personnel, community and surrounding enviroment also protect property assets. Policies have been created to comply with all Federal, State and Local regulations. OK Foods strives to prevent potential releases through continual, training and revisions of policies, programs and procedures. \r\n\r\nEmergency response program has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as other emergencies.  Working in conjunction with the Muldrow Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors.\r\n\r\n2.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the facility is the processing of poultry products. Utilizing one regulated substance above the threshold level: anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant for the refrigeration system, cooling and freezing.  An outside company is used to fill our main receiver tank.  Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration, cooling or freezing units.  Access to the site is restricted to facility refrigeration maintenance personnel, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\nThe maximum amount of ammonia stored at this facility is 61,969 pounds.\r\n\r\n3.  THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Scenario\r\nThe worst case scenario would be failure of the largest receiver and a release of its entire contents in 10 minutes. OK Foods policy restricts the carrying amount at any time to 80% of capacity, b"
