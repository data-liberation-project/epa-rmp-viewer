The prevention program includes assuring all process equipment and materials meet appropriate standards and code requirements, implementation of detailed safe operating procedures, an effective mechanical integrity program, and an extensive training program to assure that all personnel are thoroughly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia system.  Process controls include relief valves, check valves, automatic and manual shutoffs, excess flow devices, emergency power source, interlocks, alarms, and procedures.  Sudden surges in flow or pressure will cause strategically located automatic shutoff valves to close and isolate the system.  Water fogging sprays located at relief valves and unloading stations can be automatically activated by area monitoring devices triggered at preset concentration limits or manually activated by control room operators or storage facility operators.  The area at the storage facility is graded to control runoff for treatment.",

TVA exhibits progressive environmental leadership in managing its unified river and power system for multiple public benefits, including the production of reliable, competitively priced power.  TVA is committed to setting the standard for environmental excellence among utilities and federal agencies, and to making the Tennessee Valley a model in sustainable energy, resource, and economic development and management.  TVA assures that employees are aware of their environmental responsibilities; use effective environmental processes, and are held accountable for performance.\n\n\n\nTVA management and employees will be responsible for maintaining compliance with environmental requirements and striving for environmental excellence in performing their respective duties.  We will assure environmental protection and reduce risks to our employees and communities in which we operate through proper environmental review of new developments and through safe technologies, operating procedures, and emergency preparedness.  All activities will be conducted in accordance with current environmental and health and safety regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nII.

Description of Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information - TVA maintains documentation of safety information concerning chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs and specifications associated with the process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - TVA conducted comprehensive analyses of the process to ensure that hazards associated with the process were identified and controlled effectively.  The Hazardous and Operability Study (HAZOP) analysis methodology was used to assess the potential hazards of the process.  The study was conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, control logics, and process operations.  Findings resulting from the analysis were addressed.  The HAZOP analysis was conducted on April 28, 2014 to May 2, 2014 and a pre-startup HAZOP review was conducted on March 9, 2017.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - TVA has established and maintained procedures for safely conducting activities within our covered process.  The procedures cover various operational phase including initial startup, normal startup, normal shutdown, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown.  The information is readily available to operators and maintenance personnel involved in the process and the information is periodically reviewed to assure it is current.\n\n\n\nTraining - TVA's training program is comprehensive and is implemented to ensure that all personnel involved in the operation and maintenance of the process are properly trained in the safe operation and maintenance of the process and knowledgeable of the hazards of the process.  The personnel are provided with refresher training at least every three years or more often if needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - TVA conducts well documented maintenance checks on proce"

Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected promptly and safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - TVA maintains written procedures to manage changes in the process equipment, procedures and monitoring technology which assures that any changes meet regulatory requirements.  Personnel whose job tasks are affected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Review - A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process.  Established pre-startup safety review procedures assured that construction and installation of covered process equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\n\n \n\nCompliance Audits - TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The audits will be conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations - Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.  Procedures ensure that investigations are undertaken to identify the circumstances leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the situation surrounding the release does not reoccur.
