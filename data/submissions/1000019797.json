      "SummaryText": "Delta Trading is a crude oil blending, asphalt, and liquid petroleum products storage and transfer facility. Stored materials include butane, crude oil, NGLs (pentane), and ethanol. The facility has several storage tanks as well as loading and unloading racks for trucks and railcars. Ancillary capabilities include an emulsion plant and transshipping of hazardous and non-hazardous materials.  Crude oil blending and transferring is regulated by Cal OSHA Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, Title 8 California Code of Regulations 5189 and Title 19 California Code of Regulations 2735 California Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility elected to adopt the Program 3 requirements for all covered processes. The facility is currently implementing the Accidental Release Prevention Program described in this document.\n\nDelta Trading has a commitment to employee and public safety.  The commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in design, installation, operation, and maintenance of covered processes.  Delta Trading's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases.  However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained in appropriate response procedures.\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on 40 CFR Part 68 and Title 19 CCR 2735.  The program includes the following areas: Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Hot Work Permit, Contractors, Safety Management, and other programs to insure the safe operation of the facility.\n\nEmergency Response Policies are maintained in the facility's Process Safety Management Program. Delta Trading maintains an Emergency Response Plan in compliance with local emergency response agencies.  The Paloma Station has a "

      "SummaryText": "Hazardous Materials Business Plan on file with the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility operators are trained to shut off the source from a safe location or activate one of the emergency shutdown devices, contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the Fire Department.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10 and 19 CCR 2735.4(c)(1), this facility has not had an accidental release in the past 5 years.  This information was verified by the reviewing of records from the Kern County Environmental Health Department - Certified Unified Program Agency.\n\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario analyses were calculated by using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) software RMP*Comp.  The worst-case scenario and alternate release scenario were based on butane as the modeled substance.  The facility stores and transfers primarily crude and blended oil, of which butane is a component.  The worst-case release of 488,215 lbs. of liquefied butane indicates a one-psi overpressure distance of 0.6 miles.  This distance impacts public receptors at adjacent agriculture fields and employees at an adjacent biodiesel facility. No engineering controls were considered for this scenario. \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for this process is a break in transfer hose connection, resulting in a vapor cloud fire. This scenario could result in release of 16,835 lbs. of liquids over a thirty-five-minute period.  The maximum distance for this scenario is <0.1 miles as calculated by RMP*Comp. The process maintains mitigation measures consisting of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  \n\nA preliminary seismic walkthrough was conducted to fulfill the requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program, 19 CCR Part 2745.7 (q)(2).

      "SummaryText": " seismic walkthrough consisted of a visual inspection of the process area piping and vessels above grade.  Structural integrity below grade was not inspected.  Walkthrough considerations included the mechanical integrity of pipe, pipe supports, vessels and vessel supports, welds, flanges, valves, pressure safety valves, signs of surface corrosion, pipe stress points, foundation, drainage direction, fire control and interaction with other elements.\n\nThe references used for this walkthrough were the following:\n\nA?

Processes Unlimited International, Inc., Engineered Safety Section, CalARP Seismic Assessment Procedure, April 12, 1999\nA? Uniform Building Code, 1997 Edition, International Conference of Building Officials\n\nBased on the document \"Maps of Known Active Fault Near-Source Zones in California and Adjacent Portions of Nevada: Uniform Building Code 1997\", this facility resides outside the 15 kilometer contour of a Type A and outside the 10 kilometer contour of a Type B Near Source Fault Zones. \n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.  Delta Trading is committed to operations that are safe for employees and the surrounding community.\n\nDelta may periodically make modifications to the operations and safety programs to improve safe working conditions at the facility.\n"
