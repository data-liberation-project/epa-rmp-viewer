Introduction:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Niota terminal is an ammonia terminal that unloads ammonia barges from the Mississippi River into a storage tank.  The ammonia is then loaded into trucks for transportation to agricultural distribution centers.  The facility has been in operation since 1967.\n \nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Company Niota Terminal has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to plant personnel or contractors since operations began in 1967.\n\nB.  Accidental Release Prevention and Record: \n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Niota facility has an excellent safety record with no deaths to plant personnel or contractors since it was constructed in 1967.   In addition, the plant has operated without a lost time accident for over thirty two years.  There have been no RMP reportable releases of toxic chemicals in the last 5 years.\n \nC. Accidental Release Prevention Policies and Program:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen facility in Niota has incorporated a safety vision that states, \"We, the employees of Royster-Clark Nitrogen, utilize teamwork, communication, and education, with the full support of management, to achieve safety excellence.\"   Royster-Clark Nitrogen employees utilize this vision statement as a reminder of the priority of achieving safety excellence.  Employees are highly involved in creating and implementing safety programs and safety systems at the facility, with a focus on continuous improvement.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program Steps:\n\n? Royster-Clark Nitrogen encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation include updating and compiling technical documents, networked computers that provide all employees instant access to up to date safety information, participation in Process Hazard Analyses, and continual employee training"

      "SummaryText": ". \n\n? Royster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.   Within this system, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n? Royster-Clark Nitrogen has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems. \n\n? Training of plant personnel includes: (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plans, and (4) applicable safe work practices. \n\n? Royster-Clark Nitrogen has a comprehensive system to manage changes to the processes.  This system requires that process changes be reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and verify that existing controls have not been compromised.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all affected personnel receive training on the change. \n\nD. Worst Case Scenario:\n\nThis facility has an anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  The tank is equipped with multiple levels of safeguards including three safety relief valves and a flare system to prevent tank overpressure.  In addition, there is a refrigeration compressor system that maintain the pressure of the tanks.  This scenario results in offsite consequences. \n\nBy law, the EPA requires the worst case scenario to be a catastrophic rupture of that tank with a compete loss of product over 10 minutes.  EPA makes this statement about worst case scenarios:\n\n\"Because the assumptions required for the worst-case analysis are very conservative, the results likely will be very conservative.  These endpoints are concentrations below which it is believed nearly all individuals could be exposed for one half-hour"

      "SummaryText": " to one hour without any serious health effects.  In addition, the worst case analysis is carried out using very conservative assumptions about weather and release conditions.  The distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger;  instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions.  Distances greater than 10 kilometers (6.25 miles) are particularly uncertain.  EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for a discussion?rather than a basis for specific actions.\"\n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes the chances for a catastrophic rupture are extremely unlikely because of the routine testing, plant safety systems, daily inspections, and constant monitoring.\n\nE. Anhydrous Ammonia Alternative Scenario:\n\nThe scenario are those which would create a maximum amount of loss of anhydrous ammonia from the ammonia accumulator.  The scenario involves breakage of the sight glass and failure of the ammonia check valve. There are off site consequences from this scenario.  \n\nRoyster-Clark Nitrogen believes the chances for a catastrophic rupture are extremely unlikely because of the routine testing, plant safety systems, daily inspections, and constant monitoring.\n\n \nF.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nThe Royster-Clark Nitrogen Niota facility has not had an RMP reportable accident in the last five years.  We are confident that the policies and programs in place at our facility will help us to maintain our record in the years ahead.\n\nG.  Emergency Response:\n\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan covers accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics.  The emergency response program is reviewed at least on an annual basis and continuously improved. \n\nI.  Summary\n\nThe plant safety record is the direct result of const"
