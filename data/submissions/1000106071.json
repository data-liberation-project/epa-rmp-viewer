This is achieved through participation in policy and SOP development as well as through the facility's RMP/PSM Training Program and participation in routine safety meetings.\n\nHot Work Permit\nFareva maintains a Hot Work Permit program in which a permit system has been developed to include safety considerations, fire protection, fire watch requirements, the time frame for the work to be conducted, the equipment to be worked on, the individual(s) responsible for the work, and approval of the supervisor.  Hot work permits are issued for all hot work performed in RMP covered process areas. \n\nContractors\nContractors provide service to Fareva in supplementing the work force and in providing specialized expertise in servicing covered process equipment.  Contractor safety performance is evaluated prior to approving a contractor for entrance to the site and conducting work in a covered area.  Contractors are required to complete training, are provided all applicable safety information, and are notified of the hazards in the area where they will be working.  Fareva regularly performs oversight of contractor work.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Fareva facility that meet the 5 Year Accident History criteria.  In the event the facility has an accident meeting the 5 Year Accident History criteria, Fareva will update the RMP within 6 months of the accident.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nFareva is considered to be a non-responding facility under 40 CFR Part 68.90.

This process ensures that all modifications other than replacement in kind are identified and are reviewed by qualified personnel prior to their implementation.\n\nPre-startup Review\nFareva has a policy indicating the necessity to perform a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) prior to the start of a new PSM-covered system and prior to implementing a change in a PSM-covered system that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The Fareva PSSR process confirms that 1) Construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications, 2) Safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and are adequate, and 3) For new stationary sources, a PHA has been performed and recommendations have been resolved or implemented, and modified sources meet the requirements of the facility's management of change program.  Documentation is in place to indicate that a pre-startup safety review was completed prior to the startup of the modified process.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCompliance audits of PSM-covered processes will be conducted at least every three years as required.  The audits will consist of a records review and an evaluation of on-site conditions and will be conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the processes and one person knowledgible in the RMP regulations.  Audits and corresponding findings and corrective actions will be documented.\n\nIncident Investigation\nIncident investigations will be conducted for incidents that result in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a covered chemical.  Investigation teams will be comprised of pertinent representatives and will be conducted within 48 hours of the incident.

Fareva has developed a series of SOPs for each regulated process to address each of these process steps.  Copies of the procedures are reviewed regularly (at a minimum annually) by operations personnel and are readily available on Fareva's computer network.\n\nTraining\nFareva provides classroom and on-the-job training to employees responsible for operating the covered process areas.  Each employee must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisor that they possess the skills and knowledge to perform the required duties prior to being assigned the responsibilities.  Operating procedure training is updated on a schedule of at least one every three years.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nFareva maintains written procedures to maintain the integrity and reliability of process equipment.  These procedures include instructions for the inspection and testing of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, including sensors, alarms, and interlocks, and pumps that are part of the PSM-covered processes.  Inspection and testing procedures are performed using recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  The frequency that inspections and testing occur is in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices and will be performed more frequently if test data indicates it is warranted.  Maintenance procedures and inspection and testing reports are documented in the PSM Cabinet and/or on the Fareva SharePoint network.\n\nManagement of Change\nFareva maintains a Management of Change policy and guidance procedures to implement a review"

The Finished Product Goods Storage area is subject to the Program Level 1 requirements of RMP and therefore, not required to comply with the Program 3 Prevention Program requirements.  However, the Storage area is subject to OSHA PSM requirements and therefore, is also included in the facility's PSM Plan. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nProcess Safety Information (PI) relating to the covered processes is divided into three categories: chemical hazards, process technology, and process equipment.  PSI relating to chemical hazards is included in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) that are maintained in readily-accessible locations for all employees.  PSI relating to process technology is indicated on process diagrams and is referenced in Operating Procedures and the Process Hazard Analysis.  PSI related to process equipment is located in process diagrams and equipment files maintained by the Engineering Department. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nProcess Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been conducted on the two regulated processes and will be conducted on each covered process every five years, or when a significant change in the process occurs.  The PHA for both of Fareva's covered processes was last conducted in November 2018.  PHAs are conducted by a team of knowledgeable individuals representing, at a minimum, operations, maintenance, engineering, and safety.  PHAs address the following items: (1) the hazards of the processes; (2) any previous events that had a likely potential for catastrophic release, (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards, (4) consequences of failure of those controls, (5) facility siting, (6) human factors, and (7) a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health effects on employees.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures for each part of the covered processes are maintained by the Engi"

Smaller (up to 400 lb) Dewar propellant storage vessels are also located adjacent to each gas house for temporary filling operations.  The cans are then returned to the building where they are packaged for distribution.\n\nThe aerosol can packaging lines (liquid fill, can capping, actuator insertion, and packaging) are located within the manufacturing building and therefore, are considered a separate process under RMP.  The liquid contents of the cans contain no regulated RMP constituents.  In addition, the packaging lines within the building do not manage cans in sufficient quantity to exceed any regulatory thresholds for flammable gases and therefore, the aerosol packaging area (liquid filling and post gas-house packaging) is not considered part of an RMP process.\n\nFinished Product Goods Storage:\n\nOnce the aerosol cans are packaged, they are palletized and transferred into the facility's warehouse area.  The warehouse area can store a maximum of 1,920 pallets of cans.  Based on the maximum amount of propellant stored in each can, Fareva has determined that the Finished Product Goods Storage area is a regulated RMP process.  \n\nPrevention Program\n\nFareva's Flammable Gas Storage and Filling Operation is subject to the Program Level 3 requirements of RMP.  A main component of the RMP Program 3 requirements is the implementation of a Program 3 Prevention Program.  However, the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements mirror the OSHA PSM requirements detailed at 29 CFR 1910.119.  Fareva has developed a PSM Policy Manual to implement the PSM requirements.  Therefore, the PSM Policy Manual includes all elements required under the RMP Program Level 3 Prevention Program detailed at Part 68, Subpart D (Sections 68.65 through 68.87).

The processes include:\n\n(1) Flammable Gas Filling Operations including Flammable Gas Storage and Transfer (Storage & Use of Flammable Gases for manufacture of propellant-based health care products), and \n\n(2) Finished Product Goods Storage (Storage of aerosol can products containing flammable gases). \n \nThe RMP regulated chemicals associated with both processes are Flammable Gases (e.g. propane, butane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, difluoroethane, and other mixed flammable gases associated with aerosol propellants).\n\nFlammable Gas Filling Operations including Flammable Gas Storage and Transfer:\n\nPropellants, as detailed above, are stored in five above-ground pressurized vessels ranging in size from 6,565 gallons (one tank) to 30,000 gallons (four tanks).  These tanks are stored outside of the aerosol manufacturing building, but are interconnected to the aerosol can gas-houses (filling stations).  Propellants are also stored in portable 400 lb Dewar vessels which are considered collocated with the gas houses.  Therefore, the propellant storage tanks, Dewar storage vessels, and aerosol gas houses are considered a single process for purposes of RMP applicability.\n\nThe aerosol can filling operations currently include five can manufacturing lines as follows: one bag-on-valve line, two rotary fill lines, and two indexing fill lines.  Each line generally consists of the following steps:  liquid content filling, can capping, propellant filling, actuator insertion, and packaging.  The liquid contents are filled into the cans within the aerosol can manufacturing operations building.  The cans are then capped and transferred via conveyor to the gas houses, which are located exterior to the manufacturing building.  Once in the gas ho"
