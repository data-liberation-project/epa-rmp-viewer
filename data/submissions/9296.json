Toby, Plant Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Centralia Fertilizer ( the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n- The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to  \n        Farmers.\n\n             -    Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application    \n         for crop production nutrients.\n\n- The maximum quantity stored would be 131,325 pounds in our 30,000 gallon  \n         storage  tank.   The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a tank \n         truck holding 44,000 pounds.\n \n3. The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of \n         a storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to \n         the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.41 miles.\n\nb. The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or \n         the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The \n         distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .5 miles.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\n              The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the \n         Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American \n         National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety \n         And Health Ad"

The Five-year Accident History \n\n              The following is a list of accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past \n      five  years that have occurred at the facility:\n\n      4\\22\\98; 10 to 20 pounds; with medical treatment to a fireman the next day due to \n      inhaling ammonia.  The accident was the result of a transport unloading at the \n      facility.  His transfer pump had a seal failure.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n- The facility has:\n\na. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 \nCFR 1910.38;\n                 \nb. provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and \ncommunity right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III\n(EPCCRA).\n       \nc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA \nstandard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n                 \n                    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic \n               Evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  \n               There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations \n               for implementation at this time."
