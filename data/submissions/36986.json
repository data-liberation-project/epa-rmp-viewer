      "SummaryText": "This Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been developed by Earth Sciences Consultants, Inc. (Earth Sciences) for tge West Leechburg Facility of Allegheny Ludlum Corporation located at Mill Bridge Road, Leechburg, Pennsylvania, and is pursuant to the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68. The West Leechburg RMP was reviewed and, where applicable, updated in June 2004.\n\nProcess Description and Regulated Substances\nThe West Leechburg facility has designed and operates one (1) process for the storage and transfer of 70 percent hydrofluoric acid (HF) into process tubs.  The process (Process No. 1) includes an 11,500-gallon storage tank located in a designated acid storage area and piping used to supply 70 percent HF to the process tubs. This process is located in a part of the plant that is designed for the storage, handling, and use of 70 percent HF.  The storage, handling, and use of 70 percent HF at the plant is hereafter referred to as \"Process No. 1\" in the remainder of this document.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for the facility is 331111.  The West Leechburg Facility process is classified as a Tier II program since the facility is not subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe West Leechburg Facility has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of hydrofluoric acid.  The West Leechburg facility remains committed to the prevention of releases of hydrofluoric acid.  In the event of a release, the West Leechburg facility is committed to a timely response in accordance with their Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency (PPC) Plan and the applicable components of this RMP.  Accident prevention and emergency response programs are described in this RMP.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe West Leec"

Finally, the Facility maintains the ongoing mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThere have been no accidental releases associated with these processes in the last 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe West Leechburg Facility maintains a PPC Plan/Spill Prevention Response/(SPR) Plan.  The  West Leechburg Facility has trained employees for an initial response team.  This team will don personal protective equipment (PPE) and be dispatched to control or stop a minor emergency or an accidental release or help move any employee(s) that has been affected by a 70 percent HF release.  If necessary, employees will be evacuated to a safe zone.\n\nIn the event of an emergency where off-site response is appropriate, it will be the policy of the West Leechburg Facility to notify the Westmoreland County 911 Center and/or the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and request that they respond to the emergency.  A fire, explosion, or other occurrence with the potential to create a release of the regulated substance (HF) from the process may pose a danger to public emergency responders.   Public emergency responders will not be permitted to enter this area except as previously arranged with the Primary Emergency Coordinator (PEC) or other designated p"

The emergency control center is sited in a safe zone and serves as the major communication link between the PEC and plant or corporate management as well as with local community officials.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNo additional measures to prevent off-site impacts from accidental releases have been identified or are required at this time.  If reasonable measures are subsequently identified that would lower the risk of an off-site release, such measures will be implemented.\n\nResponsible Person\nI, Deborah L. Calderazzo, Director of Environmental Affairs, have been assigned as the qualified person with the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP and subsequent program elements for the West Leechburg Facility of Allegheny Ludlum Corporation.\n\nCurrently, I have the responsibility for implementing the individual requirements of this RMP.
