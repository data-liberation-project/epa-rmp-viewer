      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe BFGoodrich Aerospace Spokane facility produces carbon brakes for aircraft.  Carbon textile material is received by the facility and is first cut, sized and prepared for the brake production process.  The textile is then sent to the furnace deck area where it undergoes carbonization and densification in a series of furnaces.  Next, the densified carbon brake parts are machined to the appropriate configuration.  Finally, the non-wearing surfaces of the brakes are coated with an oxidation inhibitor and mounting hardware is attached.  Some reprocessing of used brakes is also conducted at the facility.  In addition to the direct manufacturing activities, a variety of support operations are involved at the Spokane facility.  On-site laboratories perform both research and development, and quality assurance/quality control functions.  Both routine and non-routine maintenance is also conducted on vehicles and equipment.  \n\nPROPANE\n\nThe facility uses propane in the brake production process. The propane storage tank (18,000 gallon capacity) is located outside to the north of the cooling towers.   In accordance with the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 58 code, the propane tank is never filled to more than 88% of capacity (the propane vendor introduces an additional margin of safety by setting a target to fill  the tank to only 80% of the maximum volume).  The storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and contains 3 safety relief valves.  The propane tank fill pipes are protected from vehicle traffic within the facility by a guard rail. The immediate area surrounding the storage tank is fenced to prevent tampering.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario evaluated for propane at the facility involves the release of the entire tank (61,000 pounds) over a 10-minute period.  The propane is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and l"

Other assumptions include Atmospheric Stability Class F, an ambient temperature of 770 F, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and 50% relative humidity.  USEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Propane Storage Facilities (the Propane Guidance) was used to estimate the distance to the endpoint for this release scenario.\n\nThe Propane Guidance requires the calculation of the area surrounding the release point that is subjected to an overpressure greater than or equal to the endpoint. The endpoint (EP) is defined as the distance an explosion from an accidental propane release will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur.  For propane, the EP is an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  An overpressure below 1 psi is not likely to cause injuries that result from flying glass from shattered windows or falling debris from damaged structures.\n\nThe distance to the worst-case endpoint for propane provided by the Propane Guidance is 0.3 mile.  The population within this area is estimated to be 16 people, using the 1990 Census data and the LandView III database and mapping software package.  Of this population, two people are between the ages of 0 and 9, and two people are 65 years of age or older. There are no public or environmental receptors within the worst-case impact radius.\n\nAlthough a worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP Rule, a worst-case occurrence is a highly unlikely event.  The possibility of a catastrophic failure of the storage tank is extremely remote because (1) the storage tank is designed and constructed in accordance with industry standards (i.e. ASME and NFPA 58 Codes); (2) the tank is equipped with 3 safety relief valves to prevent overpressurization and catastrophic release, (3) theimmediate area s"

Additionally, the tank is not re-filled until it has reached approximately 30% capacity or less.\n\nETHANE\n\nThe facility maintains a fleet of three ethane trailers, two of which are on-site at any given time. Each trailer consists of eight storage vessels (maximum capacity 1,875 pounds of ethane). The third trailer is stored off-site, where it is filled by the ethane supplier. Upon notification by the facility, the third trailer is brought on-site and exchanged for an empty trailer. The maximum inventory of ethane is equal to the capacity of two full trailers (30,000 pounds of ethane).\n\nFor a worst-case release scenario, the facility must assume that the entire contents of one of the storage vessels (1,875 pounds) on an ethane trailer is released, a vapor cloud forms, and 10% of the cloud detonates. Other assumptions include Atmospheric Stability Class F, an ambient temperature of 770F, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, and 50% relative humidity.  The distance to the endpoint (EP) is defined as the distance an explosion from an accidental ethane release will travel before dissipating to the point that serious injuries from short-term exposures will no longer occur. For ethane, the EP is an overpressure of 1 psi. An overpressure below 1 psi is not likely to cause injuries that result from flying glass from shattered windows or falling debris from damaged structures. EPA's RMP*Comp (a computer software package) calculated the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case ethane release to be 0.1 mile.\n\nThe population affected by a worst-case release scenario for ethane was estimated using information from the 1990 Census data and LandView III, and then modified after comparing to a drive-around survey of the facility and surrounding areas.\n\nLandView III calculates populations within defined impact areas using two methods: the Block Group Unifor"

It then prorates the results based on the ratio of the portion of the Census Block that is actually inside the radius of impact. This method distributes the people in the Census Block evenly across the land area and counts only those assigned within the radius of impact. This method is useful when only small portions of the Census Block are located within the radius of impact.\n\nThe second method, the Group Centroid Method, finds all Census Blocks that have their centers inside the defined radius of impact. The populations of these blocks are added together, regardless of whether the entire block is inside the radius of impact or not. This method is most useful with impact radii greater than 1 mile in densely settled areas. \n\nBecause the worst-case impact area for an ethane release at the facility is relatively small, neither of these population estimation methods provide accurate results. The Group Centroid Method fails to provide any data because there are no centroids located within the radius of impact. The Block Group Uniform Population Density Method estimates two people within the worst-case impact radius. However, surveys of the surrounding area have shown that no residences are located within a 0.1 mile radius of the ethane trailers. The method is more useful for larger radii (e.g., those used for the propane release scenarios). Based on drive around surveys, it is appropriate to assign zero population within the ethane worst-case impact radius.  Additionally, there are no public or environmental receptors located in the impact radius.  \n\nThe ethane process is eligible for Program 1 of the Risk Management Program Rule because: (1) there are no residences or other public receptors within the worst-case impact area for ethane, (2) the facility has had no accidental release history with re"

The following sources of information were evaluated during the selection of a credible alternative-release scenario:  Previous hazard assessments, facility or industry incident reports, maintenance work orders, incident recall, technical judgment, and the scenarios listed in the Propane Guidance.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen represents the incident that is most likely to occur but is still severe enough to achieve the EP at the facility fence line. This scenario assumes that the propane truck driver forgets to remove the hoses between the storage truck and the transfer vehicle following delivery of propane.  In this case the loading hose is assumed to be 2 inches in diameter, and 15 feet in length.  The active mitigation measures such as breakaway fittings and valves work as designed limiting the release to approximately 11 pounds of propane, the contents of the hose. The Propane Guidance was used to estimate the distance to the EP, assuming the same vapor cloud explosion described in the worst-case scenario (the released vapor forms a cloud, of which 10 percent ignites).  The distance to the EP (1 psi) is calculated to be 0.02 miles.

The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n-Written operating procedures (OPs) are used to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the propane system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n-Propane system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based on the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to the propane process.\n\n-Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in a condition to be safely operated prior to startup.\n\n-Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of propane are subjected to a formal investigation.

Any deficiency found is corrected.  Note that as of the date of resubmission (January 2000), the facility's first RMP compliance audit had not yet been completed.  The compliance audit is required every three years, which would correspond to June 2002 -  three years from the date of the original submission (June 1999).  The resubmission was required in anticipation of the removal of the judicial stay that precluded BF Goodrich from submitting the RMP propane information in June, 1999.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe BFGoodrich Spokane Facility is subject to the following regulations which are related to emergency response:\n\n-OSHA's Emergency Action Plan Regulation - 2"

Although a prevention program is not required for the ethane system due to its Program 1 status, the ethane system is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, and BFGoodrich has developed similar prevention program elements to satisfy the PSM requirements for the ethane system.  The key components of the prevention program developed for the propane process are summarized below:\n\n-The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of propane and the design of the system and equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the propane system.\n\n-The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assumes that employees that utilize the propane system are the most knowledgeable about it and are able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n-The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA) on the propane system using the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study method.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing propane system on August 5 and 6, 1998, and analyzed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of t"
