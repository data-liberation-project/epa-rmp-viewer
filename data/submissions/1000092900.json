Currently the total amount is held to below 10,000 pounds. The plant has been operating as a research and development facility until the start of 2021. We now want to expand production to serve our company's needs for specialty polymers.\n\nWe located the plant in an industrial area and have contact with our neighbors to exchange information on chemicals used and operations performed on site. The local Fire Department was consulted regularly during planning and construction of the facility. All of the current Polymer Plant employees have been at the Polymer Plant since start up. The employees are trained in all SOP's and regularly update them, employees average 20 years of experience in chemical processes.\n\nThe Plant was designed from the ground up with polymer experts and engineering resources well versed in PSM and RMP requirements. We performed a PHA for the entire facility in advance of construction planning on amounts of chemicals eventually exceeding PSM and RMP limits. On November 15 -18, 2016, personnel from NIC Industries, Inc. (NIC), Norwest Engineering, Inc. (Norwest) and Process Engineering Associates, LLC (Process) met and teamed together to perform a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the design of the Polymer Pilot Plant to be built at NIC's White City facility.  The PHA met NIC's process safety objective of identifying process hazards associated with the process to reduce the risk that these hazards pose to employees and/or the public\n\nThe PHA team focused on those process hazards that could lead to significant safety or health consequences during routine (normal operations) and nonroutine (maintenance, etc.) phases of operation.  The team used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and checklist review techniques to perform the analysis.  Fifty-six (56) recommendations were identified duri"

      "SummaryText": "ng the PHA. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the chemical that will exceed PSM/RMP limits and the discussion for this executive summary will be focused on our preparations for the same. The plant is controlled by a programmable logic controller from the human machine interface in the control room. There are over 400 inputs from the plant that are controlled from the HMI that is backed up with a duplicate system and has battery back up. The control system combines information on tank levels, system pressures, flows and temperatures. There are multiple interlocks to ensure safe operating of the process. We use rupture disks and re sealing pressure relief devices to prevent over pressurizing the process. The rupture disks also employ a pressure sensing device to indicate that they have been activated. All tanks use re sealing PRD's and some process tanks also use rupture disks. These all vent to the emergency vent tank that is constantly purged with nitrogen and has an elevated vent to keep any vapors away from personnel. Pumps are protected with pressure relief devices that vent back to the tank. Two scrubbers handle vapors that are produced from routine line purges or prep for maintenance. We have air monitoring for ammonia in the work area and at the scrubbers. The plant is sprinkled for fire and has smoke detectors that are monitored by a third party alarm service. Air actuated devices have pressurized air provided by a compressor system that is also backed up by a redundant system and the plant has a backup air reservoir. Materials of construction were evaluated for chemical compatibility during the PHA and initial design.\n\nRaw materials are tracked by use in batch logs, and a monthly inventory is performed.\n\nNIC utilizes an Emergency Action Plan to coordinate emergency response, it covers the following topics: Fire Response, First Aid/AED, Loss of Utilities, Chemical Spills, Severe Weather, Active Shooter, workplace violence, emergency contacts, and evacuation.\n\nBelow is o"
