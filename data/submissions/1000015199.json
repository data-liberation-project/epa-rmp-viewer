This is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel and consideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of this facility. It is standing practice to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if an incidental release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond. Should an emergency occur, our policy is to notify the Harrison county fire department and request they respond and plant personnel are prepared to work with the fire department, LEPC and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Crossroads gas plant, located near Marshall, Texas, operates processes to extract petroleum products i.e. natural gas liquids (NGL) from field natural gas. NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including the regulated flammables ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes. The NGL product is shipped from the plant by pipeline. There are no threshold quantitiy of 112 ( r ) regulated toxic substances at this facility.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   \n\nThe gas plant complies with applicable rules and regulations in the design and construction of the plant and  the specification of equipment and its installation. Applicable codes and standards issued by ANSI, ASME, ASTM, API, NEMA and NFPA were consulted. \n\nThe processes at the gas plant that are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard. Large quantities of regulated flammable substances are not routinely stored.\n\nThe Crossroads gas plant has operating procedures and"

There is a training program for employees involved in operating and in maintaining equipment. Refresher training is also provided at regulatory required frequencies or more often if needed. Equipment manufacturers recommended maintenance intervals and procedures are used along with replacement parts that satisfy design specifications. \n\nProcess safety information includes technical documents that provide information about  process design, construction materials and equipment maintenance and are readily available to all employees as is specific chemical information. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Crossrods gas plant is less than5 years old.  There have been no offsite accidents within the previous the 5 year time period.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Crossroads gas plant maintains a written emergency action plan to protect workers, the publics safety as well as the environment. The emergency plan is tailored to this plant and will be updated as needed and employees informed of and trained in the changes before they are implemented. There are no 112 ( r ) threshold toxic substances on the plant site.  For a non-incidental release of a flammable substance, including the possibility of a fire, response actions have been coordinated with the Harrison county fire department and mechanisms for notification are in place.  \n\nThe Crossroads gas plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department)."
