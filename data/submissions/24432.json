This\n        adheres to all Federal, State, and local laws involving anhydrous ammonia. Employees will work with\n        all local fire and emergency departments to minimize impact of an accidental release of ammonia \n        should it occur.\n\n       2: Facilty Information - Anhydrous ammonia is stored in an 18,000 gallon tank that can be filled to 85%.\n        If tank is filled to capacity 95940 pounds of anhydrous ammonia can be stored. The anhydrous \n        ammonia is delivered by transport truck and used in the reaction process when combined with \n        railroad delivered super phosphric acid and water. This process creates a liquid fertilizer product \n        called ammonium phosphate solution ( 10-34-0 ) and heat. Evaporating the water in a tower with\n        a fan that pulls air through the product as it passes through baffles cools the finished product.\n\n        3: Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the entire contents of the storage tank. \n         This would be 95940 pounds in ten minutes. The distance to the toxic end point concentration \n         ( .14mg/L ) is 1.12 miles. This extends offsite and includes public receptors.\n         The Alternative Release Scenerio involves release of anhydrous ammonia from a rupture in a \n         2-inch diameter line during transfer from storage to the reactor. This scenerio would release 11,900\n         pounds in 2 minutese. Distance to toxic endpoint concentration ( .14mg/L ) is .56 miles.\n\n        4: Accident Release Program - This facility complies with the EPA's ac"

These procedures are reviewed and revised on\n         a regular basis.\n\n        5: Five Year Accident History - There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia\n         at this site during the last five years.\n\n        6: Emergency Response Program - This facility maintains a written emergency action plan to be\n         followed in the event oif a problem.\n\n         7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety - Evaluations of procedures and equipment are made \n          constantly and improvements are implemented as well."
