The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\r\n\r\n(5) Rooms\r\n\r\nThe refrigerated spaces are equipped with air-cooling evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly adjacent to the machinery room.

      "SummaryText": ", the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The suction gas is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to the main suction accumulator.  From the main suction accumulator, ammonia is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water-cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers.\r\n\r\nThe system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Aslan Cold Storage Kingsburg consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.  As such, the refrigeration system at Aslan Cold Storage Kingsburg is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\nAslan Cold Storage Kingsburg has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Aslan Cold Storage Kingsburg facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year.

In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.

Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Aslan Cold Storage Kingsburg has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Aslan Cold Storage Kingsburg now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Aslan Cold Storage Kingsburg employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.
