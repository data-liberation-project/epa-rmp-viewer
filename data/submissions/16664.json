      "SummaryText": "SOURCES AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nAMREP, Inc. manufactures specialized aerosol products at its facility located at 990 Industrial Park Drive in Marietta, Georgia.  As part of the manufacturing operations, aerosol propellants are transferred from storage tanks at the facility to individual product containers.  These chemicals are highly flammable substances that are carefully managed to minimize the risks of fire or explosion.\n\nThe chemicals that are present at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantities are as follows:\n\nPropane/Butane (50/50 Mixture)     58,370 lbs.     Tanks No. 3, 4, 15 and 16\nPropane/Butane (25/75 Mixture)     51,040 lbs.     Tanks No. 13 and 14\nTetrafluoroethylene\t\t         20,320 lbs.     Tanks No. 1 and 2.\n\nThe covered process, as defined by the Risk Management Program Rule, is the transfer of the listed chemicals into product containers on the two production lines.  Although the propane/butane mixture may be exempted from the RMP rule, AMREP has considered the effects of this hyrdocarbon mixture on the hazard analysis and accident prevention because the storage tanks containing the hydrocarbon mixtures are located near the tetrafluoroethylene storage tanks.\n\nSUMMARY OF MAJOR HAZARDS\n\nAMREP uses three chemicals in its manuracturing process that are considered highly flammable under the Risk Management Program Rule.  These chemicals are transferred from storage tanks to production areas and placed in product containers.  The main hazards associated with the covered process are fire and explosion resulting from an accidental chemical release. \n\nCONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE TO CONTROL HAZARDS\n\nIf a sufficient quantity of gas is accidentally released to the atmosphere and finds an ignition source, a fire or explosion could result that would have the potential for impacting property and population beyond the facility's property line.  The Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) performed to obtain figures relative to this plan demonstrate th"

      "FacilityID": 16664,
      "SummaryText": "at the worst-case scenario could result in an explosion that would impact areas within a radius of 0.24 miles.  The alternative-release scenario of the OCA could result in an explosion that would impact areas within a radius of 0.03 miles, or 180 feet, which would remain within the boundaries of the facility.\n\nHOW RELEASES ARE PREVENTED\n\nAMREP maintains a comprehensive prevention program as required by the Risk Management Program Rule, with the objective of preventing accidental releases and other accidents from the covered processes.  Access to the property and to individual areas of the facility is strictly controlled by an electronic security system.  An active explosion suppression system is installed in the gas rooms where the transfer of chemicals to product containers occurs.\n\nSTEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS HAZARDS\n\nAMREP has implemented a Process Safety Management Program, as required by OSHA, that includes a systematic review of the hazards at the facility and a comprehensive management system to address the identified hazards and improve process safety.  This program is fully integrated with the prevention program under the Risk Management Program Rule, so that the hazard analyses encompass accidental release prevention from covered processes.  All of these efforts are conducted under the direction of the Safety Department, which includes top-level management personnel. \n\nRESPONSE ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A RELEASE\n\nAMREP maintains a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan that addresses numerous potential emergencies at the facility, including a chemical release.  This plan provides specific guidance to employees for repsonding to emergencies and minimizing the negative consequences of accidents."
