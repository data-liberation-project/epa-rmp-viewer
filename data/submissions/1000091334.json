This program incorporates the following elements:  safety examination, hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance and compliance audits.                                                                                                                                                                                      \n\n4.

All employees are trained on this plan on a regular basis.  The Emergency Action Plan is available to all employees at all times in the workplace.\n\n6.  Constant Improvement\nInternal audits are conducted at least annually.  This facility completed the Responsible Care Certification process (January 2014) through the American Chemistry Council highlighting safety and operational processes of the facility."

This commitment is demonstrated by our activities to prevent accidental releases from the storage and distribution processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release were to occur, emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate with the local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.   \n\n                                                                                                                                           \n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled            \nOur facility's primary activities encompass storage and distribution of chemicals that serve the plastics and polyurethane dyes/pigments industries.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances, 2,4 toluene diisocyanate, and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate, are components in various mixtures.  There is no manufacturing or processing of the chemicals done at this distribution center.  The 2,4 toluene diisocyanate and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate are located in two separate processes: a bulk storage process which qualifies as a Program Level 2 process: and warehouse storage for drummed material which qualifies as a Program Level 1 process.           \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               3.
