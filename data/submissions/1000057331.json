      "SummaryText": "The Kemps Ice Cream Company, located in, Rochester, MN, is a production facility offering a range of dairy products. Kemps Ice Cream uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas. The Kemps Ice Cream refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 3 hg to a high side of 135 psi. The systems maximum intended inventory is 65,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\r\nThe Kemps Ice Cream worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the Low Pressure Receiver (V-16) in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the Low Pressure Receiver is 23,340 pounds at 100% full. Using EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention, Appendix E, Figure E-2, the calculated toxic endpoint was 1.17 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 18,000, within the area.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the Low Pressure Receiver (V-16) in the ammonia system. The vessel capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is described above. Although the worst case scenario is a requirement by the RMP ruling it is not a likely scenario to take place. Kemps Ice Cream Company follows the industrial standards to assure proper material is used in the ammonia refrigeration system. By following the industrial standards and the EPA / OSHA standards the shell failure unlikely.\r\n\r\nANSI/IIAR-2 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.\r\n\r\nANSI/ASHRAE 15-1992 Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration.\r\n\r\nASME/ANSI B31.5 Refrigeration Piping Code.\r\n\r\nASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.\r\n\r\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Bulletin 110 - Startup, Inspection and Maintenance of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration System.\r\n\r\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (I"

The alternative release chosen was a 1/4 inch diameter orifice on piping located on the high pressure side of the system, therefore at a maximum pressure of 135 psig.  Using a simplified version of the Bernoulli equation (based on the derivation in Appendix E of EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention), the release rate for the alternative scenario was 116 pounds per minute. The distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative case release is 0.10 miles. The estimated population within the distance would be 100 people. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency response Policies:\r\nThe Kemps Ice Cream Company has established steps to include initial training under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the emergency response team. as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release. Kemps Ice Cream Company has also coordinated efforts with the Rochester Fire Department to establish a joint response program. The Kemps Ice Cream established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually to assure that they are current and up to date.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nKemps Ice Cream Company has trained personnel that are the refrigeration operators to assure they can perform their responsibilities and procedures safely. The refrigeration operators receive training on the ammonia system when there is a change in the system and at minimum of every three years. Kemps Ice Cream has a"

The trained personnel have been trained at the level of the Technician Level Responder and also the Incident Commander on scene. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or a flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Kemps Ice Cream has established a written operating procedure for the ammonia system and has included in the procedure the Emergency Shutdown and Isolation in the event of a release.  The in-house emergency response team will coordinate their efforts with the outside Emergency Services to assure safety for all personnel.\r\n\r\n \r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\nEPA's RMP regulation defines accident as the following: \r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process. The release must have caused at least one of the following: \r\n\r\n\u00bf\tOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n\u00bf\tKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)). \r\n\r\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history revealed that there has been one release over the previous five years (May 2011 - May 2016) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in 24 hours or that meet the EPA reporting criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2015, during the 5-year relief valve replacement process, a pressure relief valve rated for 150 psi was installed by a refrigeration contractor on a compressor, instead of the appropriate 250 psi rated valve. The relief valve opened when system pressure reached 150 psi, releasing approximately 1,287 pounds of ammonia. At approximately 7:30 pm, an ammonia sensor alarmed at the fa"

Also that training with community services has been done and is on going. This is to ensure that in the event of an accidental release the Kemps Ice Cream trained personnel and the community emergency services can minimize the release and stop it with no impact to the employees or the community."
