Kemps Ice Cream uses Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for the production and storage areas. The Kemps Ice Cream refrigeration system is a closed loop system with normal operating pressures that range between a low side of 3\" hg to a high side of 135 psi. The systems maximum intended inventory is 65,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\n\nThe Kemps Ice Cream worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the Low Pressure Receiver (V-16) in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the Low Pressure Receiver is 23,340 pounds at 100% full. Using EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention, Appendix E, Figure E-2, the calculated toxic endpoint was 1.17 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 18,000, within the area.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the Low Pressure Receiver (V-16) in the ammonia system. The vessel capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is described above. Although the worst case scenario is a requirement by the RMP ruling it is not a likely scenario to take place. Kemps Ice Cream Company follows the industrial standards to assure proper material is used in the ammonia refrigeration system.

The alternative release chosen was a 1/4 inch diameter orifice on piping located on the high pressure side of the system, therefore at a maximum pressure of 135 psig.  Using a simplified version of the Bernoulli equation (based on the derivation in Appendix E of EPA's General Guidance on Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accident Prevention), the release rate for the alternative scenario was 116 pounds per minute. The distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative case release is 0.10 miles. The estimated population within the distance would be 100 people. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency response Policies:\n\nThe Kemps Ice Cream Company has established steps to include initial training under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the emergency response team. as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release. Kemps Ice Cream Company has also coordinated efforts with the Rochester Fire Department to establish a joint response program. The Kemps Ice Cream established plans and procedures are periodically reviewed and at least annually to assure that they are current and up to date.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nKemps Ice Cream Company has trained personnel that are the refrigeration operators to assure they can perform their responsibilities and procedures safely.
