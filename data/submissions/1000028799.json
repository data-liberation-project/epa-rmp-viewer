      "SummaryText": "Introduction\r\n\r\nThe previous RMP Plans for the chlorine disinfection system at the CLWA's Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant were submitted on June 16, 1999, June 16, 2004 and December 18, 2008.  Between 2009 and June 2011, the Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant was expanded.  The expansion project included the the construction of a new chlorine building and an increase in the maximum inventory of chlorine from 16 to 32 one-ton cylinders.\r\n\r\nFacility Description\r\n\r\nThe CLWA RVWTP is located at 27234 Bouquet Canyon Road in Santa Clarita, California. RVWTP is on a property covering 65 acres. RVWTP is provided State Project water stored in Castaic Lake. The plant is currently capable of treating 60 million gallons per day (mgd) of water with an additional future capacity of 120 mgd.  \r\n\r\nRaw water is first delivered to the pre-ozone contactor where ozone is applied for pre-oxidation and pre-disinfection. Ozonated water then enters the rapid mix structure where coagulants are added. The water is then fed to up-flow clarifiers, and then to a gravity filtration system. In the final stage, filtered water is disinfected with chlorine, monitored for chlorine residual, dosed with ammonia to create chloramines and released to CLWA's transmission system for distribution.\r\n\r\nPotentially hazardous chemicals stored and used onsite or for which storage is available include chlorine, aqueous ammonia (19%), hydrogen peroxide, diesel fuel, liquefied oxygen, and sodium hydroxide and polymer. Liquid chlorine, used for disinfection of water, is stored in one-ton cylinders. The maximum quantity of chlorine currently stored at the plant is currently 32 cylinders (64,000 pounds). Chlorine is present in quantities above the RMP threshold. The other chemicals are either addressed in a separate RMP Plans required by the State of California(i.e. aqueous ammonia), not covered under the RMP program, or are present in quantities below the thresholds. \r\n\r\nChemicals Subject to USEPA Risk Management Plan ("

The Safety Coordinator maintains the CCCP. The key elements of CLWA's emergency preparedness program are as follows:\r\n\r\n* The plant uses a combination of audible alarms and a plant loudspeaker system to alert the staff of a potential accident and to conduct in-plant communications.\r\n\r\n* In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact the Los Angeles County Fire Department and evacuate to designated staging areas.\r\n\r\n* In the event of an uncontroled chlorine release in the chlorine building, the scrubber system would activiate and remove/neutralize chlorine gas in the chlorine building. \r\n\r\nCLWA's Recent Steps to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nBased on CLWA's dedication to process safety and the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) review that was conducted in April 2011, CLWA has integrated the following components and procedures into the chlorine disinfection system to reduce the likelihood or severity of potential chlorine releases:\r\n* A chlorine gas detection system\r\n* An emergency chlorine shutoff system that will automatically activate if a chlorine gas leak i"
