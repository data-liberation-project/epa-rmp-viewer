      "SummaryText": "Niacet Corporation(Niacet) began as a semi-commercial chemical plant based on acetylene in 1924. The company is a privately owned corporation with approx. 80 employees. The facility operates 24 hours a day 365 days a year. The facility occupies 19 acres in a commercial/industrial area. The Niacet facility along with several surrounding companies were all once owned by Union Carbide Corporation( DOW). The facility is bordered by Niagara Falls Blvd. to the north, 47th street to the west, Simmons ave. to the south, and a Praxair facility to the east. The nearest residential area is approx 0.5 miles to the NW.\n\nNiacet is a major producer of metal organic acid salts such as calcium propionate,sodium acetate, and sodium phenoxyacetate (SPA) which is used in the fermentation of penicillin. Niacet produces monochloroacetic acid which is used to manufacture SPA, and is also sold on the merchant market. Chlorine is used to make monochloroacetic acid. Ethyl ether is used in the manufacture of SPA and also several anionic surfactants.\nChlorine is received via railcar and transferred through a vaporizer into one of two reactors for the production of monochloroacetic acid. Niacet can have up to two railcars on site for a total of 360,000 lbs. Safety systems include chlorine sensors, automatic shutoff valves, and video monitors.\nEthyl ether is received via tank truck, and stored in one of two 14,000 gallon storage tanks. In total the two tanks can store up to approximately 170,000 lbs. Ethyl ether is used in the manufacture of SPA, and anionic surfactants. The ethyl ether is a processing aid which is recycled and reused in these processes. Safety systems include hest sensors that activate a deluge system, and LEL air monitors/alarms. Niacet has a management system in place to oversee the implementation of the RMP program elements. The Manager, Quality Assurance & Regulatory Affairs has overall responsibility for the development,implementation,and integration of the RMP program ele"

      "SummaryText": "ments. The Manager,Quality Assurance & Regulatory Affairs reports directly to the co-Managing Directors. He may assign responsibility of individual elements to qualified employees identified in the Niacet organizational chart. Niacet is committed to operate our Niagara Falls, Ny facility in a safe and responsible manner. Our long history of no off-site releases of regulated chemicals speaks for itself. The is due to the layers of safeguards in place to prevent the release of hazardous substances. In the unlikely event of a chemical release, comprehensive emergency response plans are in place to bring any situation to a safe resolution. Niacet regularly meets with emergency responders, and conducts on-going training of employees, and off site responders to be prepared in the unlikely event of an emergency situation.\n\nAccident prevention is a key element of our RMP plan. We take a systematic/proactive approach to preventing the accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Niacet's RMP plan includes the adoption of OSHA's accidental release prevention program. Some key elements include: Operating procedures,Process safety information,Process Hazards Analysis,Training, Mechanical Integrity,Incident Investigation,Compliance Audits, Management of Change, Contractor Management, Pre-startup Review, and Employee Participation.\nContinual improvement is key to our success. This includes our joint Union/Management safety committee, review of plant procedures, near misses, incident investigation programs, solicitation of suggestions, and the maintenance of scheduled comprehensive safety meetings."
