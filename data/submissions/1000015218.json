The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is operated for the Town of Clarksville under contract with American Water Operations and Maintenance, Inc., (AWO&M). The Town of Clarksville WWTP has developed a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the control of catastrophic releases of extremely hazardous substances at the WWTP. The RMP builds on the commitment for both the Town of Clarksville and AWO&M for the protection of its neighbors, its employees and the control of the potential for such releases. The WWTP uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide for chlorination and de-chlorination of wastewater prior to discharge through an NPDES Permit under the Clean Water Act. The EPA threshold quantity for sulfur dioxide is 5,000 pounds. The facility stores less than 5,000 pounds (lbs) or no more than two (2) one (1) ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide onsite. The threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 lbs. The WWTP stores greater than 2,500 lbs of chlorine onsite or no more than two (2) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine onsite at anyone time. \n\nThe Town of Clarksville WWTP uses chlorine stored in 2000 lb, (one ton) pressurized steel cylinders for disinfection of wastewater. Two (2) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine are connected by a manifold into the process. Chlorine is delivered to the WWTP on an as need basis. Although the chlorine exists as a liquid under pressure inside the cylinders, it is passed into the disinfection process as a gas through a series of pipes and valves at near ambient temperature and pressure until it is injected into the liquid wastewater process stream. The WWTP has a chlorine leak detection system linked to an audible and visual alarm and ventilation system in an enclosed Chlorine Charging Room.\n\nThe RMP summarizes e"

The RMP addresses AWO&M management procedures, hazard assessments, prevention programs, emergency and emergency response measures that are consistent with 40 VFR Part 68 Chemical Accident prevention Provisions. The primary person or operator responsible for the implementation of the RMP is the AWO&M, plant manger. \n\nAWO&M conducted an analysis of chlorine release potentials at the WWTP. This analysis presents results of the worst case release scenario as required by 40 CFR 68.25 and an alternative case release scenario as required by 40 CFR 68.28 and public receptors potentially affected by each scenario. Over the past five years there have been no releases meeting the provisions of 40 CFR 68.42(a) at the Town of Clarksville WWTP. \n\nThe Town of Clarksville WWTP has developed a comprehensive prevention program that complies with the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationA?s (OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations 29 CFR 1910.119. The prevention program requirements of EPAA?s RMP rule are also satisfied by this PSM program. The following sections describe some of the elements of our prevention program that address the RMP rule requirements. Employee Participation, Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Contractor Safety, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Mechanical Integrity, Hot Work, Management of Change, Incident investigation, Emergency Planning and Response and Compliance Audits.   \n\n\nEmployee Participation A? The Town of Clarksville WWTP has a written employee participation program for our covered process to help ensure that the safety concerns of our employees are addressed.

The Town of Clarksville WWTP maintains a variety of technical documents, including an emergency preparedness plan to help ensure that our employees and local emergency responders know about the hazards associated with chlorine at the plant. These documents address physical properties of chlorine, operating parameters of the equipment and the design. We ensure that this process safety information is available to our employees.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis A? A process hazard analysis was conducted of the chlorine charging process. The process hazard analysis team consisted of AWO&M personnel knowledgeable in process operations, maintenance and process hazard analysis. The process hazard analysis team used the A?what-if / checklistA? technique and the recommendations that were identified through the process were implemented. \n\nOperating Procedures A? AWO&M employees have worked together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to working with chlorine should be done safely. The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides when performing normal operations and reacting to process upsets. These operating procedures serve to define operating limits and consequences during process deviations. The procedures provide safety and health information such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements and actions to be taken if exposure to chlorine occurs.\n\nMechanical Integrity A? We maintain our process equipment to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public and or the environment. Our mechanical integrity; preventive maintenance program includes inspections and equipment testing that is performed by equipment contactors and our maintenance staff to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails. We ensure that new and replacemen"

In the event of a chlorine release the Town of Clarksville WWTP has an Emergency Response Plan that coordinates emergency response activities with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee (LEPC). If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the local fire department who would dispatch a trained Hazmat team to the site to handle the chlorine release. Personnel are responsible for initial notification of a release and for facility evacuation and accounting for WWTP employees in the event of a major chlorine release. \n\nTraining A? We train employee to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks. Our training program included both initial and refresher training that covers a general overview of the process, the properties and hazards of chlorine, a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral reviews and demonstrations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can begin work in a covered process area.\n\nHot Work Permit A? We reviewed OSHAA?s fire prevention and protection requirements and created a hot work permit form to comply with these requirements. Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the form, and the appropriate supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin. Training on hot work activities and on the requirements of the hot work permit program is included in our safe work practices.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review A? We perform safety reviews of new or modified processes before placing them into service to help ensure their safe operation. This review confirms that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications and  adequate safety, operating, maintenance, training and emergency procedures are in place.

All changes other than replacement-in-kind must be approved through the full management of change program. This helps ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, affected process safety information and procedures are updated and affected employees are notified of the changes.  \n\nCompliance Audits A? We have a program to perform compliance audits of our covered processes every three years to be performed by an audit team knowledgeable in the PSM and RMP regulations. The audit team evaluates the program elements to ensure that compliance achieved.\n\nWe continually work to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect our employees and the community we serve.
