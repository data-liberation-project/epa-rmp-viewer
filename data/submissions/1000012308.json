The site is located at 1741 West Beaver Street, City of Jacksonville, in Duval County, Florida.  The site is located in an area, boarded by Robinson Avenue on the west, Railroad Tracks on the east, McQuade Street on the north and West Beaver Street on the south.\n\tThe Plant includes a separate ammonia operation storage building and adjacent control room system.  The boundaries of the ammonia system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Ammonia Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent makeup and exhaust systems.  Ammonia is delivered to numerous refrigerator units and returns to the compressor room where it is liquefied for further use.  These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&ID) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).  All drawings are maintained in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.\n1.2.2.\tREGULATED SUBSTANCE  (b)(2)\n\t\tAnhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance on site which exceeds the EPA 40 CFR-68 rule 10,000 pound EPA and OSHA threshold quantity.  Beaver Street\u00c2\u00bfs ammonia process was installed as part of the process of supplying plant refrigeration.  It operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FL DEP).  The ammonia is stored in a receiver and distributed to the refrigerator process control systems. \n\tAnhydrous ammonia is an EPA listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Ammonia\u00c2\u00bfs formula is NH3.  The OSHA PEL is 50 ppm.  It is flammable and is a gas at standard conditions.  Ammonia is liquefied by compression.\n\t\n1.3.\tWORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS (c)\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two ammonia release scenarios.

The plant and support equipment of the ammonia compressor room and control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The building is equipped with ambient ventilation area.  It has a fan ventilation system, which is used during ammonia receiver charging operations.  The room is also equipped with an ammonia monitor and the system has an emergency shut down located in the adjacent control room.\n1.4.2.3.\tEquipment Design\nThere are two types of ammonia pipe systems, high pressure liquid supply lines and medium and low pressure vapor return lines.  The high pressure ammonia piping system is made of ammonia compatible steel pipes or equipment.  These materials are steel or ammonia compatible non-metallic compound (not corroded by ammonia) rated to 2,500 psig.  The typical pressure of the ammonia in the high pressure system is only 150 psig giving a substantive safety factor.  This system is extensive, leading from the ammonia compressor room to each of the individual refrigerator or freezer units.  \nThe medium and low pressure system operates under a positive pressure.  All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are also ammonia compatible.  Ammonia from the freezers returns at six psig and ammonia from the refrigeration units retunes at 20 psig.  The high pressure system is designed using schedule 80 seamless pipe and fittings designed 2,500 psig giving it a large safety factor over the typical positive pressure in the high pressure system. The low pressure system  uses schedule 40 pipe and fittings and is rated from 450 to 1.000 psig.  The low pressure system operates at 6 psig for freezer return lines and 20 psig for refrigeration return lines. There is an ammonia monitor which detects the presence of ammonia in the compressor room storage area.  \n1.5.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY  (e)\nThere have been zero EPA recorded accidents in the past five year"

Emergency response drills and drill evacuations are conducted by the operating department.  Emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed annually.\nThe emergency response program (contingency plan) is coordinated (reviewed by) with the Plant Wide Safety Committee, the Jacksonville Department (who man the nearby City Fire/Rescue Station).  The plant coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the City of Jacksonville Fire Department HazMat team.  All are located in Duval County, Florida.  Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments in the City of Jacksonville and Duval County.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the Beaver Street plant.\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to an ammonia spill (release).  The plan includes training of all ammonia-area operators.  The primary response team includes the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, plus the Haz Mat Team.  All of these respond to severe ammonia leak situations.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the City of Jacksonville Fire Rescue, Police and Duval County Emergency Management Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n1.6.1.\tPERSONNEL  (f)(1)\n\tPersonnel are the key resource of the Beaver Street Fisheries, Inc. prevention program.
