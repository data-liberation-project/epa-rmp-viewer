The regulated process located takes place in the on-site wastewater treatment facility, located in road 165, km 2.6, intersection 888 Industrial Bay View in Cata??o, Puerto Rico.  The primary objectives of this RMP includes: to prevent the accidental release into locations that could potentially expose employees and the community to serious hazards and to establish the emergency response procedures.   The key elements of this plan are: the review of the regulated substance and process; the evaluation of a worst-case and alternative release scenario; a review of a five-year accident history; a process hazard analysis systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.\n\nThe wastewater from the distillation and fermentation processes is treated on-site by the anaerobic digestion process. The biogas is a gas mixture produced during the anaerobic digestion process containing from 55% to 60% methane. The biogas generated on the digester is directed through the compressors to the sulfur removal plant where it is treated with a scrubbing solution before either burn it on the flare to control the emissions or use it as fuels on the boilers.   \n\nAccording to Chemical Safety Information, Site Security anf Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (January 6, 1999), the RMP requirements do not apply to flammable substances when used as fuel or held for sale as a fuel at a retail facility solely because because of the explosive or flammable properties of the substance, unless fire or explosion caused by substance result in acute adverse health effects from human exposure to the substance, including unburned fules or its combustion by-products, other than those caused by the heat of the fire or impact of the explosion. \n\nBacardi Corporation is currently re"

As part of this new production strategy, the Distillery will modify the operational mode, which includes extended shutdown periods of about three (3) months.   However, the mosto treatment plant still operation throughout the year generating biogas that will not be used as fuel on the boiler.  \n\nMethane is considered a regulated substance (flammable) under the Risk Management and Process Safety Programs. Characteristics of this gas include an odorless, colorless gas which poses a serious fire hazard when accidentally released.  As a gas it will act as a simple asphyxiant and present a significant health hazard by displacing the oxygen in the atmosphere.  It is lighter than air and may be spread long distances. \n\nA maximum of approximately twenty two thousand (22,000) pounds of biogas gas can be processed at one time at the facility. Each digester headspace contains about eleven thousand (11,000) pounds of biogas. The biogas equipment (digester, compressors, storage tanks, process vessels, flares, pumps, blowers, piping, safety devices and instrumentation) are located open to air.  The safety protection includes safety relief valves, flame arresters and pressure and temperature interlocks to shut off the system a part from the visual and audible alarms at the control room. \n\nBacardi provides training designed to inform all employees and contractor the hazards of biogas, the means to increase potential dangers, the procedures for safe operation and maintenance of equipment and the steps taken in case of an abnormal situation.  Bacardi has experienced and well trained operators that have worked extensively with the biogas system. Training of employees is well documented and implemented at the facility.\n\nBacardi has had no accidental releases of biogas in the past five years.\n\nThe employee participation program establishes the involvement of the employees during the risk assessments"

Equipment modifications or re-design are evaluated through the MOC program considering material compatibility, construction codes and standards, and safe work practices.   Periodic equipment integrity inspections and tests are performed to evaluate condition. \n\nBacardi has developed an emergency action plan in compliance with 40 CFR 68.90. The emergency action plan has coordinated all emergency response activities with the company Emergency Brigade, the City of Cata??o Police and Fire Department, and other pertinent authorities that will perform all HAZMAT activities at the facility. The emergency action plan establishes the procedures necessary to follow in case of a biogas release as well as the order of notification for off-site responders. Employees will receive the training required to recognize a methane release and to initiate the emergency action plan procedures by notifying the proper authorities. Emergency drills and evacuation drills are conducted periodically that simulate potential emergency conditions. \n"
