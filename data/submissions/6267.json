WICK, 316-397-5308\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n     THE OWNERS, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF WICK GRAIN COMPANY ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\n     -THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THIS FACILITY IS THE STORAGE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FOR SALE TO FARMERS.\n\n     -ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECT APPLICATION FOR CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENTS.\n\n     -THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 52,530 POUNDS IN OUR STORAGE TANK.\n\n3.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO.\n\n      A.  THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK RELEASED AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 52,530 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE LARGEST STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 2.6 MILES.\n\n      B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT IS 0.4 MILES.\n\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1\", PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC., AND THE STANDARDS OF THE US OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,  \"STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".\n\n5. THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n\n      THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASED OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT:\n     -HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATHS, INJURIE"
