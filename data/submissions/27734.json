The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed with the USEPA as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  This RMP is also being filed with the local Administering Agency, Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division, as required by California Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations, California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5.  The Risk Management Program originally filed for this facility is being revised to reflect a major reduction in chlorine inventory and elimination of a process using chlorine.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nCalifornia-American Water Co., Sacramento Division, provides water supply and distribution to a large portion of Sacramento County.  Its water treatment facility, Countryside WTP, "

      "SummaryText": "is located at 8230 Meadowhaven Drive, Sacramento, CA in Sacramento County, and stores 150-lb. cylinders of chlorine which are transported to other sites in the system for use.  Cylinders are received by truck and handled with a forklift and hand truck.  The quantity stored is greater than the Federal threshold quantity for this RS.  The facility is located in a residential neighborhood.  There are no full-time employees at this site.  Operators visit the site daily and also respond to alarm conditions.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of California-American Water Co.  that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of releases of chlorine to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, California-American Water Co. has gathered safety information on chlorine and on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency response program coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nA single \"worst case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum distance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on site above the threshold quantity.\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the contents of the largest container of chlorine on site"

The toxic endpoint reached a location off the property.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn \"alternative case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each toxic RS handled in quantities greater than the threshold quantity at the site.  The \"alternative case\" scenario is described in the ARP regulations as a likely release resulting in offsite effects, considering administrative controls and mitigation measures in place, and is to be determined by the facility operators as part of the Process Hazard Analysis required to be performed during RMP development.  The \"alternative case\" considered for this facility is the release of chlorine gas from a 150-lb. cylinder due to failure of a fusible plug, with the release secured by emergency responders applying a repair lit to the valve after 60 minutes.  The toxic endpoint reached a location off the property.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at California-American Water Co. which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include California-American Water Co.'s written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenario.  No passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the timely response of properly trained and equipped personnel following established emergency response procedures.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs insti"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for California-American Water Co.'s operations at this site.  The program and document management procedures included in the PSM Program are used as the management system for the Risk Management Program.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\n\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine have been identified and implemented.  These include, among other things, improving the seismic restraint system for 150-lb. cylinders stored at the facility, fabrication of a restraint system for a hand truck with cylinder on the transfer truck lift gate, and creation of delivery and transfer procedures with check boxes for completion of critical steps.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidents involving chlorine at this facility within the past five years resulting in injuries or offsite consequences.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia-American Water Co.'s Emergency Response Program applicable to chlorine has been coordinated with Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Materials Division and Sacramento City Fire Department's Hazardous Materials Incident Response Team.  It consists of First Response by properly trained and equipped Company personnel to assess the situation, rescue injured persons in the vicinity of the release, and perform defensive actions to slow or stop a release from a safe distance, notification of the public agency assigned responsibility for First Response to hazardous materials release emergencies, and evacuation of persons on site to designated assem"
