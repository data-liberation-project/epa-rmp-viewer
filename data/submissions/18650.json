Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Suburban Propane - Phoenix are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass LP Gas Distribution - Wholesale.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Propane.  Propane is stored on site pending wholesale transfer.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from LP Gas Storage.  In this scenario 126000 lb. of Propane is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 80 % of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.40 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternativ"

The scenario involves the release of 129.76 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is <0.06 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from LP Gas Storage.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Fire.  The scenario involves the release of 2400.00 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of Lower flammability limit is <0.06 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA 58 and building codes in effect at time of construction.The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nSuburban Propane - Phoenix maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with our process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 01/15/2000.\n\nO"
