All of us are responsible and accountable for adhering to the letter and spirit of this policy.  All of us must incorporate safety, health and environmental considerations into our daily business activities.  It takes a total team effort to truly be a Responsible Care company.\n\nThe Hattiesburg-Mississippi plant was origionally designed in the early 1920's to extract rosin and liquid terpenes from virgin pine stumps left from logging operations. Our rosin based operations produce materials primarily used in the adhesive industry and even in the production of chewing gum. Over the years the plant's production from our rosin based operations has declined. \n\nAlthough started back in the 1960's our paper-chemical based operations are the newest part of our plant. Our paper-chemical based operations produce materials primarily used in the paper manufacturing industry.  Our materials when used in the manufacture of paper towels and tissues gives varying strenght to these different type commercial paper products when wet. Other Hercules paper materials when used in the manufacture of commercial paper products give water resistance characteristics so that ink will stay on the paper.\n\nCurrently, three of our process chemicals, Epichlorohydrin, Ethylene Oxide, and Ammonia are regulated as a toxic chemical under the Risk Management Guideline. One chemical, Ethyl Ether, is regulate as a flammable chemical under the Risk Management Guideline.\n\nThe toxic chemical worst-case scenario at our facility is the catastrophic release of 145,000 lbs  of Ethylene Oxide from a full railroad tank car.
