U.S. Foods, Inc's safety and environmental policies are administered by the General Manager, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/CalARP/RMP Program.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe U.S. Foods, Inc facility is located at 2301 Chabot Court, Suite 102, Tracy, California. The facility is approximately 0.83 miles south of Interstate 205, and 0.91 miles north of Highway 205.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural respect to the surrounding area. The primary business of U.S. Foods, Inc is to provide processing and cold storage of frozen food products. In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system with an inventory exceeding the threshold quantity of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance. The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and cold storage of frozen food products. Typical operating conditions range from 1.3 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 172 psig on the high side.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe U.S. Foods, Inc ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facili"

The facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that vent to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe U.S. Foods, Inc facility is under construction and will be completed at the beginning of April 2018, thus there is no accident history to report.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe U.S. Foods, Inc facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. The facility has it's own emergency action plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for information the public and local response agencies of a chemical release. The emergency action plan also includes information on emergency health care. The facility coordinates ammonia release emergencies with Tracy Fire Station 92. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, conducted on November 8, 2017, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the U.S. Foods, Inc facility. The Systems Services of America safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\r\n1.) Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n2.) Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n3.)
