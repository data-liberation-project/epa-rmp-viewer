The facility is located on 40 developed acres on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids.  It is immediately bordered by 41st Avenue Drive; C Street SW; a fish-feeding operation; a neighboring power station property; and 40 undeveloped acres owned by GCI.  This ISO-9002-certified-facility employs 91 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.  In March of 1999, Genencor initiated an effort to implement an Environmental Health & Safety Management System for the site, guided by sustainable development principles.  This effort will continue through 1999.\n\nThe site manufactures enzymes through a fermentation-based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins, and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The sites enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has on-shift Maintenance and Laboratory support.  Staff support includes site Management, Environmental Health & Safety, Engineering, Purchasing, Finance, and Systems personnel.\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Average on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is 37,000 liters, equal to 21,887 pounds of ammonia content.  The ammonium hydroxide storage and delivery system is the covered process for the sites Risk Management efforts and is divided into the following sections or \"nodes\" for the purpose of this program:\n7 Truck Unloading (includes delivery truck and suction-side of unloading pump)\n7 Truck Unloading (includes discharge-side of unloading pump)\n7 Ammonium Hydroxide St"

All employees are trained in the site Emergency Action Plan as part of the established initial safety training for new employees.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan also introduces the Emergency Response Team(\"ERT\") function and what that groups responsibilities are.  The ERT members are trained in Industrial Incipient Level Fire Brigade; Technical Level Industrial Chemical Spill Response; First Aid/Adult CPR; and Bloodborne Pathogens.  \nEach year, the Emergency Response Team establishes group goals for the year.  1999 ERT goals are as follows:\n7 Complete one drill per crew by designated quarter\n7 Complete 3 table-top scenarios\n7 Have injury-free responses to all incidents\n7 Attendance:  Have at least 50% attendance at all meetings so as not to have to postpone any meetings\n7 EPA Risk Management Program:  Review ammonia portion of facility Emergency Response Plan at Septembers ERT meeting\n7 Do an educational piece before each ERT meeting (September & December)\n-Propane informational video to be presented at September meeting\n\nThis group trains yearly as well as conducts drills and table-top scenarios to prepare for incident-handling.

This allowed both GCI and local fire department personnel to work together on an incident response and develop better ways of administering a joint incident response.  On-site ERT equipment is maintained to support the ERT efforts and includes SCBAs, Level B chemical resistant suits, chemical absorbent materials, pumps & hoses, and an equipment trailer for timely response to an incident.  \n\nThe site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release is in place to provide ERT guidance for spill operations.  The Incident Command System is the designated management system for emergencies and is included in the plan.  The plan outlines the responsibility of involved personnel during an incident; discusses the Incident Command System; gives instruction for securing outside emergency assistance; addresses internal and external notifications including the media/public; outlines emergency procedures for general emergency response; addresses spill control, personal protective equipment & first aid; and covers disposal & decontamination.  All ERT members are trained in the site Emergency Response Plan for a Hazardous Substance Release.  Incident response checklists and incident report forms are used by the GCI Incident Commander and involved personnel during incidents.\n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\nGCI prepared one worst-case and one alternative scenario for the ammonium hydroxide process.  EPAs Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis was used for completing both scenarios.  Passive mitigation is in place in the form of containment basins and was applied to both scenarios.  Administrative measures including high level alarms and tank level interlocks ensure that no more than 90% of the contents of the 49,000-liter-tank can be present on-site.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario starts with a rupture in the ammonium hydroxide storage tank.

Although there are no actual residences within the radius, Landview indicates 14 people within the identified 0.1-mile-radius area surrounding GCI.  Using the \"Block Group Centroid Method\" applied to the same radius, there were no census block group centroids found.\n\nA worst case release as described above is extremely unlikely due to a number of computer controls in place that would detect any leaks or level decrease beyond what the process calls for.  In addition, computer-controlled valves and pump operation would either interlock or be manually shut in the event of a leak or spill, which would lessen the amount of material spilled into the containment basin.\n \nAlternative-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe alternative-case scenario was chosen based on the results of the sites Process Hazard Analysis \"significant\" ratings for likelihood and severity of consequences.  The raw material truck unloading area showed a \"likelihood/severity rating\" of \"3\" for contamination due to the fact that the incoming ammonium hydroxide load is out of GCIs control until it arriv"

The frequency of unloading was also a consideration.\n\nThe scenario starts as a tanker truck filled with ammonium hydroxide (18,000 liters; 10,648 pounds of ammonia content) pulls onto the contained unloading pad to unload the material.  The coupling to the truck is attached and the program for off-loading has begun.  It is at this point that the coupling dislodges and aqueous ammonia is released.  The Genencor employee and the tanker driver are overcome by fumes and there is no one else in the immediate vicinity to shut off the emergency valve on the tanker.  Approximately 18,000 liters of the ammonium hydroxide solution is released to the containment pad surrounding the tanker truck. .  The pool is held within the truck unloading containment basin, which is considered as passive mitigation for the sake of the scenario.  Data regarding the scenario is as follows:\n7 The release rate of the spill, utilizing the containment basin to reduce the size of the pool, is 58 pounds per minute.  \n7 The distance-to-endpoint (from the spill outward) is 0.1 miles.  \n7 There are no environmental receptors within the spill radius.  \n7 The only public receptor that is in proximity of the radius is a commercial fish-feeding operation, located 0.2 miles from the facility.

These include, but are not limited to, an in-depth computer-tracked preventative maintenance program; standard operating procedures which are updated at least annually; employee training; back-up equipment where possible; and computer-monitored level indicators with interlocking systems when process limits are reached.  The facility has 24-hour team-based process coverage in the facility, including a full-service maintenance department.  The facility also operates under ISO 9002 certification which ensures among other things, that procedures are updated and used for plant operations in addition to proper handling of all documents.\n\nThe presence of an Emergency Response Team (as outlined earlier) ensures that all incidents are addressed immediately to prevent an escalation of the incident if possible.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at the Genencor International, Cedar Rapids facility involving the ammonium hydroxide system that resulted in any on-site or off-site effects.\n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis was conducted for the site ammonium hydroxide system in November, 1998.  This was led by an experienced outside consultant and completed by a team with members representing the Job #1 and Fermentation/Media Prep process areas; Maintenance; Engineering; site Management; Laboratory; and site Environmental Health & Safety.  Twelve recommendations for improvement were generated from the Process Hazard Analysis.
