      "SummaryText": "Part I     General Information\n\n\nCertco Inc is complying with the US EPA's risk management program, title 40 CFR part 68 (called RMP) and OSHA's process safety management, title 29 CFR 1910.119(called PSM) to deal with the risks involved with storage, handling, and use of hazardous chemicals\n\nBy complying with these rules, we promote plant, worker, and public safety. These programs help our facility to prevent the release of ammonia, which is our only chemical with potential for release to the atmosphere in the local community, as well as fires or other natural disasters. Overall these programs help prevent accidents, injuries, and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety program is applied to the ammonia refrigeration system to promote safe operation and help prevent accidental releases as well as all other aspects of our business operations including fork lift operator safety training, fire safety training and other generally accepted safety procedures applicable to food storage warehouses.\n\nOur operator/maintenance personnel receive specialized training in safe operating procedures for ammonia refrigeration and they have a combined total experience operating this system in excess of 70 years.\n\nAdditionally, we have an emergency off-site plan filed with the Dane County emergency planning commission, which is reviewed with them annually, and we work closely with the Fitchburg Fire Department on site to keep fire department personnel current and familiar with our operations.\n\nWe maintain special ammonia safety equipment at the facility and we also have an electronic ammonia leak detector system that is continuously monitored by our security contractor.\n\nThese policies and procedures help prevent accidents and protect our plant, our workers, and the public in our community.\n\nPart II     Facility Description & Chemical Process\n\nCertco Inc. is a wholesale grocery warehouse with a total area under roof of 285,000 Sq. Ft, Dry storage warehouse space is 207,000 Sq. Ft,"

      "SummaryText": " general office space is 21,000 Sq. Ft., and 37,000 Sq. Ft. of freezer space that is refrigerated by a central ammonia refrigeration system that was designed and constructed by nationally recognized ammonia refrigeration engineers and contractors.\nThis refrigeration process is located in the Southwest corner of \nthe facility It is comprised of four vessels, five low stage compressors,\nfour high stage compressors, and four liquid pumps, which are housed in the engine room on the second floor. There are six evaporators located in the freezer rooms and four evaporators located in two penthouses on the roof.\nThere are four evap-condensors also located on the roof. There are a variety of insulated pipes connecting all of the aforementioned components of this system.\n\nAll of the products stored in the freezers are consumer packaged general frozen foods. A Manning Model 20 Analgas ammonia leak detector with audible alarm protects the entire ammonia refrigeration process area. This alarm is continuously monitored by ADT Security Systems, who will notify one of three\npeople on a call list of a leak, who will be responsible for taking corrective actions.\n\nPart Ill    Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nFailure of the condenser return line to the high pressure receiver with a capacity of 3840 Lbs. limited to 50% or 1920 Lbs. by engineering operating design plus 4000 Lbs. From compressor discharge limited by total high stage compressor resulting in a ten minute release under worst case weather conditions (type F stability) per model RMP table 4-2 ammonia would travel (1.4 miles) to its toxic end point.\n\nThis scenario is unlikely because that type of weather is uncommon. The vessel and piping are made to industry standards for manufacture and quality control. Also, there are pressure relief safety devices installed on the vessel, daily maintenance and inspections are performed on the ammonia system, and the pipe and vessel are located out of harms way in the facility.\n\nPart IV     Alte"

      "SummaryText": "rnative Release Scenario\n\nFailure of a 1\" line off the high-pressure receiver resulting in a release of 5600 lbs. Over a 10-minute period under weather conditions (type D stability) per model RMP table 4-3 ammonia would travel .46 miles to it's toxic end point. This scenario Is unlikely because the pipe and vessel are located inside the engine room, so the release would be contained within the building They are protected from external damage, and are also part of the daily maintenance and inspection performed on the ammonia system.\n\nPart V     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nCertco uses the OSHA PSM CFR 29 1910.119 standard procedures to prevent accidental releases of ammonia. Written safe operating procedures and a maintenance and inspection checklist are used daily by our ammonia refrigeration trained staff of three people. The maintenance manager is a former board member and president of the local refrigeration engineers and technicians association (RETA) and has received 24-hr emergency training and continues to receive 8-hr refresher training. Two other ammonia maintenance personnel have 24-hr emergency training and continue to receive 8-hr refresher training as well.\n\n\nPart VI     5 Year Accidental Release History\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no releases from this facility.\n\nPart VII     Emergency Response Program\n\nCertco's emergency response starts with employees who are trained for emergency response. We have a written off-site plan coordinated with Dane County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) that is reviewed jointly on an annual basis. We also work closely with the Fitchburg fire department in conducting fire department personnel walk-through familiarization tours. We conduct periodical drills with the assistance of the fire department. There is also a list of names and phone numbers on who to contact in case of an ammonia spill that is posted throughout the plant.\n\nPart VIII     Planned Changes\n\nCurrent plans for changes inclu"
