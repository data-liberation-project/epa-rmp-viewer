(Reser's Pasco) industrial food manufacturing facility uses pure anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Given the quantity managed, anhydrous ammonia is considered a hazardous substance by the EPA. Anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant also requires that precautions and procedures be in place to protect employee, public health and safety during an unplanned event.  It is a Reser's Pasco policy to remain in compliance with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.    \n\n\n\n1.1.2.    Safety is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is managed. The design of the facility incorporates an array of safety devices and safe handling procedures combined with training of our personnel, are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\n\n\n\n1.1.3.    Reser's Pasco has a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with state and federal regulations. Reser's Pasco is not equipped to perform offensively during an unplanned event. An Emergency Action Plan was developed in accordance with the Emergency Response provisions and includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside agencies. This enables Reser's Pasco personnel and outside agencies to have a coordinated course of action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n\n\n1.2.    Facility Description And Substances Managed\n\n\n\n1.2.1.    Reser's Pasco is a food manufacturing facility that warehouses and distributes refrigerated foods. Refrigeration is a required process to preserve the integrity of processed foods. This refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees only. Unauthorized personnel, visitors and contractors shall be accompanied by trained and authorized personnel of the refrigeration team.\n\n\n\n1.2.2.    The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n1.2.3.    The"

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n\n\n1.3.1.    Release scenarios were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 2.01), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  Offsite receptors were defined using the Marplot Map Server.  This system was used to estimate the residential population within the circle defined by the endpoint of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  \n\n\n\n1.3.2.    Worst-Case Scenario.  Catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver located in the compressor room when filled to the greatest amount would release 15,557 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario presumes that the entire contents are released. \n\n\n\n1.3.3.    The distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case scenario is 1.7 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line, and would encompass an estimated population of 462.  \n\n\n\n1.3.4.    This worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature (e.g., earthquake) by physically compromising the tank. The structural integrity of the tank is safeguarded by periodic inspection for mechanical integrity to prevent a rupture due to tank degradation.  The tank is also safeguarded from rupture from over-pressurization.  It is a rated pressure vessel hydro-tested to 375 psi and equipped with 250 psi pressure relief valves. The design specification of the tank only allows a maximum capacity of 80% at 650&#61616;F, limiting the total amount of ammonia in the system.  During high demand, the High Pressure Receiver may only be filled to a fraction (~20%) of capacity.  In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling prog"

Several alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1\" opening in a high pressure liquid line.  Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  This scenario presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 18,080 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would result in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\n\n\n\n1.4.2.    The distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.6 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line, and would encompass an estimated population of 0 with the closest residence and schools inside the release zone. \n\n \n\n1.4.3.    The severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than ten minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves.  In addition, predominant winds are significantly stronger than input into the modeling program, helping to dispense the vapors more rapidly and effectively reducing the distance to toxic endpoint.\n\n\n\n1.5.

There have been no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage at the Reser's Pasco Washington facility.\n\n\n\n1.7.    Emergency Action Program\n\n\n\n1.7.1.    Reser's Pasco has a written Emergency Action Plan developed to ensure that precautions and procedures are in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical emergency.

The approach in the development of this plan has been to identify the ammonia emergencies most likely to occur at Reser's Pasco and establish precautions and procedures to protect life safety and health during an emergency.  The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.\n\n\n\n1.7.3.
