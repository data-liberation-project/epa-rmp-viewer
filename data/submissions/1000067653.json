Alternative scenarios could include an opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  This scenario presumes a release duration of 10 minutes resulting in a loss of 18,080 pounds of liquid ammonia.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would result in the highest potential exposure to offsite receptors.\r\n\r\n1.4.2.\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative scenario is 0.6 miles from the point of release.  This distance extends beyond the facility fence line, and would encompass an estimated population of 0 with the closest residence and schools inside the release zone. \r\n \r\n1.4.3.\tThe severity of release from this scenario would likely be less since safety system provisions are in place to limit the release duration to less than ten minutes through the use of appropriately placed isolation valves.
