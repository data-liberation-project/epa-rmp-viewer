      "SummaryText": "A. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co.'s emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees in evacuation and the handling of minor ammonia releases.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co.'s emergency response policy to major ammonia releases is to call the Yakima County ammonia response team.  This team is made up of area public safety responders and ammonia refrigeration personnel from area warehouses.\n\nAt Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. anhydrous ammonia is used on-site. Ammonia is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  \n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. is a fruit processing and cold storage facility, located at 300 N. Frontage Road, Wapato, WA.  The facility is located in Yakima County, on the Yakima Tribal Nation.  The plant property is fenced and Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. contracts with CWI security for 24-hour, on-site, security coverage.\n\nThe regulated substance used at Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. is anhydrous ammonia (CAS# 7664-41-7). The use of anhydrous ammonia is as a refrigerant.\n\nThere are 12,300 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two (2) single, independent refrigeration systems on the facility and is the only process subject to the RMP program.  The system with the greater amount of ammonia has 7,400 pounds in its inventory; the other has 4,900 pounds.\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. has established policies, procedures and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding areas.\n\n C. Worst-Case and Alternative Scenarios\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis considers two ammonia release scenario"

The worst case scenario is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released \".  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".\n\nWorst-Case Scenario. - Failure of the largest vessel in the system with the greater amount of ammonia would release the entire inventory of 7,400 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The release would occur inside the compressor room, which is in direct contact with the outside. Although for modeling purposes, no mitigation was taken into account.  Although building mitigation was not used, the building containment would be a substantial mitigation factor.  Modeling was done by use of RMP-COMP.\n\nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - For the alternative scenario, it was assumed that the system would loose its entire inventory through a 1 inch diameter short pipe (drain) at the bottom of the liquid receiver, without any mitigation.  Modeling was done by use of ALHOA (Aerial Location of Hazardous Atmospheres).\n\nThe distance to the EPA end-point is off-site\n\nBoth the \"worst-case\" and \"alternative\" scenarios are unlikely because Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. has employed the following control and mitigating measures.\n7 Industry standards and quality controls were followed in the design of this equipment and its manufacture.\n7 The facility insures only qualified personnel operate the system.\n7 The facility requires that all PSM elements as well as company maintenance policies are followed.\n7 The facility is located in Yakima County that has trained emergency response team to respond quickly to isolate and potential releases.\n7 Only trained and authorized personnel have access to the system.\n\nA more realistic scenario would be that of a pressure relief valve lifting, discharging ammonia vapor from ven"

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co.'s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n7 Preventative maintenance program\n7 Written safety procedures and safety equipment\n7 Use of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nInland-Joseph Fruit Co. also complies with: \n7 OSHA's and Washington State's process safety management rule.\n7 Applicable Washington State's safety regulations (WAC's 296-24 and 296-62).\n7 Applicable local fire codes.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was installed to applicable codes and good practices at the time of installation.  Piping is elevated to prevent accidental damage to the system from moving vehicles.  Engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety devices Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. utilizes include:\n7 Computerized controls\n7 High discharge pressure shut-down\n7 Low suction pressure shut-down\n7 Head water high discharge temperature shut-down\n7 Oil pressure failure shut-down\n7 Oil filter plugged shut-down on the screw compressor\n7 Check valves\n7 250 psi relief valves on the high pressure side, vented to atmosphere with 180 degree pipedown\n7 150 psi relief valves on the low pressure side, vented to atmosphere with 180 degree pipedown\n7 Personal protective equipment (PPE) - Air-purifying respirator, gloves and goggles\n\nOperating Procedures have been prepared by Inland-Joseph Fruit Co. to be used by employees performing operational functions.  The operating procedures are kept in the Refrigeration Supervisor's office.  These procedures include: \n7 Pre-start up procedures\n7 Routine operations\n7 Maintenance\n7 Response to minor releases\n7 Emergency action plan\n\nE.
