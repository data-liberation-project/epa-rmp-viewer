We use a combination of accident release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help insure the safety of our employees, the public and the environment.  We adhere to the DuPont Corporate philosophy of the ?goal is zero?.  This means that we constantly strive for zero process safety incidents, zero environmental incidents and zero injuries.  Our site safety, operating and emergency response procedures are available to all site employees thorough hard copies and/or electronic copies on computers throughout the plant.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe DuPont Fayetteville Works consists of approximately 2200 acres located on the Bladen ? Cumberland county line, adjacent to N.C. highway 87, approximately 15 miles southeast of Fayetteville, N.C.  Approximately 400 acres are currently used for manufacturing, with the remainder set-aside for future manufacturing needs.\nThe NAFION?, APFO, and TEDLAR? processes at Fayetteville are Prevention Program 3 processes.  The NAFION? process produces a membrane used in fuel cells and the Chloralkali industry.  In the production of those products, the following regulated substances are used as raw materials:\n- Hydrogen Chloride, anhydrous (received as an azeotropic mixture of TFE/HCl Distillate)\n- Tetrafluoroethylene (received as an azeotropic mixture of TFE/HCl Distillate)\n- Sulfur Trioxide.\nAPFO is a processing aid used in the TEFLON? polymer manufacturing process.  APFO is produced at Fayetteville and shipped to TEFLON? manufacturing sites.  To produce APFO, the regulated substance Oleum is used.\nTEDLAR? is a film product with multiple applications.  The polymer is produced at Fayetteville Works and shipped to other DuPont sites for final processing.  The regulated substance Vinyl Fluoride is used in the polymer manufacturing pro"

Our Process Safety Management system includes a documented process technology system detailing the hazards of the materials, equipment design basis and the process design basis.  Periodic Process Hazards Analyses are conducted to review the entire process to insure safe operation and compliance with design guidelines.  Materials of construction are strictly controlled to insure the mechanical integrity of the systems.  Extensive operating and safety instrumentation include alarms, interlocks and gas detectors allow the operators to continuously monitor and control the process conditions.  Process safety critical equipment and instruments are identified and routinely tested or inspected to insure proper operation and mechanical integrity.  A work order and permit system is used to control maintenance work.  Maintenance and operations personnel are trained and qualified via a rigorous training program.  Operating and maintenance procedures are documented and available to personnel either via hard copy or electronic copies on computers located throughout the operating areas. \n\n FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no on site injuries and no off site injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage due the accidental release of RMP regulated substances from the DuPont Fayetteville Works in the past 5 years. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe site has emergency response teams trained to respond to fire or hazmat emergencies.  Our emergency response program provides planning and training to effectively protect our employees, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  The emergency response procedures are in place and updated periodically.  All employees are training for their role in an emergency situation.

Every person on the site has a responsibility to improve the safety of our operations.  As part of our Process hazards Analysis process, teams consisting of operators, mechanics, technical engineers and management thoroughly examine and evaluate our manufacturing operations on a periodic frequency to identify risk reduction opportunities.  Audits, both first party and second party, are conducted using site based personnel and non-site personnel to evaluate compliance with safety, environmental, occupational health and process safety management requirements and regulations.  Findings are documented and tracked to closure."
