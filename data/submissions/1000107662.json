      "SummaryText": "ule lists the threshold quantity for aqueous ammonia at 20% concentration or greater to be 20,000 lbs. The aqueous ammonia vessel could store a maximum of 149,620 lbs. OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard specifies a threshold quantity for ammonia solutions greater than 44% by weight. Therefore, the facility is covered by the RMP Rule, and not covered by the PSM standard.\n\n\nThe characteristics and hazards of Ammonia are described in the following section (Section 1.2.3).\n1.2.3 Characteristics and Hazards of Ammonia and Safeguards Applied\n\nAqueous ammonia is a colorless alkaline liquid with a pungent odor. Although generally considered a weak base, aqueous ammonia reacts violently with most acids. It forms explosive compounds with mercury, silver oxide, and other compounds of silver. It corrodes many metals. With the halogens, it forms the shock-sensitive, explosive nitrogen trihalides. With household bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution) it forms toxic and explosively unstable chloramines. The concentration of ammonia in the air above solutions of aqueous ammonia can be within the explosive limits for ammonia (15\u009628%). \n\nAqueous ammonia is considered toxic to humans. Aqueous ammonia can cause severe skin burns and eye damage. Ammonia vapor may displace oxygen and cause rapid suffocation. Inhalation of ammonia vapor may cause respiratory irritation. \n\nTo reduce the risk of ammonia leaks at the Hot Spring site, a comprehensive safety strategy has been implemented. This strategy encompasses inherently safe design principles, pressure relief systems,  and thorough operator training. These measures are essential in maintaining safety and preventing ammonia-related incidents.\n\n1.2.4 Worst Case Scenario\nTo perform the offsite consequence analysis for the Hot Spring site, EPA\u0092s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) guidance was used to calculate the distance to an endpoint for the worst-case scenario (WCS). MARPLOT was used to overlay the impact area on a map and est"

Entergy is focused on providing best-in-class energy service with a focus on safety, teamwork, always learning, integrity, and respect.\nEntergy is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it operates.  Entergy\u0092s safety culture extends throughout the Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Program for the Entergy site.  As part of the safety culture,  Entergy affirms to employees, customers, and the community to conduct business with respect and care for the environment.  The safety, health, and environmental impact of any proposed modification at any Entergy site will be assessed to ensure that the site continues to operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  In addition, all Entergy sites will be prepared for emergencies to ensure that in the unlikely event of an accidental release, employees and visitors at the site as well as the surrounding community are unharmed and the environment is protected.  \n\n1.2\tDescription of the Hot Spring Site, Site Processes, and Prioritization of EHS\n\n1.2.1 Description of the Physical Site\nThe Hot Spring site address is 696 Black Branch Road, Malvern, AR, 72104. The facility is in Hot Springs County, Arkansas. The Hot Spring site is comprised of generally level terrain and is surrounded by dense forests. \n\nHighway access to the Hot Spring site is convenient over national highways, state routes and county roads.  Access to this site will be from Route 67. \n\n1.2.2 Description of Site Processes and Stationary Source\nThis site is an electrical power generating facility that utilizes aqueous ammonia at 29.5% solution in water. The aqueous ammonia is stored in a vessel onsite. EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan (RMP) r"
