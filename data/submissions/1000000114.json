FACILITY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY.\n\n      THE MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES OF SOUTHERN FS, INC  ARE COMMITTED TO \n      THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTIAL RELEASES OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTIAL\n      RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT.,\n      OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE \n      TO PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMWENT.\n\n2.   THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\n\n      THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY,  WICH IS LOCATED AT 1763 STATE HIGHWAY 14   MULKEYTOWN, IL,  IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO FARMERS.  ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR DIRECTAPPLICATION AS A CROP PRODUCTION NUTRIENT.  THE STORAGE AND HANDLING SYSTEM CONSIST OF 2 STORAGE TANKS (44,000 GALLONS), LOADING RISERS, ASSOCIATED PLUMBING AND NURSE TANKS.  ACCESS TO THE SITE IS RESTRICTED TO AUTHORIZED FACILITY EMPLOYEES, AUTHORIZED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND AUTHORIZED CONTRACTORS.\n\n       THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA THAT CAN BE STORED WOULD BE 350,000\n       POUNDS, THIS INCLUDES ANHYDROUS AMMONIA  THAT COULD BE STORED IN NURSE TANKS. \n\n3.   THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n      \n     This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario. However since this is security sensitive information it has been withheld from this executive summary as required by EPA regulations.\n\n\n4.   THE ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.\n\n      THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION RULE AND WITH ALL\n      APPLICABLE STATE CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THIS FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE \n      PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS\n      AMMONIA,"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\nThe following is a list of accidental releases in the past five years that have occurred at this facility:\n      - We had an accidental release of 5 pounds of anhydrous ammonia on 5/22/2008. One employee was injured and taken to \n      emergency room for treatment and released. There were no injuries off site, no evacuations, no propety damage,\n      no environmental damage or sheltering in place.\n\n6.   THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n\n      THE FACILITY HAS ...
