Anhydrous ammonia is listed as a regulated toxic substance in Federal Regulations (40 CFR 68.130) with a threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs.  EPA requires facilities with threshold quantities or greater of a regulated substance to prepare and maintain a Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\nThe original system constructed in 1992, the Frick system, meets design specifications in ANSI/IIAR 2-1984, Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and ANSI/ASHRAE-15, 1989, Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration.  All pressure vessels are built according to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Section VIII, Division 1, 1989 Edition (with 1990b Addendum), Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Pressure Vessels (or later editions).  Refrigeration piping design and construction was in accordance with ASME B31.5, 1987, Refrigeration Piping code.  Electrical design and construction was performed in accordance with NFPA-70, 1987, National Electrical Code.\n\nThe system constructed in 2010, the Mycom system, meets design specifications in ANSI/IIAR 2-2008, Equipment, Design, and Installation of Closed-Circuit Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems and ANSI/ASHRAE-15, 2007, Safety Standard for Refrigerating Systems.

      "SummaryText": "In September of 2010 Ajinomoto completed the installation of a new ammonia refrigeration system to accommodate production freezing requirements of a new process line.  Ajinomoto now has two independent refrigeration systems.\n\nThe original ammonia refrigeration system (Frick system) has a maximum capacity of 18,500 lbs (at 5.69 lbs/gal).  This capacity is reduced by 20% to a maximum intended inventory of 14,800 lbs.  The new system, referred to as the Mycom system, has a maximum capacity of 6,900 lbs (at 5.69 lbs/gal).  This is reduced by 20% to a maximum intended inventory level of 5,500 lbs.  The total maximum intended inventory on-site of anhydrous ammonia is 21,700 lbs.  It is Ajinomoto's policy that no standby make-up inventory of anhydrous ammonia shall be stored on-site.\n\nThe Frick and Mycom refrigeration systems are located in separate, but adjoining, engine rooms and do not share any mechanical components.  They are operated independently and cannot be cross-connected.\n\n1.30  Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, were modeled using RMP*Comp (Version 1.07), a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and EPA.  40 CFR Part 68, Appendix A, provides a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l concentration level.  The distances to the toxic endpoint provided by RMP*Comp for the two scenarios noted were overlaid in MARPLOT (Version 4.1.1).  The Western Regional Climate Center (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/westwinddir.html) and the National Data Climate Center (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/mpp/wind1996.pdf) were consulted and provide historical prevailing wind data at Portland International Airport (PDX) of a east southeast (ESE) direction.  This prevailing wind and the toxic end points were used to determine the most probable area of influence in the event of"

This area encompasses a 45\u00c2\u00b0 arc at the toxic endpoint centered on 292\u00c2\u00b0 radian from the point of origin or release.\n\nWorst-Case\nThe worst-case scenario modeled the catastrophic failure (rupture) and total discharge of the largest single vessel in both the Frick and Mycom systems.  Catastrophic failure of the high pressure receiver located in the Frick engine room when filled to 80% of the maximum volume amount would release 14,800 pounds of liquid ammonia.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.5 miles which extends beyond the property boundary of Ajinomoto.  This scenario used the following assumptions:  duration of release of 10 minutes @ 814 lbs/min, outside air temperature of 77 \u00c2\u00b0F, wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour, rural surroundings (relatively flat, unobstructed terrain), and released in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.\n\nGeographic features included in the worst case scenario include the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, the Columbia River Slough, Smith and Bybee Lakes and park, and Kelley Point Park located within approximately 1 mile of the Ajinomoto Frozen Foods facility.  The area is predominantly an industrial use area with no public schools, hospitals, stadiums, or other large public gathering places.\n\nThis worst-case scenario would not likely occur unless an act of nature (e.g., earthquake) physically compromised the tank.   The structural integrity of the tank is safeguarded by periodic inspection for mechanical integrity to prevent a rupture due to tank degradation.  The tank is also safeguarded from rupture from over-pressurization.  It is a rated pressure vessel hydro-tested to 375 psi and equipped with 250 psi pressure relief valves. The design specification of the tank only allows a maximum capacity of 80% at 80 degrees Fahrenheit, limiting the total amount of ammonia in the system.\n\nAlternative Scenario\nThe alternative scenario mod"

Other mechanical components were designed and constructed in accordance with the Oregon Mechanical Specialty Code, 2007.\n\n1.10  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe physical property of anhydrous ammonia that makes it useful as a refrigerant is its low boiling point of -29\u00c2\u00b0F at atmospheric pressure.  However, anhydrous ammonia has other physical properties that require precautions and procedures to be followed to protect the environment and public health during a chemical emergency.  It is the policy of Ajinomoto to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations.\n\nSafety at Ajinomoto is inherent in the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled.  While the design of the facility incorporates multiple safety devices, safe handling procedures, maintaining mechanical integrity, and appropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to safety at our facility.\n\nA written Process Safety Management (PSM) program that complies with the regulations stipulated by 29 CFR 1910.119 (OAR \u00c2\u00a71910.119) is in place.  A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan, developed in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120 (OAR \u00c2\u00a71910.120).  The Emergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordination with outside parties to enable coordinated action to effectively deal with unplanned events.\n\n1.20  Facility Description and Substances Handled\n\nAjinomoto Frozen Foods is a frozen food manufacturing facility that processes, stores, and distributes frozen ready-to-eat foods.  Production requires the use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of processed foods.  This refrigeration process uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant.  Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia."

This represents a major break in a high pressure liquid line from the condensers and loss of the full charge of 14,800 lbs. of ammonia in the Frick system.  This scenario was selected because a release of this type would occur outdoors resulting in the highest potential exposure to off-site receptors.  Several other alternative scenarios can generate the equivalent of a 1 opening in a high pressure liquid line such as:  opening created by a valve sheared off, a large gasket leak, or a pressure relief valve release.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.0 miles which extends beyond the property boundary of Ajinomoto.  This scenario used the following assumptions:  duration of release of 10 minutes @ 1,410 lbs/min, outside air temperature of 77 \u00c2\u00b0F, wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour, rural surroundings (relatively flat, unobstructed terrain), and released in an enclosed space in direct contact with outside air.\n\nGeographic features included in the alternative case scenario include the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, the Columbia River Slough, and Smith and Bybee Lakes and park located within approximately \u00c2\u00bd mile of the Ajinomoto Frozen Foods facility.

The refrigeration process has back-up prevention systems to keep processing malfunctions from becoming ammonia release emergencies.  If an emergency does occur, the following response personnel, facilities, and equipment are in place:  incident command center, emergency alarm and communication system, safe rooms, evacuation plans and assembly points, and personal protective equipment.\n\nIt is the policy of Ajinomoto Frozen Foods that employees shall not take offensive counter-measures to control or contain an uncontrolled or major ammonia release.  These situations are emergencies and employees shall only take the following actions: 1) identify a release, 2) notify plant supervisory personnel, 3) evacuate as directed, and 4) isolate or contain the release from an uncontaminated or safe location.  Only in the event of a minor release (e.g. small valve packing leak, draining of compressor oil, or maintenance tasks) shall Ajinomoto employees enter a contaminated area.  These situations are not classified as emergencies.  Vapor level concentrations shall be monitored and respirators with ammonia cartridges shall be worn.  No entry shall be permitted to the area with concentration levels above 300 ppm.\n \nThe role and procedures for obtaining external emergency assistance have been formally established with the Portland Fire and Rescue, including the Portland HazMat Team 6.  Portland Fire and Rescue and Ajinomoto shall notify any potential off-site receptors.\n\nAll Ajinomoto Frozen Foods personnel are trained to f"

Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify plan elements requiring improvement.\n\nThis plan shall be reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\n1.70  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAny upgrades or extensive maintenance work performed in the future will be in compliance with codes and standards applicable at that time.  The 2010 expansion of the refrigeration system with the addition of the Mycom system incorporated revised codes and standards that improve overall safety and reduce the potential for an off-site release.  Among these changes is the routing of pressure relief vent piping to a water diffusion tank.  Anhydrous ammonia has a very strong affinity for and readily dissolves in water.  At 68\u00c2\u00b0F, about 700 volumes of vapor can be dissolved in one volume of water to make a solution containing 34 percent ammonia by weight.  This solution of ammonia in water is called ammonium hydroxide or aqueous ammonia which minimizes vapor releases to the surrounding environment.\n\nAll Ajinomoto Frozen Foods personnel are trained to fulfill their designated responsibilities in an emergency.  Mock emergency drills are held periodically to maintain familiarity with response actions and identify elements requiring improvement.\n\nThe most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the Frick system was performed in January 2007 and for the Mycom system in September 2010.  Priority Lists of Recommendations was compiled for implementation for each system."
