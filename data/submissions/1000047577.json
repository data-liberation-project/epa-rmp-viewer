(\"Honda\") has developed and implemented two policies which directly impact and\n\ninfluence Honda's accident release prevention and emergency response activities. First, Honda's Safety Policy\n\nexpresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n\n\n?    provide a safe and healthful working environment,\n\n?    conduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety,\n\n?    continually improve the safety management system,\n\n?    train associates in respects to safety related to their job, and\n\n?    comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by federal, state, and local law,\n\n\n\nSecond, Honda has developed and implemented an Environmental Policy which expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n?    comply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, and local law,\n\n?    operate and continually improve an environmental management system, and\n\n?    implement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce waste.\n\n\n\nWith these policies as a foundation, Honda's Anna Engine Plant (Honda AEP) has made a significant effort to ensure\n\ncompliance and good management in all areas relating to chemical safety. Many of the Risk Management Program\n\n(RMP) requirements are similar or identical to requirements covered by the Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the two Honda processes subject to RMP\n\nregulation are also subject to PSM requirements. Moreover, even before the OSHA PSM standard was adopted as\n\nfinal rule, Honda AEP maintained a high level of protection from potential chemical exposures for all Honda AEP\n\nassociates. This was accomplished through: operational controls, systems design, mechanical integrity and associate\n\ntraining. Honda AEP procedures meet all applicable PSM "

In many respects, procedures to prevent or\n\ncontrol unwanted releases at Honda AEP currently exceed PSM requirements relative to mechanical integrity and\n\nassociate training. For example, Honda AEP uses fixed head monitoring devices to detect leaks and/or releases,\n\nuses grade-specified components, replaces hardware prior to manufacturer-suggested replacement intervals, and has implemented comprehensive associate training.\n\n\n\nA Brief Description of the Honda AEP Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nHonda AEP primarily consists of six manufacturing departments:\n\n\n\n1. Aluminum Die Cast Department.\n\n\n\nIn the Aluminum Die Cast Department, raw aluminum ingots are melted in aluminum furnaces. The molten aluminum\n\nis then injected into dies either by low-pressure casting or by high-pressure casting. Low pressure casting is used to\n\nproduce engine cylinder heads. High pressure casting is used to produce engine blocks and transmission casings.\n\n\n\n2. Aluminum Machining Department.\n\n\n\nEngine blocks and cylinder heads from the Aluminum Die Cast Department are machined into finished products for\n\nuse in the Engine Assembly Department.\n\n\n\n3. Engine Assembly Department\n\n\n\nThe Engine Assembly Department consists of three assembly lines.\n\n\n\n4. Ferrous Manufacturing Department.\n\n\n\nIn the Ferrous Manufacturing Department, metal is melted in a cupola and poured into molds to form engine\n\nparts. In the Quick Cast Camshaft furnace, iron is melted and poured into an alloy die to make camshafts.\n\nThe parts poured are machined into finished products.\n\nCrankshafts are also machined and heat-treated. Anhydrous ammonia, regulated substances, are used\n\nin the heat-treating (nitriding) furnace to chemically harden the surface of the crankshafts.\n\n\n\n6. Drivetrain Manufacturing Department.\n\nIn the Drivetrain Manufacturing Department, transmission components are machined and heat treated.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia Process:\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia (metallurgical grade) is s"

The volume of ammonia\n\nin the tank is limited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Ammonia Safety Code, to 15,300-galions,\n\nto allow for vapor space in the tank. The process uses ammonia vapor, which is supplied from the headspace of the\n\ntank. If additional vapor is needed, ammonia is passed through a series of immersion heaters (vaporizers) where the\n\nliquid is vaporized into a gas. Through overhead piping, the ammonia vapor travels through a shutoff header stand\n\nand a flow meter stand prior to being introduced into the nitriding furnace.\n\n\n\nDue to the high temperature (1,110 degrees Fahrenheit) the ammonia dissociates into its components according to\n\nthe following reaction:\n\n\n\n2 Anhydrous Ammonia -> 2 Nitrogen + 3 Hydrogen\n\n\n\nThe nitrogen combines with the alloying elements in the steel to form nitrides. The nitrides form at the steel surface as a hard chemical layer which will minimize wear and fatigue. The remaining component, Hydrogen, (3H2) is burned off by the afterburner.\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps at Honda AEP:\n\nIn addition to being subject to the RMP requirements, HONDA AEP is subject to and complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard to prevent accidental chemical releases from the disk core manufacturing process and the operation of the nitriding furnace. HONDA AEP surpasses the requirements of various elements of the standard, including response training, mechanical integrity and chemical-monitoring devices to maintain high levels of compliance and prevent accidental releases. Monitoring systems have built in back up systems to insure fail-safe operation/detection and therefore are highly reliable. The plant also exceeds training requirements and has appropriate material/equipment to control or stabilize process leaks and releases.

This plan describes the responsibility and procedures of Honda\n\npersonnel and establishes a system in which the members of each plant's emergency response team work with local\n\nemergency response organizations. This company-wide plan also serves as a model upon which the Honda/AEP\n\nemergency response team has based its own Honda AEP-specific ERP. The Honda AEP plan outlines how the\n\nHonda AEP emergency response team is to work closely with the Anna Fire Department, the Shelby County Hazmat\n\nTeam, and the Emergency Management Agency to promptly respond to any emergency.\n\nThe Honda AEP Emergency Response Team (ERT) meets annually with the Village of Anna Fire Chief and members\n\nof its response team to review operations at the plant.
