Chlorine is stored at the site in a quantity greater than the 2,500 pound threshold established by the Clean Air Act, 40 CFR Part 68.  The purpose this Risk Management Program and Accident Prevention Plan is to: \n\u00b7 Reduce the potential of an accidental release of chlorine.\n\u00b7 Minimize the impacts should a release occur.\n\u00b7 Comply with requirements of the Clean Air, 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants, prepared by the American Water Works Association provides the basis for this Risk Management Program (RMP). The chlorine storage and handling operation at the Micron pumping station has been determined to be a Program Two process.  The results of an off-site Hazard Assessment showed that public receptors would be impacted during a \"worst-case\" release of chlorine.  The facility is not subject to OSHA's process safety management plan rule and does not operate under one of the SIC codes listed in 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). \n\nAn RMP Program Two Accident Prevention Plan was prepared with information on management responsibilities, safety information on the chlorine process, results of a hazard assessment, written operating and maintenance procedures and descriptions of operator training, compliance audit and incident investigation procedures.\n\nSAWS has determined that it will rely on the San Antonio Fire Department emergency response team to coordinate off-site activities in the event of a significant release of chlorine.  SAWS has an emergency response program to train employees to identify the source of the chlorine leak and to implement emergency notification procedures.  SAWS is a member of the Bexar County Local Emergency Planning Committee and works with the San Anto"
