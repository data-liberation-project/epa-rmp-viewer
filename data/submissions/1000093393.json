ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nThe Sealed Air plant at Madera has implemented an accidental release prevention policy which integrates hydrocarbon sensors, redundant safety systems, operational procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the EPA and OSHA are adhered to. The Madera plant Emergency Response Policy involves site specific plans which are detailed in the Emergency Response Plan and coordinated with the local fire department. \r\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLING:\r\nThe Madera manufacturers plastic foam packaging, and uses Propane and Isobutane as blowing agents to make plastic foam. These are the only regulated substances in threshold quantities at this location. Propane and Isobutane are flammable hydrocarbons held under pressure to maintain liquid form, but are released from the product during manufacturing as a gas. This gas is captured and send to an oxidizer as a means of emission control.\r\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS:\r\nWorst-case release scenario is defined in the OCA and is the failure of the largest tank when full, vapors finding an ignition source, and 10% of the release explodes. The plant is located in an industrial park.\r\nThe alternative release scenario or more credible scenario is based on the catastrophic failure of the 2 delivery piping. This breach allows a 30 second leak before the excess flow valves seal off the flow. The impact distance in both cased has been derived using EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document.\r\n4. SEALED AIR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\r\n*Risks and hazards for propane and isobutane are so much alike no distinction is made.\r\n*PSM Process - completed WHAT IF review of all stages of process.\r\n*System of hydrocarbon sensors at critical points of storage, piping, and manufacturing to identify releases.\r\n*Staged alarm and automatic process shutdown by hydr"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nNo accidental releases in the past 5 years\r\n6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nAll employees trained on emergency action plan including alarm response and building evacuation. The emergency response team is trained for all emergencies including leaks and incipient fire fighting. Fire alarm system will automatically summons the local fire department, shut down the process, and shut off the gas supply. Pre-planning conducted with local fire department. Emergency operation and response reviewed on an annual basis.\r\n7. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPORVE SAFETY:\r\nNumerous changes to improve safety, reduce risks, and prevent releases have come about because of the Process Hazard Analysis, Hydrocarbon Safety Program, annual emergency procedures review, root cause incident investigations, wisdom from other facilities, internal audits, and annual fire department visits. As part of Sealed Air's commitment to safety, periodic review and update is an on going process."
