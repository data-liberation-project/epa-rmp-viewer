The raw materials used in the production of foam are all liquids and are transported to the facility by truck and rail car. The raw materials are stored on-site in bulk tanks ranging in size up to 12,000 gallons, or in drums or totes. The liquid raw materials, through the use of a series of tanks and high pressure pumps, are mixed together and injected between a facer material. Once all of the liquids are combined together in the desired proportions, they react to form a foam. Following the injection, the foam passes through a laminator heater that further solidifies and hardens the foam. Following the laminator, the foam is cut to the desired width and length, stacked, and packaged for shipment. The foam insulation products, once packaged, are typically stored on-site for a short time, prior to their shipment to Rmax Operating, LLC's customers.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nIn its manufacturing process, Rmax Operating, LLC has the ability to use a flammable hydrocarbon, which contains Pentane (CAS # 109-66-0), as a blowing agent. Pentane is a substance that is regulated by the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Rmax Operating, LLC maintains a supply of this hydrocarbon blowing agent in a 12,000 gallon bulk storage tank, located on-site, for use in its manufacturing process.\n\nPrevention of Accidents / Accidental Releases\n\nPrevention of accidents / accidental releases at the facility is accomplished through not only compliance with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention provisions and other Federal and State regulations (including OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals requirements), but through application of Rmax Operating, LLC's cor"

Employee training and employee involvement are important components of its accident / accidental release prevention programs. \n\nSafe work practices are documented through the development and implementation of written operating procedures for production and maintenance personnel. Employee training is comprehensive, focusing on proper procedures for job specific routine and non-routine tasks, as well as providing an overview and awareness of the components of Rmax Operating, LLC's Risk Management Plan. Training is provided by a competent, experienced person.\n\nPreventive maintenance programs focus on inspection and/or testing of all process components including tanks, piping, pumps, valves, controls, instruments, and safety systems. In addition to helping ensure safe and reliable operation by maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process equipment, the results of this program are used to identify opportunities for system improvement. \n\nNumerous safety systems and controls have been incorporated into Rmax Operating, LLC's manufacturing process. These include redundant pressure regulators and pressure relief devices, excess and insufficient flow detection and shutoff devices, a gas detection and monitoring system, several ventilation systems, a fire suppression system, and control of potential electrical ignition sources. A variety of sensors and interlocks provide process control and rapid, automatic response to releases or threats of releases, These responses include increased process/building ventilation, raw material feed shutoff, process shutdown, and activation of facility evacuation alarms.\n\nRmax Operating, LLC has implemented a Management of Change program that requires a very detailed safety assessment and management approval for any significant change to equipment, safety systems, and/or operating procedures"
