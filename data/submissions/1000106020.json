Our safety strategy revolves around our Do It Right value and permeates our business in three key ways:\n\u2022\tRobust systems that provide a clear, repeatable direction toward excellence.\n\u2022\tSuperior performance that aligns effective and efficient EHS activities with operations.\n\u2022\tEngaged culture that empowers consistent behaviors that drive toward excellence.\nCF Industries works closely with emergency responders and other local officials to develop detailed emergency response plans that extend beyond our physical operating locations.\n\nDonaldsonville Nitrogen Complex and the regulated substances handled\nDonaldsonville Nitrogen Complex manufactures ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, and diesel exhaust fluid. Intermediates in the manufacture of these products include non-isolated ammonium nitrate and hydrogen. The regulated substances, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, which are present at the facility in more than a threshold quantity are ammonia and flammable gas mixtures \u2013 synthesis gas and natural gas.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\nThe Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release and chemical-specific prevention requirements set forth in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 40 CFR Part 68 and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality LAC 33:III.Chapter 59. This facility is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.
