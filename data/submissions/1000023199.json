Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen and steam.  Hydrogen in the amount handled by our facility are considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAAA?s HAZWOPER and Fire Brigade regulations.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the request of support through Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders if necessary. \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAAA?s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen and steam.  Natural gas is received by our facility via pipeline and used as feedstock.  The feedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace.  By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,600 degrees F) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.  The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then separated from the hydrogen in a Pressure-Swing Adsorption (PSA) system.  The pure hyd"

The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHAAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThere has been one accident involving accidental releases of flammable gas that resulted in property damage on site.  There were no injuries or sheltering in place required from this incident. There was no offsite impact.\n\n5.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facilitys emergency response program is based upon OSHAs HAZWOPER standards.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response.  They have been trained to OSHAs first responder awareness level. The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the site emergency plan. In addition, emergency response activities are also coordinated with Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA). Evacuation Drills are conducted periodically.\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs) and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures. \n"
