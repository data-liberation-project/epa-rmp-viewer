      "SummaryText": "e 1923.  The Savannah plant is a manufacture of chemical additives to the pulp and paper industry.  For example, epichlorohydrin is used in the production of wet strength resins.  These resins are used in paper towels, napkins, tissues, etc, so that they hold their strength when they get wet.  Epichlorohydrin is a raw material for the process and is consumed in the chemical reaction to make the product.  The plant receives epichlorohydrin primarily in railroad tank cars and occasionally in tank trucks and isocontainers.  The epichlorohydrin is stored in a single 279,000 pound capacity tank within a containment dike which has adequate capacity to hold 110% of the volume of the tank. The railcar unloading area also drains into the tank containment dike.  A nitrogen blanket of 4 inches is maintained in the storage tank dike to reduce the potential for release of epichlorohydrin vapors in the event of a spill or leak into the dike.  \n\n\n\nAccident Prevention\n\nThe Solenis-Savannah facility complies with the OSHA PSM rule.  As a PSM facility, Solenis completes a detailed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) every 5 years.  The PHA seeks to identify and address potential causes of incidents before they occur.  In addition, PSM training on safe handling of equipment and chemicals is conducted every three years for all Kymene area operators and all maintenance mechanics.  Management of Change (MOC) procedures are followed to ensure that any changes that occur in the Kymene process do not have the potential to result in an increased risk of a safety incident or an accidental release. In addition, routine maintenance is conducted under the facility's preventative maintenance program to ensure that equipment critical to the safe handling of epichlorohydrin is maintained in good condition at all times. System interlocks ensure that incompatible chemicals are never mixed together.  Leak detection monitoring is performed quarterly and scheduled mechanical integrity testing is performed on "

All plant employees are trained in how to respond small spills and releases in their area and how to report a spill or release.  Due to our small work force, we rely on emergency response contractors for the containment and clean up of significant spills of hazardous chemicals. Annual evacuation drills are conducted to ensure employees are familiar with emergency response procedures. Additionally all employees are trained at the 8 hour HAZWOPER level.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident history \n\nIn the last 5 years, Solenis has not had an incident involving epichlorohydrin.  The last incident occurred October 2012, where we experienced one incident where there was a leak in the Kymene heat changer.   The investigation revealed a 3-5 gallon mixture of polymer, water, and epichlorohydrin leaked from the between the plates of the exchanger.  The mixture contained approximately .5 gallons (<10 lbs) of epichlorohydrin.  The leak was stopped and the process cooling continued.   No regulatory thresholds were exceeded.  The leak was found to be caused by a build up of Kymene product that created a pressure build up in the heat exchanger.  The spilled material was contained and disposed of properly.   There have been no safety incidents involving the handling of epichlorohydrin.  \n\n\n\nChanges to improve safety\n\nSolenis -Savannah completed security upgrades in 2009 by adding 9 additional cameras for surveillance of hazardous material unloading areas, perimeter gate access points, and the plant's wastewater discharge basin.   The entire facility perimeter fencing contains razor wire and the facility continues to check for valid identification of all truck drivers, visitors and contractors before granting access into the facility.

Security background checks are also conducted for new employees and monthly security inspections of the plant grounds are conducted. Intruder security tests are also performed to identify possible deficiencies in the plant's security procedures.  All visitors and contractors are required to show valid government issued identification to gain access into the facility.\n\n\n\nIn 2010 a plantwide early warning notification system was installed at the center of the plant to alert plant personnel of an epichlorohydrin release at the storage tank.  \n\n\n\nIn 2010, emergency stops were installed to shut off the epichlorohydrin railcar unloading pump and the diethylenetriamine tank truck unloading pump.  These emergency stops were installed at remote locations to prevent personnel from entering into hazardous environments to perform emergency response actions.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, DOW chemical, the manufacturer of epichlorohydrin, performed a product stewardship visit to review the facility's handling of epichlorohydrin.  This review included unloading procedures, PPE, and best practices.  No concerns were found.  A second product stewardship visit was conducted in 2014 with no deficiencies noted.\n\n"
