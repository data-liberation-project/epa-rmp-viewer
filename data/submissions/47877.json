Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Though unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are coordinated with the Albany Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational requirements is 48,100 pounds.\n\n3. The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA PSM Regulation under CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 reporting requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What-if Checklist. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are validated at regular intervals of every five years. Findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in"

Process equipment examined by these checks include pressures vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, compressors and pumps. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with special training in maintenance practices; furthermore, these personnel are given specialized training as needed. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change:\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and processes. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by modifications in process operations, are promptly made aware of and given training to deal with the modifications.\n\nPre-Startup Review:\n\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice.These reviews are "

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that has resulted or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading up to the incident, as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from recurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nOregon Freeze Dry, Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort. Company Emplyees are strongly urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information resulting from process hazard analysis in particular.\n\nContractors:\n\nOn occasion, Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is completed. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc. has the strict policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency notification and evacuation, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. 5-Year Accident History:\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents at this facility during the past 5 years.\n\n5.
