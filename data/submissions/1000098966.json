Ready Pac is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program.  This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration equipment at Ready Pac. \n\n\n\nIt is Ready Pac's policy to ensure that controls are in place to limit the risks of potential ammonia releases.  To accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established safety programs that enable plant personnel to: maximize safety performance, reduce risks of handling ammonia and other potentially hazardous substances, and prepare plant personnel to address emergency situations as they might arise.\n\n\n\nThe Ready Pac facility draws from decades of internal experience and expertise, as well as resources of our parent company, Bonduelle Fresh Americas, to ensure that the appropriate mitigation measures have been identified and are implemented.  The commitment to safety shows in the minimal accident history at the facility.\n\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the plant's safety program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with Cal-OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Acutely Hazardous Materials, CCR Title 8, Section 5189), and EPA's Risk Management Program regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68), as well as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program (CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735.1 - 2785.1).

It is located in southern Irwindale off of Irwindale Avenue.  It operates to produce and distribute salad and associated food products.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in the system that provides refrigeration for cold storage, chilling secondary refrigerants, and producing ice.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia is approximately 49,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program starts with good operating and manufacturing practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected on a regular schedule in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\n\n\n\nFor example, all compressors are routinely inspected for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motors and bearings, filter changes, vibration readings and sensor calibrations;  the condensers are inspected weekly (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers), motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  oil pots are drained (as needed), pump pressures are recorded and pumps and valves are defrosted for excessive ice build-up;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating limit conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, and other potential abnormalities on daily basis;  pressure relief valves are replaced on a five year frequency.  Ammonia leak detectors, which are calibrated semi-annually, trigger local audible and visual alarms for plant operators.  Machiner"

To help coordinate the various elements of the program, a management system has been established that defines responsible parties at the plant for each element of the facility's PSM / RMP program.  Compliance Audits are also conducted every 3 years that can identify potential compliance issues and recommend actions to achieve full compliance.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC), the County of Los Angeles Fire Department, and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.  The ultimate goal for Ready Pac's PSM/RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid physical damage to the environment.  These programs enable our facility to operate a refrigeration system safely because they are based on the rules, procedures, and guidelines that govern our network of ammonia refrigeration facilities, as well as the ammonia refrigeration industry.\n\n\n\nThe Ready Pac ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.

Safety features include ammonia leak detectors in the machinery room, continuous automated ventilation, microprocessor controlled compressors with automatic safety cutouts, ASME certified pressure vessels, and emergency stop controls.  The majority of the ammonia inventory is centrally located inside the machine room.  All pressure-rated vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation to protect the vessel's integrity.\n\n\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to the refrigerant in a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP regulation defines \"accident\" as the following: \n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.
