If an emergency was to occur, it is the Plant's policy to evacuate the facility and to notify the Fresno County Health Department and to coordinate with the Fresno County First Responders.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility is a Float Glass Manufacturing Plant.  Float Glass is manufactured for sale to other companies that in turn produce products like windows, mirrors, green houses, etc.   \n\n\n\nThe Facility uses 29% ammonia in its air pollution control equipment onsite.  Ammonia is injected into furnace flue gases to remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) through selective catalytic reduction (SCR).  The ammonia is delivered to the Facility via tanker truck and loaded into a 16,000 gallon tank for storage prior to use in the process.  Ammonia at a 29% concentration has a specific gravity of approximately 0.90 at 60 degrees Fahrenheit; therefore, the maximum process weight is 119,649 pounds, of which 34,698 pounds is ammonia and the remainder is water.  \n\n\n\nThe worse-case scenario for the Aqueous Ammonia would be a liquid spill and vaporization of ammonia gas.  It was assumed the entire volume of the tank releases over 10 minutes, resulting in a toxic endpoint that extends offsite a distance of 3.1 miles. No sensitive environmental receptors were identified within a 3.1-mile radius of the site.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nFive-year history:  The facility has never had an emergency involving the aqueous ammonia systems that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an em"
