              "Description": "Fertilizer Plant/ Anhydrous Ammonia- FOR PRODUCT STORAGE ONLY This plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhyrdous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks. In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise. This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system that may be under stress or about to fail. Repairs can be made before they become problematic. Employees are annually trained to recongize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition to annual training for employees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires. This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire. Finally, the company rountinely invites local fire department personnel to visit the site. In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, notify the Carroll Volunteer Fire Dept (via 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Region 5 LEPC will be made. \n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexcepted and may very well be different and cannont be ensured to duplicate what we may have planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.  \n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals, (i.e. Anhydrous Ammonia), tornados, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. \n\nThe primary emergency response coordinator for the Carroll, Iowa location is Darrell Berte, Operations Manager. His work and 24 hour emergency reponse numbers are provided in the Registration Section. The 24 hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.   \n                                                                                                                                                                     DESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT THE NEW COOPERATIVE CARR"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural corp producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in storage tanks 2-30,000 gallon tanks and 10- 1,500  nurse tanks. The maximum quantity stored would be 402,730 pounds. \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO: The worst case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the 1,500 gallon nurse tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gasous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP* Comp Program (Version 1/06), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. The alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hose. The resulting release (according to the EPA's RMP* Comp Program) has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles. \n\nSince this facility is located in relatively close proximity to the Town of Carroll, provisions have been designed to notify all affected persons. An evacuation plan is in place. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  \n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable State and local codes and regulations. The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard k-61.1-1995 and State Law. In addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia.
