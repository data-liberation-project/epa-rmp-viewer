The primary focus is to prevent accidental releases before they occur, while providing systems that minimize any release that may occur and contain it in as small of area as possible.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nIt is the facility's policy to operate the plant in a manner that protects its employees, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  The facility \n\nhas a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nBroin Enterprises (POET Research Center) operates as an ethanol fuel production and research and development plant located at Scotland, South Dakota, in Bon Homme County.  The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  The denaturant is reported to contain approximately 30 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 57,500 pounds (total pentane is 17,250 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stage of production.  The denaturant tank is located in the facility's tank farm area which includes a secondary containment dike.  Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used for product of a by-product, Carbon Dioxide.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored on site is be"

Broin Enterprises (POET Research Center) has evaluated the worst-case and alternative case scenarios as it related to the reportable substance.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe facility is committed to protection of the environment through the combined used of inspection, maintenance, employee training, and emergency response preparation. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a multi-camera video surveillance system installed at the property.  The storage tank is located in the tank farm which includes a secondary containment dike and is included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.  Numerous safeguards are in place and include operational procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and industrial practices.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nBroin Enterprises (POET Research Center) does not have a history of accidents of the RMP regulated chemical which may have caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations or in-place sheltering in the last five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has a written emergency response plan, which is in place to works and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  In the event of an emergency involving chemicals on-site, plant personnel will notify the Scotland Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nCurrently none are planned.\n\n   \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
