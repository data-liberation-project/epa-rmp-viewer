The EAP covers action to be taken in case of an unplanned release.  The mechanical integrity section of PSM discusses actions taken to prevent an unplanned accidental release of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nCGP-31 is a natural gas treating facility.  The natural gas treating includes CO2 and H2S removal using amine and glycol dehydration.  Natural gas is a mixture of primarily methane, ethane, propane, and butane.  The natural gas is transported via pipeline from the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility.  Some of the main components of this section that would help prevent the accidental, uncontrolled release of regulated substances include:  testing of critical control and shutdown instruments, testing of pressure safety valves, and routing testing of piping and vessel corrosion.  In addition, process hazard analyses have been performed on the facility and all resulting action items have been met.  Lastly, safety training for key personnel has been performed.\n\n\n\nThere has not been a recordable/off-site accident since the construction of this facility.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program for this facility is contained in the EAP.  The EAP includes actions to take in case of an uncontrolled release of hazardous substance, an uncontrollable fire, and hurricanes.  The proper action includes immediately contacting the county emergency response system which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public.  \n\n\n\nThe facility has ongoing programs that help train personnel in areas that have the greatest potential for uncontrolled release of hazardous substances.  In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard asses"
