The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge over the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. Since the facility is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119, Program 3 is required.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action Policies\r\nThe top priority of Washington Potato Company facility is to provide a healthy and safe work environment for its employees and the surrounding community.
