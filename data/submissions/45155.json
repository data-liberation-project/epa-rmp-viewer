All plant configuration, operations and emergency response practices are managed using company standard operating procedures which are a part of the Company Management Systems described below.\n\nQuality System (QS)\nStandard operating procedures for all production and related services are managed using an ISO 9000 certified Quality System. The Quality System has been certified since 1994. In October 2002 the certification was upgraded to the ISO-9001-2000 Standard. The ISO 9000 Registrar is ITS Intertek.\n \nEnvironmental Management System (EMS)\nAll environmental program procedures are included in an Environmental Management System that achieved certification under to the ISO 14001 Standard in April 2004. The ISO 14000 Registrar is also ITS Intertek. The RMP is a program procedure under the EMS. Emergency response plans are also resident here.\n \nHealth and Safety Management System (HSMS)\nAll Health and Safety written programs are already installed and controlled in the Management Systems process used by the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 programs. The existing Safety Incentive Plan implements systematic methods for monitoring and improvement of health and safety requirements and issues. The structure is modeled on of the OHSAS-18001 program, and certification will be sought should this credential receive wide acceptance.\n\nPolicy\nChemTreat is well aware that our business requires the management of certain hazardous chemicals, which if not properly controlled, introduce increased potential for harm to employees, the community and the environment. Accordingly, we have established systematic procedures to evaluate potential risks, establis"

ChemTreat is committed to compliance with all regulatory and other requirements and uses a formal review process including internal and external auditing and inspection to assure the continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of all compliance programs. \n\nFacility And Regulated Substances\nChemTreat, Inc.\u00bfs plant in Nederland, Texas is a small blending facility of industrial water treatment chemicals for use in boilers, cooling systems, and wastewater systems. Hazardous and nonhazardous chemicals that are used in the blending process are stored in specifically designed and engineered storage and processing equipment. Chemicals are blended in a batch process into ChemTreat products which are distributed directly to using customers. The only regulated substance under the RMP rule used at the facility is cyclohexylamine. The substitution of other less hazardous materials have been evaluated and some substitution has been achieved; however the use of cyclohexylamine cannot yet be completely eliminated. The on-site inventory of cyclohexylamine is unlikely to exceed the 8,000 gallons capacity of the current storage tank. Planning has begun to install a replacement tank of larger size.\n\nPrevention Program\nChemTreat, Inc. takes a systematic approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management systems address each of the key features of an accidental release prevention program including safety information, hazard review, operating procedures, training, preventive maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigation. These individual elements of our operating procedures work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. ChemTreat, Inc. and our employees integrate these management systems into the way we do business and establish specific accountability for accident prevention into our process.\n\nSafety In"

      "SummaryText": "formation\nRisk identification begins early in the product stewardship process when every new raw material proposed for addition to process use is evaluated to determine the potential hazards of the material, compatibility with existing process components and all applicable regulatory constraints. It is very unlikely that any new RMP rule regulated substances would ever be authorized for addition to our operations. The requirements to manage the risks associated with any new hazardous materials are determined and all necessary configuration changes, program procedure updates and employee training are completed prior to introduction of the new material into the process. Safety information may be in the form of the chemical MSDS sheet and label or may require specific procedures to be drafted under the appropriate management systems program.\n \nHazard Review\nIn accordance with Section 68.50 of the RMP rule, we use hazard reviews to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards. The most important products of our reviews are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases. We conduct systematic hazard reviews of the regulated process at our facility at least every five years (or more often if necessary because of process changes or incidents). A Hazard Review of the cyclohexylamine handling and storage system was completed prior to the original RMP submission. A subsequent review was done at the five-year required interval. No system changes had occurred.\n\nOperating Procedures\nIn accordance with Section 68.52 of the RMP rule, we use operating procedures to define how process-related job tasks assigned to our personnel should be performed. Procedures are maintained under the various management systems programs. The facility maintains documentation which show operator and mechanic qualifications for those responsible for the cyclohexylamine system.\n\nTraining\nIn accordance with Section 68.54 of the RMP rule, we train"

Our training program includes initial training as well as refresher training every three years, or more often if major process or equipment changes are made. As part of our training, we include provisions for ensuring that employees understand the training (field demonstrations, observation, etc.).\n\nMaintenance\nIn accordance with Section 68.56 of the RMP rule, we maintain our process equipment using an inspection and testing program and we ensure that our equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly. An automated maintenance program is produced by the corporate computer system which governs the scheduling and record of completion of periodic maintenance on covered systems. \n\nCompliance Audits\nIn accordance with Section 68.58 of the RMP rule, we conduct compliance audits to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the RMP rule. Audits are conducted in conjunction with the Semiannual Safety and Environmental Incentive Program Audits. At the completion of each audit, a report is generated which documents any noncompliance. Audit findings are addressed through the corrective action process.\n\nIncident Investigations\nIn accordance with Section 68.60 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that all incidents are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence. All incidents which caused or could have caused a release of cyclohexylamine shall be investigated no later than 48 hours of the incident. At the conclusion of the investigation, a report shall be prepared reviewed by a specially appointed investigation team. The report shall include at a minimum: the date of the incident, the date the investigation began, a description of the incident, the factors that contributed to the incident, and any recommendations resulting from the incident.\n\nFive"

ChemTreat coordinates any chemical release response actions with the Nederland Fire Department and has the appropriate mechanisms in place to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response. The facility has its own Emergency Response Plan, however response to releases of cyclohexylamine by plant personnel are limited to those actions that would be considered as similar to routine operations.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\nThe existing configuration and operations of the cyclohexylamine system are of proven reliability. Similar technology is planned for a new storage tank so that full truck-load amount of cyclohexylamine can be received with substantially reduced danger of overfilling."
