Senior management acknowledge an obligation, as an employer, to provide the safest possible working conditions for employees and contractors and to ensure the impacts on the communities they work in are minimized.

Their job sites are places that encourage and support their employees to be their best and provide every employee and contractor the unconditional right and obligation to question, stop and correct unsafe acts or conditions.  \r\n\r\nHowever, excellent safe and healthy conditions do not occur by chance.  They are the result of diligent work and careful attention to all company policies by everyone since safety demands cooperation on everyone's part.  Thus, it is important that communication will always be kept open between management and employees.  Workers who notice hazards or other safety problems, or feel that they need additional training, must notify their supervisor.  Supervisors and management at all levels are authorized to address these concerns and take corrective action when warranted.\r\n\r\nThe Site process extracts natural gas from a production well which is treated and liquefied before being stored in 10,000-gallon storage tanks (up to six storage tanks may be located at the Site at any given time, however the tanks are not interconnected or manifolded together) and subsequently trucked offsite. \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario is assumed to be the failure of a single filled 10,000-gallon storage tank and a resulting vapor cloud explosion of the entire contents of t"

Utilizing EPA RMP*CompTM, GEI modeled the potential reach and effect of a hypothetical accidental release and resulting vapor cloud explosion of LNG from one storage tank at the Facility.

This operation is defined as a stationary source using more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (methane) in a process.  Edge will develop and implement a Risk Management Plan in compliance with in compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Clean Air Act (CAA), Part 68, Section 112(r) (the Risk Management Program Rule). \r\n\r\nThe RMP is the comprehensive blueprint a facility will incorporate into process safety to protect public safety utilizing generally accepted principals to manage risks associated with the handling of regulated substances, which include: \r\n\u00bf\tIdentifying hazards which may result from accidental releases of such substances using appropriate \r\n        hazard assessment techniques. \r\n\u00bf\tDesigning and maintaining a safe facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases. \r\n\u00bf\tMinimizing the consequences of accidental releases that do occur.\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Program Rule defines three Program levels based on the processes' relative potential for public impacts and the level of effort needed to prevent accidents.

Edge has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department (Morris Township Fire Department) and Tioga County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) (Tioga County Emergency Management Services). These agencies have been notified that when responding to a fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process at the Facility, entry within the distance to the specified worst-case endpoint (0.3 miles) may pose a danger. Therefore, entry into this area should not occur unless arranged with the emergency contacts indicated in the RMP.\r\n\r\nEdge has also developed an Emergency Response (ER) plan.  The ER plan provides planned actions to take during the most common emergencies, including: fires, medical emergencies, explosions, spills, and security breaches.  Most actions described in the ER plan are related to evacuation and notification procedures. The plan also provides procedures related to fire prevention and the requirements to regularly exercise the plan.\r\n    \r\nThis RMP will be fully updated and resubmitted once every five years. Under certain circumstances, this RMP will be updated and resubmitted before its five year anniversary if required as determined in 40 CFR \u00a768.190(b)."
