This operation is defined as a stationary source using more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (methane) in a process.  Edge will develop and implement a Risk Management Plan in compliance with in compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Clean Air Act (CAA), Part 68, Section 112(r) (the Risk Management Program Rule). \n\n\n\nThe RMP is the comprehensive blueprint a facility will incorporate into process safety to protect public safety utilizing generally accepted principals to manage risks associated with the handling of regulated substances, which include: \n\n?    Identifying hazards which may result from accidental releases of such substances using appropriate \n\n        hazard assessment techniques. \n\n?    Designing and maintaining a safe facility taking such steps as are necessary to prevent releases. \n\n?    Minimizing the consequences of accidental releases that do occur.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program Rule defines three Program levels based on the processes' relative potential for public impacts and the level of effort needed to prevent accidents. The Facility is eligible for Program Level 1. Below are the criteria a source must satisfy to qualify for a Program Level 1 plan:\n\n\n\n?    There are no public receptors identified within the distance to the endpoint for a worst-case \n\n        release. \n\n?    The process has not had a release of a regulated substance in the past five years where exposure to \n\n        the regulated substance, its reaction products, overpressures generated by explosion involving the \n\n        regulated substance, or radiant heat from a fire involving the "

Senior management acknowledge an obligation, as an employer, to provide the safest possible working conditions for employees and contractors and to ensure the impacts on the communities they work in are minimized.  Edge is committed to providing a safe, accident-free, and healthy work environment for everyone.  Their job sites are places that encourage and support their employees to be their best and provide every employee and contractor the unconditional right and obligation to question, stop and correct unsafe acts or conditions.  \n\n\n\nHowever, excellent safe and healthy conditions do not occur by chance.  They are the result of diligent work and careful attention to all company policies by everyone since safety demands cooperation on everyone's part.  Thus, it is important that communication will always be kept open between management and employees.  Workers who notice hazards or other safety problems, or feel that they need additional training, must notify their supervisor.  Supervisors and management at all levels are authorized to address these concerns and take corrective action when warranted.\n\n\n\nThe Site process extracts natural gas from a production well which is treated and liquefied before being stored in 10,000-gallon storage tanks (up to six storage tanks may be located at the Site at any given time, however the tanks are not interconnected or manifolded together) and subsequently trucked offsite. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is assumed to be the failure of a single filled 10,000-gallon storage tank and a resulting vapor cloud explosion of the entire contents of t"

Utilizing EPA RMP*CompTM, GEI modeled the potential reach and effect of a hypothetical accidental release and resulting vapor cloud explosion of LNG from one storage tank at the Facility. The estimated worst-case end-points were calculated to be 0.3 miles. The Facility is in a remote area.  Using ALOHA&reg;, the hazard modeling program for the CAMEO&reg; software suite, GEI determined that  no public receptors were located within the perimeter of a worst-case scenario. \n\n\n\nEdge utilizes SMART Control Technology to safely control the liquefaction operations.  These operations are completely monitored and operated remotely. This remote monitoring system continuously controls operating parameters, equipment service requirements, and operation performance. The system includes several alarms and emergency shutdown protocols including:\n\n\n\n?    A methane detector alarm with an immediate, automatic shutdown\n\n?    High pressure sensors with immediate, automatic shutdown\n\n?    Oil low-level sensors with an immediate, automatic shutdown, including an alarm and shutdown if \n\n        there is a failure of the lubrication system\n\n?

Edge has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department (Morris Township Fire Department) and Tioga County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) (Tioga County Emergency Management Services). These agencies have been notified that when responding to a fire, explosion, or a release of a regulated substance from the process at the Facility, entry within the distance to the specified worst-case endpoint (0.3 miles) may pose a danger. Therefore, entry into this area should not occur unless arranged with the emergency contacts indicated in the RMP.\n\n\n\nEdge has also developed an Emergency Response (ER) plan.  The ER plan provides planned actions to take during the most common emergencies, including: fires, medical emergencies, explosions, spills, and security breaches.  Most actions described in the ER plan are related to evacuation and notification procedures. The plan also provides procedures related to fire prevention and the requirements to regularly exercise the plan.\n\n    \n\nThis RMP will be fully updated and resubmitted once every five years.
