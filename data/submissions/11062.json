Oxy Vinyls, LP is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical Corporation (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) and The Geon Company.  The facility is located near the Houston Ship Channel at 2400 Miller Cut-Off Road.  It was originally constructed in 1973 and currently employs 180 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a)):\nOxy Vinyls is committed to operating the LaPorte VCM Plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules/regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, Oxy Vinyls has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility, which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the LaPorte VCM Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program for the LaPorte VCM Plant.\n\nThe RMP at the LaPorte VCM Plant consists of the following three elements:\n7 A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule;\n7 A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the covered processes containing, or with the potential of involving, more than a threshold quantity of a regulate"

When a hazardous substance is used, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance (which could adversely affect plant workers, the public or the environment) and take steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) procedures, which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxy Vinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility:  Oxy Vinyls implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  When a hazardous substance is used at the LaPorte VCM Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of the equipment.  Corporate Fire, Safety and Environmental (FS&E) Guidelines are also used when designing new or modifying existing processes.  Each project is thoroughly reviewed before approval. In addition, Oxy Vinyls requires the documentation of standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure.
