      "SummaryText": "Keystone Foods' Equity Group Tennessee Division has been located at 1400 Davidson Street, Nashville, Tennessee since 1978.  The facility produces specialized poultry products for the fast food industry.  These products are quickly frozen prior to packaging and shipment.  Product freezing was by cryogenic means from 1978 until mid 1989 when the first of eventually two Frigoscandia mechanical freezing processes was installed in the facility.  The Frigoscandia process uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant for heat transfer.  The initial refrigerant charge required approximately eight thousand pounds of ammonia to operate one freezing process.\n\nThe second freezing process was installed in 1991 requiring an additional anhydrous ammonia charge of approximately four thousand five hundred pounds for a total of approximately twelve thousand five hundred pounds.  The Emergency Response Plan for the facility was redesigned and upgraded to comply with the threshold  planning quantity of greater than ten thousand pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThe facility has experienced two releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last five years.  The first incident occurred on January 18th, 1996.  Approximately six hundred pounds of ammonia were released into a process wastewater drain and to atmosphere during the incident.  The subsequent investigation revealed procedural and equipment malfunctions as the primary causes for the release.  Outside engineering consultation was employed to recommend the equipment change needed to reduce the risk of reoccurrence.  Maintenance procedures were reviewed and amended to further reduce risk of reoccurrence.\n\nThe facility experienced its' second release of ammonia on August 22nd, 1996.  The estimated amount released was determined to be approximately six hundred fifty pounds to atmosphere through a high pressure relief valve on the condenser.  The investigation of the release revealed the need to adopt additional maintenance procedures for the condenser"

      "SummaryText": " water feed system. The system is monitored and controlled by means of computer.  Consultation with the system design engineers produced recommendations that software changes be made to further reduce the risk that system pressures rise to the levels that caused the release.\nA comprehensive process safety management program has been developed and implemented at the facility for the anhydrous ammonia process.  The PSM is the cornerstone of the risk management program in place at Equity Group Tennessee Division.    \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the ammonia released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 50 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\nThe worst case scenario determined by the Equity Group RMP Team was if the high pressure receiver was emptied of it's contents.  This could potentially release 9200 lbs. at a rate of 920 lbs/min.  The vapor would travel a total distance of 3168 feet in the conditions identified by the modeling program used.  Public receptors are currently within 500' of the initial release area\nThe general Equity Group accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n7 High level of training of the operators\n7 Preventive maintenance program\n7 Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n7 Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written wi"

This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually; emergency operation and response procedures are also reviewed at that time.\nThe alternative scenario determined by the Equity Group RMP Team was if the system pressures cause a relief valve to open.  This could potentially release 600 lbs. at a rate of 60 lbs/min.  The vapor would travel a total distance of 518 feet in the conditions identified by the modeling program used.  Public receptors are currently within 500' of the initial release area.  We believe. However, with active and passive mitigation systems currently in place, that the is only a insignificant opportunity to reach a public or environmental receptor, outside of the facility compound."
