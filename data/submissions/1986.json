      "SummaryText": "The City of Washington has an Emergency Response Plan in effect and has implemented OSHA's Process Safety Management Program to deal with the regulated substances on a regular basis.\n\nThe City operates the Wastewater Treatment Plant located at 1399 West 2nd Street, in th City of Washington. The city uses chlorine in the disinfection process of treating wastewater before the water is discharged into the Tar-Pamlico River Basin.\n\nThe worst-case scenario was developed as a release quantity of 2000 pounds in 10 minutes with a distance to endpoint of 0.9 miles. The alternative scenario was a release of 180 pounds in 60 minutes with an endpoint of 0.1 miles. The passive mitigation in place is the building in which the online cylinders are stored. Any active mitigation would be applied by the Haz-Mat team and support personnel of the Washington Fire/Rescue Department. An Emergency Response Plan is in effect to supplement administrative controls.\n\nWe are in compliance with the OSHA PSM rule and the EPA RMP rule. We have invested in a computerized SCADA system which monitors our chemical release alarms 24 hours a day. Plus, we have obtained a computerized maintenance program along with regular audio/video training sessions with impacted employees.\n\nAs of this date we have not had a reportable release quantity of Chlorine in the past 5 years.\n\nWe have formulated an Emergency Response Plan in conjunction with the Washington Fire/Rescue Department and have conducted joint drills."
