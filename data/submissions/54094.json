      "SummaryText": "The City of Gillette's Water Division (COGWD) accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that uses available technology, precedures and management policies to meet requirements. The COGWD emergency policy involves the preparation of response plans tailored to each facility and to the emergency response available within the community. All applicable procedures of the EPA RMP are adhered to.\n\nMadison Pump Station (MPS) is a facility used to collect raw water from the Madison Well Field. MPS is an unmanned, remotely controlled station. MPS, for the purpose of RMP, consists of a chlorine storage room and a feed room. These two rooms have their own entrances from the outside. The rooms are beside the main pump bay. The leak repair B Kit and SCBA are located inside the front door of the pump station. The maximum amount of chlorine on site is two one ton containers (4000 lbs.), only one container is on line at once. The feed room contains feed control valves and injection equipment. MPS is equiped with a computer control operating and alarming system. Operators check the facility routinely.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of  chlorine release scenarios identified as worst case scenario (WCS), and alternative case scenario (ACS). The first scenario is defined by the RMProgram states that the owner/operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes, due to unspecified failure. The alternative release scenario is defined as a more likely to occur leak than the worst case release scenario. RMP Comp was used to model the WCS.\n\nLeak reduction, mitigation, and control devices that we have in place are: written operating procedures, chlorine gas leak detectors, emergency shutdown systems, and enclosed rooms for the chlorine containers and equipment. \n\nThree ACS's were modeled.  The first is failure of the connection between the chlorine tank and the injection equipmen"

      "SummaryText": "t.  Mishandling of a shipping container was also modeled with releases from the bottom and the top of the chlorine cylinder.  The same mitigating systems would apply as for the WCS. The chlorine gas detector would activate the emergency shutdown systems, closing the containers, and stopping the leak. Water Operators would be alerted simultateously. \n\nThe COGWD fashioned their accidental release prevention program after OSHA's PSSM program. This facility is considered unmanned and remote and is a Prevention Program Level 2 process..  \n\nThe COGWD has not had an accidental chlorine gas release over the past ten years.\n\nThe COGWD's emergency response plans have been coordinated with the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Department, and personnel have been trained by the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Department. The COGWD personnel have had hazmat training, respiratory protection (SCBA) training, and the required first aid training. Drills are conducted by the Campbell CountyLEPC/Fire Department with COGWD personnel. Since this facility is in Crook County, there is a mutual aid agreement between COGWD and Campbell County LEPC/Fire Department to respond to an emergency leak situation. The rooms containing the chlorine containers and equipment do have leak detectors and are tied into the alarm system.\n\nMadison Pump Station equipment has recently been updated to improve safety. Training and drills will continue as usual. The City of Gillette also has a safety committee that inspects all facilities periodically to make sure procedures are followed and hazards are not overlooked."
