The Facility is an existing operating source. This document has been prepared in order to address the following issues:\n\n* Acknowledge the operation of an existing source with processes subject to the RMP regulations and requirements.\n\n* Incorporate revisions to the RMP pursuant to the requirements of the CalARP and 40 CFR 68 regulations.\n\nThe RMP addresses the requirements of the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) as adopted by the State of California as outlined in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19. These federal and state requirements build upon the provisions of the ?general duty clause? of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and the federal RMP program requirements in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 68, which require the following activities of all facilities which produce, process, store, or handle listed substances:\n\n* Identify hazards,\n\n* Design and maintain a safe facility,\n\n* Prevent releases,\n\n* Minimize the consequences of releases.\n\nThe required approach to accomplishing the above, pursuant to the CalARP and Federal RMP regulations, is to have a documented Risk Management Plan, which outlines the steps and procedures a facility must take to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. The Tremont Group, Inc. has chosen to prepare and implement its RMP for the storage and handling of aqua ammonia and regulated pesticides, in order to fulfill its obligations with respect to the RMP regulations and the General Duty clause and to protect its employees and the surrounding community from the effects of accidental releases.\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR 68.155 and CCR Title 19, Section 2745.3, the following summary is given:\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nThe primary activity at the Pleasant Gro"

The Pleasant Grove Facility handles aqua ammonia as the nitrogen source for fertilizer. Aqua ammonia is stored in two 11,000-gallon above ground tanks at the Facility.  The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled at the facility is 165,000 pounds. The total quantity of ammonia present in aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight is 41,250 lbs.\n\nSubstance Used/Stored: Aqua Ammonia  (CAS# 7664-41-7) Max. Qty: 165,000 lbs\n\nFacility SIC: 5191    NAICS Code: 42491 Concentration: 25 wt%\n\n\n\nSeveral regulated pesticides are stored at the Pleasant Grove facility warehouse.  All pesticides are stored with like or compatible materials based on the product labels and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs).  Quantities of regulated pesticides at the Facility fluctuate daily as shipments are received and sales made of pesticides.  The materials are stored in the original manufacturer?s packaging which includes 30-gallon drums or cylinders, 2.5-gallon plastic bottles, 1-gallon, plastic bottles in cardboard boxes, and bags of varying sizes.  Pesticides containing regulated substances are not blended or repackaged at the Facility.  Worst-case and alternative release scenarios for pesticides were not modeled for this RMP.  \n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency action policies at the facility are delineated in Sections 3.0 and 11.0 respectively. A brief description of the prevention and emergency response policies is as follows.\n\nAccident Prevention Program Policies and Elements\n\nThe accident prevention program is implemented through an established set of policies and programs including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n* Inspection and maintenance program for all system equipment\n\n* Monitoring of"

As such, no passive mitigation factor was used in the worst-case ammonia emissions calculations and impact analyses. For aqueous ammonia, the unloading hose, per facility estimates, is approximately 3.0 inch in diameter (ID) and 30 feet long. The volume of the unloading hose was calculated and then doubled to account for additional drainage losses. This loss was assumed to completely evaporate over the 10 minute time period. Rupture of the unloading hose would also occur outside of th"

No outside individuals or sensitive receptors would be affected in the effect of a release.\n\nThe piping and distribution network for aqua ammonia is equipped with a number of manual and automatic valves, which effectively limit the amount and duration of any accidental release. In addition, the tank areas are equipped with emergency eyewash and safety showers.  The pesticides are stored within a warehouse, which will contain a liquid release of pesticide and control the dispersion.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is comprised of the following elements:\n\n* Proper maintenance of all system equipment.\n\n* Proper operation of all system equipment.\n\n* Internal operating policies with respect to ammonia tank capacity.\n\n* Comprehensive personnel training.\n\n* A written emergency response plan.\n\n* A written hazardous materials management plan.\n\n* Documented safety procedures for employees and contractors.\n\n* Inclusion of ammonia specific health, safety, and response data in the RMP.\n\nThe facility is an existing source and has not experienced an accidental release of ammonia or any other hazardous substance in the last 5 years.\n\nThe current emergency response plan and procedures for The Tremont Group are discussed in detail in Section 10.0 and Appendix A. The local fire department will be the first responder in an ammonia emergency.  Tremont Group personnel will perform \"awareness\" duties only, which simply means that once the ammonia spill or release is discovered, Tremont Group personnel will make the proper notifications and set the emergency procedures in motion. In the event of a major release, The Tremont Group may join forces with the fire department and State/County OES personnel in a \"unified command effort\" until the emergency has been mitigated.\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Elements\n\nChemical specific prevention measures are summarized as follows:\n"

Data developed from the operational experience at these facilities will be directly applied to the operation and safety aspects of the Pleasant Grove facility, and vice versa. Operational and safety issues identified at any Tremont Group facility are immediately analyzed for applicability to other operational sites. \n\nThe facility will constantly strive for improved performance and reliability from all its processes. As specific process and safety improvements are identified they will be evaluated by staff for application and implementation.\n\nTraining\n\nThe facility staff, as well as The Tremont Group corporate staff, understands that incidents involving the accidental release of listed substances can be reduced and/or eliminated by having trained operations and maintenance staff. A training program, which incorporates specific operating procedures and safe work practices, is an essential element of an effective prevention program.\n\nThe current training program is comprised of the following:\n\n* Initial employee training\n\n* Periodic re-training and certification\n\n* Training provided as a result of a new equipment addition or modification per the RMP Change Management (RMPCM)\n\n* Refresher training\n\n* Training records for each employee\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe mechanical integrity element of the facility operations procedures ensures that new and modified equipment or processes are manufactured to meet process requirements, that the"

The investigation results, including the implementation of all recommendations, are reviewed with facility staff whose job responsibilities are relevant to the findings. Copies of the investigation reports are maintained on site for a minimum of five years, and are used during the periodic PHA re-evaluations.\n\nRMP Change Management\n\nOperational, safety, and environmental issues must be addressed whenever a change occurs at a facility, which involves an affected process or substance. Quite often a change made in one aspect of the process may affect other parts of the process due to facility system integration. Such changes must be reviewed prior to initiation, to ensure that they do not compromise the operational safety and integrity of the process, and to minimize adverse effects to worker safety and public health. The facility RMPCM procedures are used to evaluate all changes to the following types of systems:\n\n* Process chemicals (delivery, storage, handling)\n\n* Control technology systems (operation rates, chemicals used, by-products or wastes produced)\n\n* Equipment design and construction\n\n* Operations and maintenance procedures\n\n* Other changes to facility equipment or processes\n\nThe current RMPCM procedures, developed by The Tremont Group and Pleasant Grove facility staff, are used for the Pleasant Grove facility to track changes in equipment or processes as identified or planned by facility personnel.
