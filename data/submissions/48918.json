      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nBlackhawk Station is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is Blackhawk Station?s policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe facility?s primary activities encompass electric power and steam generation as a Qualifying Facility cogeneration power plant.  Blackhawk Station has one (1) regulated substance present at the facility.  This substance is identified as Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used for stack Nox emission control.\n\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for the facility, Blackhawk Station used the EPA's RMP* Comp Version 1.07 Software Program.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the anhydrous ammonia storage tank.  In this scenario 58,500 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has been considered to be 100% of the maximum capacity of the source.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 2.8 miles is obtained, corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release"

      "SummaryText": " from the vapor gas piping.  The scenario involves the release of 1,280 lb. of inventory.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released in gaseous form.  The failure is considered to have ended after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).  These active mitigation systems have the effect of limiting the quantity released to that of 2.2% of the maximum capacity of the system.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.1 miles.\n\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nBlackhawk Station has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBlackhawk Station maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nBlackhawk Station conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years as well as any time material equipment is replaced, or controls are modified.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA review was performed on 06/14/2007.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered processes, Blackhawk Station maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such"

The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  The latest review and update of Operating Procedures was performed on 3/23/2007\n\nTraining\nBlackhawk Station has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years, and more frequently as needed.  Updates to the Training Procedure were made on 4/20/2006.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nBlackhawk Station carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Blackhawk Station to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review of maintenance procedures was performed on 12/08/2005.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at Blackhawk Station.  The most recent review was performed on 07/09/2002.  These reviews are conducted to con"

The Ammonia System at Blackhawk has been in continuous operation since the initial construction.  There have been no incidents regarding the integrity of the system to warrant shutting it down since that time. \n\nCompliance Audits\nBlackhawk Station conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 12/08/2005.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nBlackhawk Station promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nBlackhawk Station truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility?s implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, Blackhawk Station hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Five-year Accident History\nBlackhawk Station has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases that resulted in injuries or fatalities, damages to equipment, or offsite impacts during this period.\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\nBlackhawk Station maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  The most recent review and revision of the Emergency Response Plan was done on 3/12/2007\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSince the construction and initiation of the Anhydrous Ammonia System at Blackhawk there have been very limited changes necessary to improve Safety.  Minor changes such as revision of the Training Procedure and changes made to the Inspection Checklist have been implemented to further improve on an inherently safe system.  No physical modifications to the system have been necessary."
