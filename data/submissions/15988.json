The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including incident command, proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the Mobile Site has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the processes or other facility areas.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\nThe overall emergency response program for the Mobile Site is coordinated with the Mobile County, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n     Contractors\n     The Mobile Site uses contractors to supplement its workforce and during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Mobile Site evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at the Mobile Site have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, the facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.

We take a systemic approach to HSE management and strive for continuous improvement.  At Shell's Mobile Site, our goal is the prevention of accidents and releases.  Programs to achieve this include training for personnel, complying with industry and company standards for safety in materials in design and operation, conducting periodic hazards analyses of processes, evaluating the possible safety and environmental effects of changes before they are implemented, properly and pro-actively maintaining equipment assets, performing routine inspection of equipment, etc.  If an accident or release does occur, it is investigated to determine the cause(s) and to finds way to prevent recurrence.  Plant personnel are also trained to respond to control or contain a release, should one occur, and to minimize its impact. \n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Mobile Site is located approximately 13 miles north of Mobile, Alabama. The facility includes a variety of processes for refining crude oil into petroleum products and chemical feedstocks. Products from the facility include gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, propane, butane, and olefin feed - a chemical feedstock used elsewhere for the production of other chemical products.  The plant has four regulated flammables including propane, butane, isobutane and isopentane. \n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Mobile Site is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing normal butane."

All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.   To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

Although there are controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS, consistent with the requirements of the RMP guidelines. The alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the Mobile Site is a VCE resulting from the release of butane from a gasket leak.  The release is expected to be isolated by the operators within 10   minutes (active mitigation).  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this event does not reach offsite receptors.    The plant does not produce or store regulated toxic materials above the threshold quantity limit, thus no toxic WCS or ARS are addressed in this executive summary and RMP Plan.  \n\n\t\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Mobile Site.

The Mobile Site ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process \ncontrols and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (including shutdown systems).  The facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment to include, but not limited to materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

Within this program, each covered process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The Mobile Site primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.
