Anhydrous ammonia is a \n\ngas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system \n\nis used to control the processing and storage temperature for ice cream, \n\nmilk, and related products.  It is a closed system that contains \n\napproximately 13,800 pounds (i.e., 2,600 gallons) of ammonia in various \n\nphysical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the \n\nhigh pressure receiver that operates at approximately 150 pounds per \n\nsquare inch gauge (psig) and can contain as much as 2,840 pounds of \n\nliquid ammonia (at its maximum safe fill volume of 90 percent).  However, \n\nduring typical operation, the vessel holds only about 1,300 pounds.  Most \n\nof the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, \n\nmake-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\n\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \n\nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \n\nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \n\npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \n\nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \n\npiping, and equipment.\n\n\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Muller-Pinehurst Dairy ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage \n\nsystem.  The high pressure receiver supplies high-pressure (135 to \n\n190 psig) liquid ammonia to several units including:  the 3-barrel ice cream \n\nfreezer, lower co"

The receiver also feeds ammonia to the intercooler, which in \n\nturn feeds additional units including: storage area unit, large hardening \n\nroom unit, small hardening room unit #1, new and old ice builders, and \n\nhalf-gallon air units 1 through 3. \n\n\n\nThe Mueller vat, hardening rooms, storage area, and ante room units \n\nreturn liquid/vapor ammonia to one suction trap.  The suction \n\ntrap is designed to supply liquid free suction to the booster \n\ncompressors.  Booster compressors supply ammonia vapor at 25 psig to \n\nthe intercooler.  Ammonia vapor from the intercooler is fed to one of five \n\nhigh stage compressors (four reciprocating compressors and one screw \n\ncompressor).  The major discharge from the high-stage compressors (hot \n\ngas), at 135 to 190 psig, is vented to two condensing towers.  The \n\ncondensed liquid is returned to the high-pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \n\nsafety systems/hardware, including safety relief valves, engine room \n\nventilation, and system safety interlocks.  Safety relief valves protect the \n\ncompressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, \n\nand the intercooler from the hazards associated with overpressure.  Safety \n\ninterlocks include high pressure and high temperature alarms and cutouts \n\nfor the compressors, as well as high level floats and sensors for the system \n\nvessels.  The high-pressure cutouts for the compressors are set at 200 psig.\n\n\n\nA release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n\n\n\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n\n\n\n* "

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n\n\n\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n\n\n\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the \"What-if/checklist\" technique.

The PHA will be updated and revalidated every five years.\n\n\n\n* Written operating procedures (OPs) were prepared to provide the basis for proper and safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The OPs include procedures for normal operation, startup, shutdown, emergency operation, and emergency shutdown.  They also describe safe operating limits for temperature and pressure, the consequences of operating outside these safe operating limits, and a description of safety systems and how they operate.\n\n\n\n* Refrigeration system operators receive refresher training at least every three years.  The training content is based upon the process safety information and operating procedures.  The training program ensures that the operators understand the nature and causes of problems arising from system operations and serves to increase awareness with respect to the hazards particular to ammonia and the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\n* Formal authorization systems (i.e., management of change procedure, pre-startup safety review) are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are as safe as the original design and that an independent recheck, prior to start-up, confirms that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and safety requirements.  \n\n\n\n* Events that might (or did) cause an accidental or unexpected release of ammonia are subjected to a formal investigation.
