      "SummaryText": "Dixie's Milner Terminal is an LPG pipeline terminal connected to Dixie's interstate LPG pipeline system, The facility is operated in compliance with applicable regulations of the Department of Transportation, 49 CFR Part 195. In addition, the facility maintains compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management in 29 CFR 1910.119 as well as other industry codes and standards.\n\nMilner Terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane, the storage of ethyl Mercaptan, and the loading of propane tank trucks. The purpose of ethyl Mercaptan is for odorizing the propane as it is loaded onto propane trucks. The facility consists of pressure storage tanks, a truck loading dock, associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment. The process and storage serves a function that is incident to transportation.\n\nThe facility has several systems in place to prevent an accidental release of propane, including continuous remote monitoring of flows, pressures and levels from Dixie's control center. Ethyl Mercaptan tanks are filled manually with on site personnel monitoring tanks levels and pressure to prevent over-filling. In addition, there are various alarms and shut downs designed to prevent over-pressure or over-filling of tanks and tank trucks. Pressure relief valves also protect vessels and process piping.\n\nDixie Pipeline has a thorough Mechanical Integrity Program and safety procedures to protect against accidental release. Dixie Pipeline has an Emergency Manual that includes response procedures and personnel training requirements for emergency preparedness.\n\nDixie's Program 3 worst case, involving propane, as defined in 40 CFR 68, involves the failure of one pressure storage tank, instantaneously releasing the maximum allowable quantity of propane stored and resulting in a lower flammable limit which endpoint reaches offsite.\n\nThe alternate case release scenario involving propane resulted in the contents of one pressure storage tank being release"

      "SummaryText": "d through a 2\" relief stack and resulting in a vapor cloud fire.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release of propane, the facility has a fail-safe system to mitigate the release. An emergency shut down (ESD) system will shut down pipeline receipts and truck loading, and isolate storage tanks and piping. The ESD system can be activated manually on site, remotely by the control center, or by one of the strategically placed gas detection devices.\n\nDixie's Program 1 worst case involving ethyl Mercaptan, as defined in 40 CFR 68, involves the failure of one pressure storage tank, instantaneously releasing the maximum allowable quantity of ethyl Mercaptan stored. Based on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case accidental release scenario for ethyl Mercaptan is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor. No additional measures are necessary to prevent off site impacts from accidental releases.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving the release of propane or ethyl Mercaptan, which resulted in injury, death, property or environmental damage in the past 5 years. In case of an accident, the facility ESD system would be activated and the local response agency would be called.\n\nDixie evaluates its facilities regularly to ensure that good safety practices are employed and policies and procedures are updated as need for safety improvement."
