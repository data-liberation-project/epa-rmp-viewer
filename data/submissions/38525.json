The system is defined as a closed loop \"Direct\" type system.\n\nDon Miguel Mexican Foods, Inc. has developed a risk management program according to EPA's Risk Management Program regulation (40 CFR Part 68) and to address California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4, Sections 2735-2785) to enhance already existing safety and emergency action programs. Don Miguel is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Don Miguel?s staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using ammonia as a refrigerant.\n\nDon Miguel Mexican Foods, Inc. has two distinct and separate ammonia systems.

At this point the ammonia flashes down to saturation temperature prior to being pumped to the evaporators. Liquid vapor mixture is returned to the accumulator from the evaporators where the gas is separated from the liquid. The gas is then drawn to the compressor where it is compressed and the pressure is increased to condensing pressure. The superheated compressor discharge travels to the evaporative condenser where the ammonia gas gives up its heat and is condensed to a liquid and returned to the high pressure receiver to begin the cycle once again.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description:Per the RMP and CalARP regulations one worst case analysis has been defined as a release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the larges"

Only one worst case scenario is given as this represents the worst case from either of the two systems. Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, portions of the Ammonia Refrigeration System are located outside, and therefore, no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation features was taken for the worst-case release scenario.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by the RMP and CalARP regulations.  The EPA?s RMP*Comp Dispersion Modeling Software and the publicly available SLAB Dispersion Modeling Software were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm.  The results show that off-site areas may be affected including Edison Field.  RMP*Comp was used to benchmark the results, and the final endpoint distances were calculated using SLAB to provide more accurate, yet still ?conservative?, results. This WCS is highly unlikly to occur because of active mitagation measures that can be taken and weather conditions that are unlikly as well.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description:A more realistic alternative release scenario was modeled as a release of anhydrous ammonia liquid as a result of an ammonia transfer hose failure for 1 minute.  For this alternative release scenario, the total quantity of ammonia calculated to be released is 50 pounds. This ARS was developed by the  team looked at the process hazard analysis, the five year accident history and the history of incidents for similar facilities throughout the industry.\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used, except for wind speed (3.5 m/s) which represents local conditions  accurately.

The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  Although off-site areas may also be affected for this alternative release scenario, the maximum endpoint distance for this alternative release scenario is just beyond the Don Miguel Facility perimeter. Therefore members of the general public are unlikly to be affected.\n\nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; the Don Miguel Facility has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make this type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entertainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n- There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n- Diking and floor drains in the Engine Room would provide containment for liquid release and therefore minimize the potential for offsite impact.\n- Although portions of the Ammonia Refrigeration System are outside the Engine Room, at any particular time, a large fraction of the ammonia is located in the Engine Room.  Conservatively, no credit for enclosure mitigation was taken.\n-"

The seismic assessment described in this report, which was performed for the existing equipment and their supports, was based on this UBC demand earthquake.  Any recommended modifications to the equipment and supports for seismic concerns should also meet this demand acceleration and its related seismic effects.\n - No known fault trace transects the site, and therefore the potential for fault rupture at the site is remote.  Evaluation of the site for liquefaction potential would require a more detailed assessment of the characteristics of the soils underlying the facility.\n - The potential for landslides due to seismic activity affecting the facility site is low, since the site has negligible topographic relief and is not located in a hillside area.\n - The site is located more than 10 miles inland from the coast so the potential for tsunami inundation at the site is highly unlikely."
