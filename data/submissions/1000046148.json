Management recognizes that leadership in environmental protection is critical to all of our stakeholders, customers and the communities where we have a presence.  We meet or exceed all applicable federal, state and local standards in the operation of our plant.  Our stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used in our refrigeration system to maintain and control temperatures of our manufacturing processes.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures to inhibit microbiological growth.\n\nWe comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), OSHA Emergency Action Plan, EPA Oil Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure plan (SPCC), and applicable EPCRA regulations at state and local levels.  Preventive Maintenance is tracked via computer based maintenance management system.   This builds trend history that is allowing us to become predictive vs. preventive in our maintenance and further ensuring the safe operation of our system.  Management of Change and Pre Start Safety Review are principles from PSM that are being deployed to all of our process lines to ensure safe design and operation.  Contractors are required to submit information on their safety performance and if CKS standards are met, they are approved to work for Cargill Kitchen Solutions.  Before work is started, all contractors complete an orientation to ensure understanding of Cargill Kitchen Solutions policies, rules and permit procedures. \n\nCargill Kitchen Solutions, Mason City, IA has had no reportable quantity releases in the last five years.
