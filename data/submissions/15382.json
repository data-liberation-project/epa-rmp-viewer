Since the mathematical approximation processes used in ALOHA are less accurate than those used in DEGADIS, The Minute Maid Company decided to use the DEGADIS model rather than the ALOHA simplification.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     The worst case scenario would involve the catastrophic failure of the low-pressure receiver, which has the capacity to hold the entire contents of the large refrigeration system during a maintenance condition.  As specified in the RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, the worst case scenario assumes that the entire contents of the vessel (11,260 pounds)  is released over a period of 10 minutes, yielding a release rate of 1,126 pounds per minute. Under worst case weather conditions (Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed) as required by the RMP rule, DEGADIS yielded a distance of  0.99 miles to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (200 ppm) (zone of influence).  The estimated residential population for the zone of influence is approximately 500 based on 1990 census data calculated by LANDVIEW III software.  Other public receptors identified within the zone of influence include at least one recreation area and commercial/industrial areas.  No environmental receptors are known to be located within the zone of influence.\n\n     Several alternative release scenarios were evaluated; however, most of these scenarios, when modeled, did not reach a toxic endpoint offsite.  For the purpose of this RMP submission, the following alternative release scenario was chosen because it is one of the few that would reach an endpoint offsite as required by the RMP rule.  The scenario chosen involves the slow leak of ammonia from a source equivalent to a 0.125 inch hole in the high pressure part of the ammonia system.  This scenario could be representative of multiple situations such as a small hole in a vessel or pi"

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n     The Minute Maid Company is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances.   However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the City of Apopka Department and the Florida District 6 LEPC for emergency response support.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n     This facility is used for the production of juice and fruit drink products.   Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity.  It is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system.  The system's purpose is to provide cold storage capabilities for certain products.  The amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system totals approximately 11,260 pounds.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\n     To evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the computer dispersion model DEGADIS was utilized exclusively.  While the DEGADIS model is not specifically referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, the ALOHA-DEGADIS model is listed as"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n                                                            Compliance Audits\n\nThe Minute Maid Company will conduct audits on a regular basis to ensure that the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly implemented.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of ammonia occur.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\n     The facility has not experienced any ammonia releases in the past five years.  As part of a facility modification, the ammonia refrigeration system at this facility has been completely rebuilt within the last year.  Prior to its recommissioning in late 1998, the plant was shut down for two years.  \n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\n     The Minute Maid Company Emergency Response Policy focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with local emergency response agencies performing all rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions.  The facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including an ammonia release.
