In addition, EPA requested an update as part of a Preliminary Determinations Letter dated October 7, 2004 as a result of an EPA Audit of our RMP on July 20, 2004.\n\nThis update to our RMP includes updated emergency contact information (added e-mail address for the emergency contact person) and has had the worst case scenario information removed from this executive summary. Please note that as in all previous submittals that the RMP Submit was prepared by SII personnel and no contractor was used.\n\nSII is strongly committed to provide a safe and healthy workplace for its employees, and to protect the safety and health of its neighbors. SII's commitment to prevention of accidental releases at its facility is inherent through all phases of manufacturing processes from maintenance, contractor and employee training, to design, installation, and operating procedures. SII's approach to chemical safety conforms to, or exceeds, federal and state regulations, as well as industry standards. In the event of an unforeseeable release, SII is committed to our on-site emergency response personnel and local emergency responding agencies to control and mitigate the effects of such a release. \n\nSII is a manufacturer of alkylphenols, phenolic resins, and industrial coatings. We currently have one (1) regulated substance at our facility, aqueous formaldehyde solutions, which is used in our phenol-formaldehyde resin batch manufacturing processes. \n\nSII has developed a management system to comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM-29CFR Part 1910) regulations and the accidental release prevention requirements established under the Risk Management Program (RMP-40CFR Part 68). SII's prevention program contains all of the Process Safety Management elements which are in place in our facility, such as extensive recordkee"

      "SummaryText": "ping, process hazards analyses of covered processes, safe operating procedures, extensive employee training programs, mechanical integrity programs, management of change procedures, prestartup reviews, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation programs, and contractor safety performance evaluation and training. SII has also incorporated numerous process controls and failsafe systems to significantly reduce the risk of an accidental release from its facility. Examples of these controls and systems include high and low level alarms, metered supply lines, temperature alarms, pressure alarms and relief devices, pH alarms, secondary or backup systems, quench systems, interlocks, automatic shutoffs, check valves, grounding equipment, and purge systems. In addition, much of our process equipment is computer automated.    \n\nSII has not had any accidental releases of formaldehyde in the past five years.  \n\nSII has written an emergency response plan for guidance during an accidental release and other site emergencies. This plan is structured to provide for orderly transition from normal to emergency situations, assist in confinement of a fire or chemical release to its' place of origin, aid outside responding agencies in an emergency situation and inform employees and the public of hazards at the facility which may dictate an emergency situation. SII's emergency response plan also includes other aspects of emergency response such as incident command structure, first aid, medical treatment, employee accountability, location and maintenance of response equipment, evacuations, and decontamination procedures. \n\nSII is continually improving operations and procedures to improve employee and plant safety. Some of the improvements currently in progress include implementing the Responsible Care program, upgrading existing storage tank facilities, and implementing a plantwide management of change system."
