      "SummaryText": "Eastside Utility strives to operate its water filtration plant in a safe manner that complies with the applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  As dictated by the EPA, this RMP was conducted to identify the risks of using chlorine gas for the disinfection of the water.  Two scenarioes of a chlorine release were investigated.  The first, the worst case scenario, was defined as the release of one ton of chlorine in an unmitigated situation.  This could happen if a full, one ton cylinder was dropped and ruptured while being loaded into the chlorine building at the filtration plant.  It would be unmitigated as the loading dock is in the open air.  Using RMP Comp, the distance to toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) was 1.3 miles (6864 feet).  Using this distance as a radius, a cirlce was drawn, with the filtration plant as the center, on a map from the Hamilton Couty GIS department.  Then the census data from 2000 was used in determining the population affected.  The area surrounding the plant as a density of 902 - 1261 people per square mile however about one third of the area is uninhabited as it is a mostly abandoned industrial park.  The calculations yielded an affected population of approximately 4000.  In the event of such a release, the fire department would be called and warnings posted via the local news and radio stations.  The most likely or alternative release is the gas that could escape during switch-over process to a full cylinder.  The supply line would be the most likely area of a leak.  Using RMP Comp, the distance to toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles which would only effect the Eastside Utility employees.  Therefore, no public notification would be necessary.   \nEastside Utility has not had any release accidents in the past five years.  Training sessions are conducted annually to keep the employees updated on the processes, hazards, and corrections involved in working in the presence of chlorine."
