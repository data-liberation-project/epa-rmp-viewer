Although the Pittsburg facility is not subject to California's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management requirements, Shell has developed several similar procedures to protect the health and safety of their workers, the public, and the environment. The following summarizes portions of the Management System that are most closely aligned with OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements:\r\n\t\r\n\tManagement of Change\r\n\t\r\nShell has a Management of Change (MOC) procedure requiring a comprehensive review of all proposed process changes prior to implementation.

This is also an update of the April 2017 Cal-ARP document presented to the Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD), for the Shell Catalysts & Technologies Pittsburg facility located at 2840 Willow Pass Road in Bay Point, California. Shell Catalysts & Technologies Pittsburg qualifies for Program Level 1 under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP and Cal-ARP regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP update summarizes the accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Shell Catalysts & Technologies Pittsburg that minimize the public's exposure to regulated substances used at the facility.  \r\n\r\n\r\n1.1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \r\n\r\nSince Shell Catalysts & Technologies Pittsburg is ISO 9001 certified, several programs are in place to maintain the safe operation, installation, and modification of process equipment at the facility, and to minimize errors and accidents. Shell is committed to being a responsible member of the community by operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner. This commitment is documented in the company's policy on health, security, safety and environmental (HSSE) performance.  Included in this policy are statements that Shell companies are committed to: \r\n  \r\n\u00bf\tPursue the goal of no harm to people\r\n\u00bf\tProtect the environment\r\n\u00bf\tUse material and energy efficiently to provide our products and services;\r\n\u00bf\tRespect our neighbors and contribute to the societies in which we operate;\r\n\u00bf\tDevelop energy resources, products and services consistent with these aims;\r\n\u00bf\tPublicly report on our performance;\r\n\u00bf\tPlay a leading role in promoting best practice in our industries;\r\n\u00bf\tManage HSSE matters as any other critical business activity; and\r\n\u00bf\tPromote a culture in which all Shell employees share this commitment.\r\n\r\nIn this way we aim to have an HSSE performance we can be proud of, to earn the confid"

These include response and management of any accidental release and/or injury that may pose an impact to the community. These procedures are included in the Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) submission annually. In 2015, the site established a fully functioning Hazardous Material Emergency Response Team and is now a responding facility. Emergency response activities for RMP/CalARP and other hazardous materials may be handled internally with the Shell Emergency Response Team or can be coordinated with the Contra Costa County Hazardous Material Team or the San Ramon Valley Hazardous Material Team. Emergency response activities for medical, rescue and other emergencies are coordinated with Contra Costa Fire Department, located two blocks from the facility."

All contractors are required to complete training on the hazards and emergency response activities at the facility prior to starting work. Contractor activities are monitored to verify safe work practices and appropriate training. \r\n\t\r\n\tSafety Work Permits/Hot Work Permits/Confined Space Permits \r\n\t\r\n\tAll equipment installation and maintenance work requires use of a work permit process, including issuance of safety work permits for general work permits, hot work permits, and confined space permits when applicable. Each Safety Work Permit identifies the work to be performed, equipment involved, precautions to be taken, dates, and authorized signatures. For Hot Work Permits, fire prevention measures are also included. Shell staffs a confined space rescue team which must be present during confined space entries. Copies of all permits are maintained.\r\n\t\r\n\tTraining\r\n\t\r\nTo ensure that processes are operated by competent individuals, training is a key component of Shell's Management System.
