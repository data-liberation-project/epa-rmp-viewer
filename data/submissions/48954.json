In addition to other state and local codes applicable to our facility and process. We have undertaken this process to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of Anhydrous Ammonia in our facility.\n\nOur goal is to promote overall worker, public, and plant safety. The Dannon Company facility is located at 216 Southgate Drive, Minster, Ohio. We manufacture some of the finest cultured dairy products (yogurt) in the world. The facility covers approximately 300,000 square feet and includes processing tanks, piping, packaging equipment, raw materials warehousing, finished goods refrigerated storage, an Ammonia refrigeration engine room, boilers, and miscellaneous utilities. Also located at the facility are a raw milk processing plant, shipping and receiving docks, and a waste water treatment plant. \n\nThe facility produces and ships approximately 400 million pounds of finished product each year.  The refrigeration system required for our production process necessitates the submission of this Risk Management Plan. The refrigeration system contains in excess of 30,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. This surpasses the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds outlined in Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program regulations.\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nThe Dannon Company has implemented numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.  Our saf"

These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\n\nThe Dannon Company has organized the information and polices pertaining to the process into a complete library. This library also incorporates the use of videos and computerized tests.\n\nVolume 1 of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates several policies. Many policies are included in Volume 1, the remaining are referenced from other training manuals maintained in the facility.\n\nA policies included in volume 1 is a Plan of Employee Participation. This policy outlines the commitment between management and employees to establish a program for a successful (safe) program.\n\nThe Written Process Safety information includes information on the ammonia inventory at the facility, applicable codes, design standards, and information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia (referenced from the IIAR ammonia Data Book).\n\nA Policy for Opening the Ammonia Refrigeration System has been included. It incorporates procedures for working on the ammonia refrigeration system in the few areas not covered by a standard operating procedure (new equipment tie-ins, isolation and removal of existing equipment, evacuation and abandonment of refrigeration mains, etc.)\n\nThe Support Personnel Entry policy establishes a program that covers the entrance and exit of the facility by employees, management, contractors, and visitors.\n\nAn extensive Contractor Qualification Program has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are qualified to work on the system, trained in the hazards associated with their work, and made aware of the hazards presented by the facility to the employees of the contractor.\n\nA Management of Change and Pre-Startup Safety review program has been developed to monitor and pro"

For information specific to these see the Site Safety Coach.\n\nWritten Emergency Response Plan is for all types of emergencies is also included in Volume I of the PSM / RMP Binder System.\n\nVolume 2 incorporates information on the specific system components (Pumps, vessels, compressors, evaporators, evaporative condensers, purgers, piping systems, heat exchangers, the emergency ventilation system, and general safety). This information is used as a reference source for the operator to positively identify system components. This manual also provides a checklist for performing the yearly Mechanical Integrity Inspection.\n\nVolume 3 incorporates a complete valve list. The valve list contains information on the type, port size, identifying number, use, location, model, manufacturer, drawing reference, and normal operating position of each valve in the system.\n\nAlso included in volume 3 is the Process and Instrumentation Diagrams for the individual system components. Flow schematics are included showing the entire system. A Block flow diagram provides a brief overview of the system. Drawings are included showing symbol and abbreviation descriptions. Plan views are included to allow the operator to physically locate equipment in the building.\n\nVolume 4 incorporates a complete set of standard operating procedures, describing the proper steps for preparing components for start-up, starting components, monitoring normal operation of system components, shutting down components as part of normal operation, restarting equipment as part of normal operation, shutting down equipment for maintenance, re"
