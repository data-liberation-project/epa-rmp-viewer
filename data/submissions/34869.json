Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\nLone Star Gas Liquids Processing is committed to conducting their operation in a safe and responsible manner.  They will conduct operations in compliance with applicable industry standards, OSHA?s Process Safety Management Standard and EPA?a Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. Their personnel will be trained and prepared to respond to operational emergencies safely and effectively, minimizing the risk to personnel, the public, and the community-at-large. They will ensure that their emergency response plans and capabilities are compatible with the local emergency response agencies.\n   \n2. The facility and regulated substances handled:\nThe facility is approximately 40 acres in size and is located approximately 10 miles northwest of Bakersfield, California and 7 miles south of Shafter, California. The plant processes liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) into a mixture of normal butane, propane, natural gasoline, and isobutane. The specific regulated substances handled by the facility are: methane, butane, isobutane, propane, and pentane.  \n\nThe butamer unit converts normal butane into isobutane using a platinum catalyst.  The resulting butane/isobutane mix is then sent to the deisobutanizer unit for separation.  The isobutane is separated from the mixture and sent to storage as a final product for sale as a feedstock.  The normal butane is returned to the process for recycling.  All units are interconnected and considered to be a single LPG processing plant.\n\nThe hydrogen unit produces hydrogen that is used in the butamer reaction.  Steam and natural gas are reacted together to produce hydrogen and other byproducts.  The hydrogen is then purified and sent to the butamer unit.\n\nThe specific processes used in the production of isobutane are: LPG fractionation, butane isomerization, butane hydrotreating, and hydrogen generation.   Heat for the butamer and deisobutanizer processes is provided by a hot oil sys"

The emergency response program:\nThe emergency response program is written and posted in a dedicated binder which is located in the control room, safety office and the training room.  The plan describes the evacuation procedures, the emergency actions to take, individual responsibilities during an emergency, and the appropriate notifications and contacts to make for specific types of emergency events.  Plant evacuations are initiated by activating an audible signal (horn).  The signal can be activated from an outside alarm station or from the main office.   The plan is reviewed and coordinated with the Kern County Fire Department on a periodic basis.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response team made up of operating/maintenance personnel and a team coordinator (Safety and Environmental Supervisor).  Team members receive annual training on their assigned responsibilities in the ERP and the appropriate levels hazardous waste and emergency response operations (29 CFR 1910.120 ?HAZWOPER?).  The team has emergency action plan drills and exercises at least annually and hands-on drills with the emergency equipment periodically. \n\nMaintenance and testing of the emergency equipment is scheduled in the facility?s computerized maintenance management system and performed by the maintenance personnel at the appropriate interval.  \n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\nPlanned changes to improve safety include: 1) Conducting a PHA revalidation for the facility in 2006; and 3) Continuing the effort to review/update the facilities operating procedures."
