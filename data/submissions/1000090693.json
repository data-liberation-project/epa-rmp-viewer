We react steam and methane (natural gas) to form hydrogen gas, which we then purify and distribute through a pipeline, to a nearby steel plant.  In addition to the hydrogen that we produce on-site, we also have two cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage vessels that are connected to the pipeline, which supplement the hydrogen supply to our customer. \n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\n\n\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA; \n\nHydrogen,  which is produced for offsite customer use.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\n\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment. This policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\n\n\n\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible CareA&reg; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Ecorse, MI facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place. This program is built around process safety concepts such as:\n\n- Technical documentation of Process Safety Information, describing the physical properties of the hazardous substances, the safety systems in place to cont"

Following is a description of some of these safety features.\n\n\n\nThe Hydrogen production and storage systems have automatic shut-off devices and relief valves to handle unexpected rises in temperature or pressure. Safety controls, including warning alarms, automatic shutdown systems and leak detectors, provide multiple layers of protection. Continous monitoring of pressure in vessels and piping identify potential problems. \n\n\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Ecorse H2 facility accident history indicates continuous safe operation of our covered chemical process over the last five years. There were no covered process releases that resulted in an EPA RMP recordable accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Programs\n\n\n\nLinde has an emergency response program in place to minimize the effects of accidental release of regulated substances on employees, the public, and the environment"

Linde employees will respond to minor incidents.\n\n\n\nFor other than minor incidents, Linde has in place an emergency response plan in coordination with the Ecorse Fire Department. The plan requires that the Ecorse Fire Department be called for any  incident on site related to fire, spills, or release of the covered chemical.\n\n\n\nAll facility employees are trained in their role in the emergency plan and emergency drills are conducted at least annually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLinde has a commitment to safety that is expressed in a company-wide goal of \"Zero/Zero\", which means zero accidents and zero injuries or illnesses at each and every location. We look to constantly improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees.\n\n\n\nThere are currently no major projects for safety improvement that have reached the planning stage."
