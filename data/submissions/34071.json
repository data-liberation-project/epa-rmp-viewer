      "SummaryText": "Rabun Apparel, Inc. uses chlorine to treat wastewater from textile bleach and dyeing operations.  The chlorine operations consist of two 2,000 pound cylinders containing chlorine liquefied under pressure.  Chlorine from the cylinders is piped to the water treatment system to provide disinfection.  The maximum amount of chlorine stored on site is 13,000 pounds. Based on criteria specified in Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 (CAAA), the facility is required to develop and implement this Risk Management Plan meeting Program 3 requirements.\n \nThe worst case release scenario is a failure of one of the two chlorine cylinders when it is full, resulting in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine followed by vapor cloud dispersion.  This worst-case scenario was recommended by Georgia Environmental Protection Division in their letter to the facility dated October 1, 2001, and included Appendix C.  The distances to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L under worst-case and alternate scenarios were calculated using U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) model, RMP*Comp Version 1.07.\n  \nRabun Apparel, Inc. has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings-in-place.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan was submitted to the EPA on a diskette on June 15, 2004.  A copy of the information submitted is included in Appendix A."
