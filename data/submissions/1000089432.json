      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPretium Packaging, LLC is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our Manchester Pa. facility. It is our policy to implement controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the York County Office of Emergency Management and the local fire department to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source And The Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facilities main activity is the production of blow molded, in-line fluorinated, HDPE containers. We have a concentrated mixture of Fluorine gas that gets blended to 1.0% Fluorine (F2) and 99% nitrogen. (N2) This is used during the blowing process when producing the containers.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program And The Chemical Specific \n\n  Prevention Steps. \n\n\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. We have one process which is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and we have an air operating permit, 67-03027 from the Pa Dept. of Environmental Protection. The following sections describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPretium Packaging maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nPretium Packaging conducts periodic studies to ensure th"

The study is performed by a team of experienced, qualified personnel with expertise in the process and equipment, and revalidated every three years,or when any major changes would be made to the covered process.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purpose of conducting activities and routine tasks within the covered process, Pretium Packaging maintains and uses written operating procedures. These procedures control the various modes of operation such as start up, shutdown, normal operations, and emergency procedures. The procedures are readily available to operators involved in operating and maintaining the in line fluorination process.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nPretium Packaging has a training program in place to ensure that employees that operate the components of the fluorination process are competent in the procedures associated with them. Refresher training is completed as specified in the procedures.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nPretium Packaaging performs documented maintenance and operating checks  to ensure proper operations. Process equipment covered by these checks includes, tanks, pumps, piping, and operating parameters. Any equipment or operating deficiencies identified by these checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. Maintenance is performed by trained personnel with previous experience in maintenance practices.\n\n\n\nManagement Of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Pretium Packaging to manage any changes to the process, and equipment of the covered process. Operations, maintenance, and any other personnel whose job tasks are affected by and changes or modifications are made aware of, and given any necessary training to deal with the modification or change. Procedures are updated accordingly after a change is made.\n\n\n\nPre-start up Reviews\n\nPre start up reviews are conducted after any changes or modificati"

These reviews confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start up prior to placing equipment back into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nPretium Packaging will conduct periodic audits to ensure the provisions set forth under the RMP and PSM requirements are being implemented. Any corrective actions required as a result of these audits will be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nPretium Packaging will promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release at the facility. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective measures that would prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports will be retained at the facility for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nPretium Packaging is committed to making process safety management and accident prevention a team effort. Employees are encouraged to express their views on accident prevention and can participate in process safety management activities. Employees have full access to all information of the facility's RMP and PSM requirements, including information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nPretium Packaging, on occasion, will hire contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and/or construction. A safety performance evaluation of the contractor is conducted. Pretium has a policy of informing contractors of known hazards related to the contractors work and the covered process. Contractors are also informed of all procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of fluorine occur at the facility.\n\n\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Manchester facility of Pretium Packaging has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases. As a result of release prevention programs, the Manchester facility has had no accidental "

Emergency Response Plan\n\nPretium Packaging maintains a written emergency evacuation plan for the safety of all employees in the event of an accidental release at the facility. The plan includes a complete procedure for evacuation of the plant. Pretium Packaging employees do not respond to the emergency. Local emergency response agencies would be contacted to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTo enhance our continuous improvement and maintain safety awareness, safety information and pertinent reminders are discussed at shift start-up meetings each day and procedures are reviewed as needed. Self evaluations are also performed and employee feedback is strongly encourage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
