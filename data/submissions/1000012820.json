      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nThe E&J Gallo Winery, Livingston, Calif. Is located at 18000 West River Road in Merced County, California.  The facility crushes grapes in order to produce wine and distilled spirits.  These products are stored prior to shipment to another Gallo facility for bottling and distribution.\n\nThe E&J Gallo Winery, Livingston became OSHA Star certified on 4-12-02. The Livingston Winery has successfully recertified as a Star site in 2005 and 2009.\n\nThe facility operates anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to provide product cooling.  Refrigeration systems have storage vessels (receivers) sized to contain all the liquid ammonia in the system, with additional capacity for thermal expansion.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop heat transfer system.  Ammonia moves through the system due to pressure differences produced by the compressors.  A brief description of the ammonia refrigeration cycle follows:\n\n1.  The receiver vessel stores liquid ammonia under pressure.  High pressure liquid ammonia flows from the receiver through liquid lines to the expansion valve, which partitions the pressure and temperature.  Liquid ammonia at reduced pressure and temperature is then piped into the chiller shell.\n\n2.  Product is circulated through sealed stainless steel tubing within the chiller shell.  Heat from the warm product transfers through the tubing walls to the cooler refrigeration, causing liquid refrigerant to boil off as low pressure vapor.  The rate of vaporization, and thereby the cooling of product, is determined by the amount of pressure in the chiller as controlled by a back pressure regulator, and suction from the compressors.\n\n3.  The compressors draw the low pressure vapor from the chiller, compress it into high pressure vapor, and discharge to the evaporator condenser (cooling tower).\n\n4.  In the evaporative condenser, ammonia vapor flows through tubing which is sprayed with water and located within fan driven air f"

The ammonia condenses back to a liquid which drains by gravity to the receiver vessel.\n\nIn addition to ammonia refrigeration systems, the facility uses anhydrous ammonia to adjust the pH of process water.\n\n\nAmmonia - Processes in Federal RMP Program level 3:\n\nRefrigeration System #1    -     Capacity 4808 gallons @ 80% = 3846 gallons = 19,809 lbs\nRefrigeration System #2    -     Capacity 3024 gallons @ 80% = 2419 gallons = 12,459 lbs.\nRefrigeration System #3    -     Capacity 5000 gallons @ 80% = 4000 gallons = 20,600 lbs\nRefrigeration System #4    -     Capacity 14698 gallons @ 80% = 11758 gallons = 60,556 lbs   (Plants 4, 5,10, 11,  & 12)\nRefrigeration System #6    -     Capacity 2829 gallons @ 80% = 2263 gallons = 11,655 lbs    (Plant 6)\nRefrigeration System #7    -     Capacity 3010 gallons @ 80% = 2408 gallons = 12,401 lbs    (Plant 7)\nRefrigeration System #8    -     Capacity 9030 gallons @ 80% = 7224 gallons = 37,204 lbs    Plants 8, 9, & 13)\nProcess Water Ph Adjustment System    -    Capacity 12500 gallons @ 80% = 10625 gallons = 56,857 lbs\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nIn the five years prior to this submission, the E & J Gallo Winery at Livingston has experienced one ammonia incident with a release of 882 lbs. of ammonia.  This incident resulted in the evacuation of plant personnel for a period of time of about 3 hours.  There wer no injuries resulting from this event.\n\nTOXIC WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\nThe worst case release scenario was determined in accordance with requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program.  This requires modeling the offsite consequences of a total catastrophic failure of the largest storage vessel, with all product within the vessel dispensing into the air within ten minutes.  For the Livingston Facility, the worst case scenario involves the refrigeration system #4 releasing its entire ammonia content of 5"

      "SummaryText": "6,857 lbs. in a 10 minute period.  This is an unrealistic scemario and highly unlikely to ever occur.  Among other things, it does not take into account the plan's safety programs and specific operational and prevention programs.\n\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nAmmonia - An alternative release scenario would involve damage to liquid ammonia piping at a chiller due to contact from motorized equipment in the area.  If damage was sufficient to cause a failure, it could occur at a flange due to bolt failure and result in a 1 square inch opening.  The release of liquid ammonia from the opening could be expelled into the air and onto surrounding surfaces.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\nThe E&J Gallo Winery employs refrigeration mechanics, supported by Engineering.  The refrigeration system is maintained through the implementation of a scheduled preventive maintenance program based upon standard industrial practices, and many years of practical experience and RETA Certification of Refrigeration Technicians.\n\nEmployees required to operate ammonia refrigeration equipment receive training specific to their assigned duties.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\nThe facility coordinates emergency response through the Safety Department.  In the event of a reportable chemical release, notification will be made to the appropriate agencies including the Merced County Environmental Health Department, the State Office of Emergency Services, and the Federal National Response Center (as appropriate).\n\nGallo management and members of the in-house emergency response team will respond to the site, and work with public emergency response personnel in mitigating the problem.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE:\nThe Management of Change procedure will require evaluation of new construction and modifications to existing ammonia and sulfur dioxide systems to determine the likehood of an effect on safety.  Changes espected to have a significant safety effect on quantity, systems, or procedures will be referred to the a"

The speicfic items the Risk Management Plan will be re-examined and compliance documented.  The team reviews these systems will consist of personnel from Engineering, Instrumentation, Maintenance, and Operations.  The last audit was completed 2-19-09 and it was conducted by the Cal/OSHA VPP Team.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\nHazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) were performed for ammonia systems (in 2007) and sulfur dioxide system (in 2005 and 2010 is in progress).  The study teams were composed of engineering, maintenance, Operations, and management personnel from E&J Gallo Winery, Livingston.  As a result of these studies, numerous improvements were made to existing systems, and included in renewal and upgrade projects.  These improvements were completed prior to submission of the Risk Management Program document."
