      "SummaryText": "Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled :\r\nThe Lima facility, which began operation in October 1993, is situated on approximately 13 acres located between INEOS Chemicals and Husky Refinery.  The facility consists mainly of an administration building, manufacturing/technical building and four tank farms.\r\n \r\nThe main products manufactured at the Lima facility are called chelates.  Chelates are chemical compounds that have the ability to complex or interact with metal ions like calcium and iron and change the property of the metal ion.  For example, chelates will prevent hard water metal ions like calcium from forming precipitates and scale. Because of their unique ability to chelate metals, these chelate products are used in numerous household cleaners, personal care products, photographic processing and a host of industrial applications like pulp and paper manufacture, latex polymerization and energy production to name a few.\r\n \r\nThe Lima facility creates all of its products through hydrocyanic acid ('HCN') chemistry.  The facility takes HCN, which is a co-product in the manufacturing of acrylonitrile, from the adjacent INEOS Chemicals facility.  The HCN is received through a pipeline from the INEOS Chemicals facility and is piped into reactors.  The HCN is reacted immediately upon entering the reactors with various raw materials to produce the different chelates and other products.\r\n \r\nThe Lima facility handles five regulated substances above the threshold quantities - HCN, ethylenediamine ('EDA'), formaldehyde solution, aqueous ammonia, and acetaldehyde (ACH).  HCN is not 'stored' on-site - it is taken from the INEOS Chemicals pipeline and placed directly into process vessels.  EDA is received in tank trucks and occasionally rail tank cars and is stored on-site in two 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  EDA is used as a raw material in the process.  Formaldehyde is received in tank trucks and is stored in three 30,000 gallon storage tanks.  Formaldeh"

      "SummaryText": "yde is also used as a raw material in the process.  Aqueous ammonia is a raw material in one process and a co-product in two other processes.  It is stored in one of three storage tanks (one 50,000 gallon; two 30,000 gallon), depending on which process it is associated with.  Aqueous ammonia is delivered and shipped in tank trucks and pipeline to INEOS Chemicals.  ACH is received in tank trucks and is stored in one 10,000 gallon storage tank.  ACH is used as a raw material in the process.  \r\n \r\n \r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios:\r\nThe Lima facility has reviewed all the covered processes at the facility to determine which Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS) would be reported.  All scenarios were calculated using either the RMP*Comp software or the calculations and tables contained in the OCA Guidance.  All assumptions made in the OCA guidance (i.e. wind speed and stability, release elevation, etc.) were used in the scenario evaluation.  Based on the number of buildings and structures surrounding the plant, urban topography was used in all modeling.  In each ARS evaluation, the facility chose to consider 'worst case' type conditions (i.e. response teams taking longer than expected, etc.)Distances of impact areas were plotted and measured using Google maps distance measurement tool. \r\n \r\nThe Worst Case Scenario, which involves a toxic release from the cyanide weigh tank (a tank used to verify the weight of HCN prior to being placed in the reactor) results in offsite impacts on neighbors, a public recreation area (the Rotary River Walk) and industrial facilities.  This scenario takes into consideration administrative controls that limit the amount of HCN in the weigh tank, which include operating procedures, operator training, computer interlocks and redundant monitoring systems.  These controls limit the weight of HCN in the weigh tank, which has a capacity of 5,800 pounds, to the maximum charge weight of 2,"

      "SummaryText": "900 pounds.  In addition to the administrative controls, a containment dike, considered passive mitigation, would control the release as the HCN is liquefied by refrigeration.  This concrete dike acts to control the release to the atmosphere because it reduces the surface area of the release and thus reduces the release rate.\r\n \r\nThe ARS for HCN involves a toxic release caused by a gasket leak on the feed pump from the HCN weigh tank to the reactor.  The feed pump creates a flow rate that averages approximately 20 lb/min.  The gasket leak would allow approximately 80 lbs of the flow to be released into the diked area.  Due to HCN monitoring equipment located around the weigh tank, the control room operators would know immediately that an HCN leak existed and could shut the pump down and close all necessary valves from the control room.  It is assumed the release can be stopped and the system isolated within 10 minutes.  All of the material released would be contained in the containment dike around the weigh tank and weigh tank pump because the HCN is liquefied by refrigeration.  This reduces the surface area of the release and thus reduces the release rate to 11 pounds/minute.  The release would have offsite impacts on the industrial facilities adjacent to the facility, but would not impact other public or environmental receptors and based on the calculations and modeling program the impact area 0.2 miles which would impact industrial neighbors; however would not impact and environmental or public receptors.  \r\n \r\nThe ARS for EDA involves a toxic release caused by total failure of the offloading hose from the rail car to the storage tank.  The rail car offloads from the top and is pressurized to assist the pump in offloading.  The failure of the line would allow the EDA to release through the failed hose until the pressure is released and/or the valve on the discharge connection is closed.  It is assumed it will take the response team 30 minutes to accomplish this."

      "SummaryText": "Based on the flow rate of the off-loading and the time factor for response it was calculated that 40,000 lbs of the material released would be contained in the containment dike around the rail car and offloading pump, and thus reduces the release rate to 12.12 pounds/minute based on temperature correction calculation.  The release would have offsite impacts of 0.2 miles, on the industrial facilities adjacent to the facility, however would not impact and environmental or public receptors. EDA Railcar is a Process that we have not done in a number of years, and currently there is no plan to utilize the process.  However, the equipment and connections are still there to do this process and we have no desire to remove this process,to allow for the option based on the availability of EDA via Railcar vs truck.  If we were to restart this process a new PHA and PSSR would be held prior to restarting this process.  This is the reason the PHA is past the 5 year limit and the SOP is past a year old, however discussion of the EDA railcar was discussed as part of the recent PHA, but only to the degree of needing to execute a modified PHA in the event of the reconnection of the railcar option.   \r\n \r\nThe ARS for Formaldehyde Solution involves a toxic release caused by total failure of the offloading hose from the tank truck to the storage tanks.  The tank truck offloads from the bottom of the truck.  The area and process is monitored by the tanker driver and via cctv in the control room.  The response time for active mitigation in the scenario is estimated to be 3 minutes or less.  The release amount is calculated based on the process flow rate of 1,062 lbs/min x 3 min for an amount of 3,186 lbs released to passive mitigation dike containment around the storage tanks and truck offloading area.  Based upon the calculations for 44% solution and using formula B-7, the release rate is calculated to be 2.41 lbs/min; which would take 1,322 minutes to completely vaporize.  The end poin"

The release would have offsite impacts on the industrial facilities adjacent to the facility, but would not impact other public or environmental receptors.  \r\n \r\nThe ARS for aqueous ammonia involves a toxic release caused by total failure of the offloading hose from the tank truck to the storage tank.  The tank truck offloads from the rear of the truck.  It is assumed since the off-loading is a monitored operation that 3000 lbs of the tank truck contents would be released through the discharge line prior to it being shut down.  The release would be contained in the containment dike around the storage tank and truck offloading area, and thus reduces the release rate to 61 pounds/minute.  The release would have offsite impacts of 0.1 miles,  on the industrial facilities adjacent to the facility, but would not impact other public or environmental receptors.\r\n \r\nThe Worst Case Scenario, which involves a flammable release from the acetaldehyde storage tank results in offsite impact of 0.3 miles and would have impact on a public recreation area (the Rotary River Walk) and industrial facilities.  This scenario assumed a 1 PSI over-pressure of the ACH storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The amount of ACH released is 90% of the tank capacity, or 58,950 lbs.  The tank is equipped with Hi-level interlock that shuts the pump down for loading at the 90% tank level.  The site also utilizes administrative controls by maintaining 8,100 lbs in the tank, and required ACH off-loading authorization before any material would be permitted to be placed into the tank.  This product that utilizes ACH has not been manufactured in ~2 years and is currently being reviewed.  Any changes to the process with require and MOC and RMP update. \r\n\r\nThe ARS for ACH involves a flammable release caused by hose leak of the offloading hose from the tank truck to the storage tank.

      "SummaryText": "uck.  It is assumed that either the driver or the offloading operator will be able to activate the tank trucks internal valve within five (5) minutes after the leak begins, as they both are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment, have been trained to activate the internal valve of the tank truck in an emergency and that the internal valve closes properly and stops the leak.  In addition, all safe guards are assumed to function properly.  In calculating the impact it was determined based upon the off-load flow rate and time of release that ~2500 lbs would be released to vapor and/or aerosol (as directed in the calculations) in 10-2.  It was calculated that the QF would be 90 lbs, with an impact distance of 0.1 miles which would impact industrial facilities adjacent to the facility, but would not impact other public or environmental receptors.  \r\n\r\n General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\nThe facility strives to prevent accidental releases through many varied approaches.  First, the facility has complied with the OSHA PSM regulation since the facility was built in 1993.  The facility has applied the spirit of the PSM regulation to all facility activities, not just those covered by the regulation.  This is evidenced by the facilities involvement with the Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care program.  Due to this proactive approach, procedures are already in place and active for the RMP covered processes.\r\n \r\n The facility has many technological prevention steps, which include:\r\n\u00b7computerized control systems\r\n\u00b7computerized interlocks and permissives\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the facility has trained operators running the processes.  Each operator goes through extensive training, including classroom, computer based and on-the-job training prior to becoming certified operators.  To assist the operators in running the plant safely, the facility has many operating procedures.  These procedures direct ope"

The site has a robust and active incident reporting system in which near miss, hazard recognitions are reported and acted upon before a serious event can result.  \r\n\r\nThe facility also has a trained maintenance staff to properly maintain all process equipment.  Maintenance team members perform many tasks, ranging from preventative inspections and testing to calibrations to repairs of equipment.\r\n\r\nKey to the entire prevention program is involving the operators in all aspects of the plant HSE programs.  The Lima facility operators are an integral part in Process Hazard Analyses, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, operating and HSE procedures development and modifications, Managements of Change, Incident Investigations, and many other areas.  Internal and External validation audits and reviews are conducted for ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nThe Lima facility has had no accidental releases as defined by the EPA of listed chemicals from covered processes.  However, did have an exposure incident noted from a covered chemical in a covered process.  No adverse effects were noted from the incident.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nThe Lima facility has a comprehensive emergency response program that follows the National Response Team One Plan guidance.  The facility is prepared to address many types of emergencies, including chemical releases, medical emergencies, and fires.  The facility has three internal alarm systems, a fire alarm, an evacuation alarm and an emergency alarm.  If the event requires off-site assistance, phone calls will be made to the appropriate agencies.  Arrangements have been made with the Shawnee Fire Department to assist with any emergency in which they are needed.
