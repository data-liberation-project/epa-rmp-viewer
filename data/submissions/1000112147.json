Refrigeration is required for controlling air temperature in storage areas. Refrigeration is provided through evaporation of liquid anhydrous ammonia by a heat source.  The evaporated ammonia gas is contained in a closed loop system where it is mechanically compressed back into a liquid state for re-use.  Liquid ammonia is moved by system pressure from storage through piping to locations where refrigeration is needed. \n\nBlues City Brewery is committed to providing a safe working environment. We will achieve this mission by promoting a culture in which employee safety is paramount in each and every endeavor. We will actively promote and maintain the following beliefs in everything we do:\n\n\u2022\tSafety performance is critically important to the success of this company\n\u2022\tConcern for employee safety will be evident and embedded into all phases of our work by design and through the business decisions that we make. \n\u2022\tEach employee is empowered with responsibility for his or her personal safety and the safety of their fellow employees and stakeholders. \n\u2022\tContinuous improvement is a way of life at this facility; we use feedback and experience to refine and build upon our culture to ensure continual forward progress. \n\u2022\tSafety incidents are preventable; we will strive to ensure that our policies, practices, and decisions are proactive on all accounts.\n\u2022\tManagement is responsible for ensuring employees have the knowledge, skills, and equipment necessary to protect themselves and others. \n\u2022\tWe will not be satisfied to simply meet safety compliance standards. \n\u2022\tEvery task must be performed with concern for the welfare of ourselves, fellow employees, our contractors, our visitors, and the community in"
