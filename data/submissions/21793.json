Accidential Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at the Dan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is best demonstrated by the fact that we have not experienced a release of chlorine in the past 20 years.  We have accomplished this by having a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass textile yarn manufacturing, dyeing, finishing, screen printing and sewing of home fashions.  We have one (1) regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is chlorine which is used for water treatment.\n\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our facility is 16,000 pounds.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Filter Plant where chlorine cylinders are connected to chlorinators for water treatment.  In this scenario 2000 pounds of chlorine is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation systems such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  These mitigation systems have the effect of a 55% reduction.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.9 miles from the location is"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has ben no accidental release during this period.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly  inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nDanville's LEPC is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency response plans have been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nImplementaion of the various elements of our acciental release prevention program has shown no major safety considerations."

The scenario involves the release of 1.3 pounds of chlorine per minute.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures and chlorine detector alarms, having the effect of a 55% reduction and shorter response time, are taken into account to calculate the scenario. Under netural weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is 0.1 miles.\n\n4.  General Accidential Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Schoolfield Complex.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment design associated with the chlorine process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our process are identified and controlled efficienctly.  The methodology used to carry out this analyses is What If/Checklist (combined).  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 5/28/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within our co"

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\nTraining\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the chlorine process are competent in the operating  procedures associated with that process.  Refresher training is provided at least every two (2) years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized  training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 09/03/1998.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Dan River Inc. - Schoolfield Complex."
