This document has been\nprepared to satisfy multiple regulations and is governed by the following agencies:\nA? OSHAA?s Code of Regulations, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly\nHazardous Chemicals (PSM)\nA? Federal EPAA?s, Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\nRequirements: Risk Management Programs Under Clean Air Act Section 112(r), Program 3\nRequirements (RMP)\nThe purpose of this document is to:\nA? Increase the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by ensuring\nproper emergency response and mitigation procedures when handling regulated substances.\nA? Assist Merchants Terminal and local government agencies in their communication and\ncoordination efforts to improve facility safety while handling regulated substances.\nThis document addresses Merchants Terminal administrative and operational programs to prevent\naccidents related to regulated substances and to reduce potential risks. The regulated substance of\nconcern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration\nfor warehouse cold storage and dock operations.\nThis Executive Summary contains tables outlining the PSM/RMP sections. It includes the purpose,\nfrequency of use, responsibilities and requirements, and forms for each section of the PSM/RMP\nprogram.\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nMerchants Terminal operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary\nrefrigerant.

Evaporation and condensation are\ndesigned to alter the quantity of energy associated with refrigerant. Compression and expansion are\ndesigned to change the availability of the associated energy. The refrigeration cycle is a closed-loop\nprocess. The ammonia refrigeration cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of\nvaporization for cooling. The refrigeration system utilizes these phenomenons to remove heat from a\ndesired area, and then to discard that heat, through condensation, to an area where it is of no\nconsequence.\nThe Merchants Terminal facility utilizes ammonia refrigeration to cool various storage areas. The\nrefrigeration system contains the following equipment: seven screw compressors, two evaporative\ncondensers, one -43A?F recirculator with pumps, one -25A?F recirculator with pumps, one high pressure\nreceiver, one thermosyphon receiver, six blast cells evaporators, four minus 20A?F penthouse evaporators,\nfour -10A?F penthouse evaporators, two cooler penthouse evaporators, and four dock evaporators.\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nEvery section of the RMP/PSM program must allow for employee participation in its development and\nimplementation. The plan allowing for this participation must be documented. Employees and their\nrepresentatives must have access to all information that is developed, for the Process Safety\nManagement program without regard to possible trade secret status of such information.\nFrequency of Use Responsible Part Requirements\nAll employees especially those new\nto the facility or transferred from\nanother department\nDirector of\nEngineering or\nDesignee\nNotifying all employees of the use of ammonia at the\nfacility.

PSM/RMP COMMITTEE REVIEW FORM\nThis form can be found in the Employee Participation Section of this manual.\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nComplete and accurate written information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and\nprocess equipment is essential to an effective RMP/PSM program and to other aspects such as the\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA). The information to be compiled about the chemicals needs to be\ncomprehensive enough for an accurate assessment of the fire and explosion characteristics, reactivity\nhazards, the health and safety hazards to workers, and the corrosion effects on process equipment as well\nas monitoring and safety related equipment. MSDS information can provide a portion of the required\ndata but other information will be required.\nProcess technology information is also required. This includes information on the amount of hazardous\nmaterial stored and used at the facility as well as operating limits for the process. Diagrams of the\nsystem and information on all of the equipment utilized in the system are required. Piping and\ninstrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are required in the Process Hazard Analysis and are included in the\nProcess Safety Information.\nFrequency of Use Responsible Party Requirements\nUpdate if a change is made and\ntrain operators at least every three\nyears\nDirector of\nEngineering or\nDesignee\nMake available to all employees who work on or near the\nequipment of the ammonia process.\nRelated Form:\nA?
