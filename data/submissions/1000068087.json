II-VI EpiWorks, located in Champaign, Illinois, is part of the OptoElectronics Group of II-VI Incorporated.  The OptoElectronics Group manufactures high-power semiconductor lasers, including single emitters and bars enabling fiber and direct diode lasers, VCSELs for 3D sensing in consumer electronics and automotive applications, and III-V epitaxial wafers to enable higher performance photonic and RF components for consumer, communications, network and mobile applications.\r\nEpitaxial devices consist of nanolayers of semiconductor crystals that are uniformly deposited inside sophisticated deposition tools to form an \"epi-wafer.\" Combining different semiconductor materials and dopants in an epi wafer is the key step in determining the performance capabilities of photonics and RF semiconductor components.\r\nII-VI Incorporated recognizes its responsibilities under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act to handle all Extremely Hazardous Substances safely and to prevent accidental release.  II-VI EpiWorks maintains a Process Safety Management Program which incorporates a prevention program including the use of process safety information, operating procedures, employee training, mechanical integrity, process hazard analysis, management of change, pre-start up reviews, incident investigations, compliance audits, and contractor safety programs.\r\nII-VI is committed to maintaining the highest regard for health, safety, and the environment wherever it operates in the world.\r\n\"At II-VI Incorporated, the health and safety of our employees are a primary concern.

Arsine is a liquefied gas. It is stored in DOT-approved cylinders in secure storage rooms. Each cylinder is equipped with protective devices for storage and delivery purposes.  At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, Arsine is a colorless gas.  The toxic properties of Arsine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these cylinders to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to minimize  the threat to nearby members of the community. \r\nAccess to the manufacturing areas of the facility is restricted to authorized employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.  \r\nThis facility complies with the following Federal regulations:\r\n\u00bf\t6  CFR 27 Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS)\r\n\u00bf\t29 CFR 1910.38 Emergency Action Plans (EAPs)\r\n\u00bf\t29 CFR 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\r\n\u00bf\t40 CFR 68 Risk Management Program\r\n\u00bf\t40 CFR 264, Subpart D; 40 CFR 265, Subpart D; and 40 CFR 279.52 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Contingency Planning Requirements \r\nII-VI EpiWorks employs several different controls to prevent accidental releases. Arsine cylinders are contained in a secure vault; access to this vault is restricted to authorized employees. Each cylinder in service is placed in an approved cabinet that is under vacuum and exhausted through ducting. All Arsine piping is double-walled and has welded joints.
