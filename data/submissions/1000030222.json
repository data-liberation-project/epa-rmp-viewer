      "SummaryText": "The Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40CFR Part 68) is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from the accidental release of hazardous substances. The Risk Management Program Rule addresses over 100 chemical substances, 77 of which are acutely toxic and 63 are flammable gases, and the accidental release of these substances. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)estimates that over 100,000 sources are covered by the rule, including chemical manufacturers and wholesalers, certain retailers, potable water treatment systems, wastewater treatment plants, ammonia refrigeration systems, and federal facilities.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande City Water Treatment Plant (WTP) falls under this regulation because of the on-site storage of chlorine.  The amount of chlorine stored is above the threshold limit specified by the USEPA thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation. Rio Grande City personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed an Accidental Release Program Plan (ARPP) that contains the following required information.\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nA hazards assessment that establishes the worst case and alternate release scenarios and their impact on the population and the environment (40 CFRSubpart B)\r\n\r\nA prevention program that includes safety information, a hazards review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits and incident investigation (40 CFRSubpart C)\r\n\r\nAn mergency response plan (40 CFRPart 68 Subpart E)\r\n\r\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that have been implemented at the Rio Grande City WTP.\r\n\r\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThe emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.

In the event of a release, plant staff will contact the Rio Grande City Fire Department, relaying information regarding the release prior to implementing plant evacuation to a location outside the plant gates, awaiting the fire department to inform its personnel of all information about the release and to provide assurance that the plant has been totally evacuated.\r\n\r\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe WTP uses chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process. The plant regularly has a storage maximum quantity of 4 one-ton cylinders of chlorine at its facility that is stored outside.  This is above the the threshold limit of 2,500 pounds set by the EPA.\r\n\r\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThree raw water pumps on the bank of the Rio Grande River discharge into a terminal reservoir located at the WTP. From there, three raw water pumps convey water from the terminal reservoir into a rapid mix chamber, then the flow splits to two identical flocculation basins, two identical sedimentation basins and then the flow combines to supply four dual media filters. The water then goes into a ground storage tank. Three high service pumps take suction from the ground storage tank to supply the distribution.  \r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide is added in the raw water line after the terminal reservoir. Gas chlorine and liquid ammonium sulfate are added in the raw water line ahead of the rapid mix chamber.  Post disinfection with gas chlorine and liquid ammonium sulfate is applied ahead of the ground storage tank. Two backwash pumps take suction from the ground storage tank to backwash the filters.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande City WTP accident history was reviewed from January 2012 to August 2012 since the plant went into operation January 2012.  During this period, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Res"

The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  Plant operators are required to make rounds for inspection and monitoring of the plant's processes every hour.  Accordingly, plant staff will detect any releases of chlorine and the Fire Department is trained to respond to the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes:  (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emergency, (2) information about the plant's evacuation plan and (3) a detailed description for the emergency responders' plan for handling such as an emergency.\r\n\r\nThe Rio Grande City Fire Department has been designated to provide emergency responders and equipment, and will assume Incident Command upon arrival to the plant's emergency.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nThe water treatment plant will continue to train plant personnel in chlorine safety procedures by attending classes and safety meetings.
