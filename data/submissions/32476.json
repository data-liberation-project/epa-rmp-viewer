      "SummaryText": "Phillip Q. Maiorana Wastewater Plant\n6301 West Erie Avenue\nLorain, OH 44053\n\nThe P.Q.M. Plant in the City of Lorain serves the sewer customers on the west side of Lorain and a portion of Amherst Township.  The population served is about 15,000 and growing.  The treated water is discharged into Lake Erie after being disinfected with chlorine.  The plant has been in service since 1988.\n\nAPPLICABILITY\n\nThe P.Q.M. Plant has liquid chlorine in average inventory from 1000 to 5000 pounds.  This chlorine is contained in one-ton cylinders.  The maximum storage used would hold 8000 pounds.  Additionally, there are public receptors in the off site area.  Therefore, the plant is subject to program 3 requirements of 40CFR68.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere has been no release of chlorine in the past five years at the P.Q.M. Plant.\n\nSAFETY AND PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe P.Q.M. Plant has chlorine leak detectors located in the cylinder storage room and feeder rooms.  These detectors have both visual and audio alarms;also, they are linked to the main computer and send an alarm and print out a record of that alarm.  These units are tested monthly and inspected several times during the day; this system would minimize the amount of chlorine that would leak.  The material safety data sheet is located in the MSDS station in the maintenance garage and available to all Operators.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW AND OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nWe are dedicated to plant safety for the good of the public and all employees.  We update the emergecny contingency plan at least once a year.  Ths plan contains a section to instruct the Operators on how to handle different chlorine situations.  The Operators also have a manual for standard procedures that was prepared by the design engineer, CT Consultants.\n\nTRAINING\n\nEach Operator is given on the job training.  All Operators are Class III certified and have been schooled and tested on the use and safety of chlorine.  Additionally, the employees are given drills and train"

Books and videos on chlorine safety\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nAll equipment is inspected several times a day visually.  The flex lines are replaced once a year.  If ever a leak would occur, we have parts readily available on site for replacement and emergencies.  The maintenacne program is followed either by the WEF MOP 11 or the manufacturers recommendations.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA leak event at the P.Q.M. Plant is unlikely.  We partake in good safety and maintenance practices.  All employees are well trained and fully respect  the potential danger of chlorine.  In the event of any leak, they are trained to respond quickly which would minimize the quantity that may escape.\n\nSafety is a well-coordinated effort between management and the employees.  We take our chlorine system serious and will continue to improve and update our safety procedures into the future.  This is why we have never had any chlorine leak events at the plant since its inception.  We expect to continue this good record.\n\nFacilty Name:   Phillip Q.
