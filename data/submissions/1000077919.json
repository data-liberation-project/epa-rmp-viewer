LACC has identified potential release scenarios and taken care to develop operating procedures to monitor and address potential releases as well as defined emergency response plans in the event that an incident occurs.\n\n\n\nLACC manufactures ethylene in an ethane cracking process.  The regulated substances handled above the reporting threshold include propylene, chlorine, ethylene, ethane, 1,3-butadiene, butane, butene, pentane, propane, and methane.  \n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are addressed in LACC's programs and procedures.  The LACC prevention program includes site procedures related to mechanical integrity, employee participation, hot-work permitting, and contractor management.  Operating procedures have been developed and management of change procedures track changes that may affect any process safety information, process hazard analysis, and / or operating procedures.  A pre-startup safety review is also conducted per the site procedure to ensure the site processes are adhered to and employees and / or contractors are trained on the process they will come in contact with.  LACC has site procedures to address routine compliance audits and evaluations against site procedures and will conduct third-party audits every three years, as required.   In the event an incident does occur, a site incident investigation procedure is utilized to look at the root cause of the incident and develop corrective actions to be implemented to prevent the reoccurrence of a related incident.\n\n\n\nAs the facility is a newly constructed unit, LACC has no five-year accident history.\n\n\n\nLACC has an emergency respons"

The site maintains a trained emergency response team that includes the use of a response trailer outfitted with necessary response equipment, a fire engine, and has coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Mutual Aid organization should an emergency need outside intervention.  LACC has also participated in mock training drills utilizing National Incident Management System (NIMS) training to ensure that site personnel are trained on the activation of site incident command structure and function.\n\n\n\nLACC has planned changes to improve safety which include the implementation and use of an Electronic Training System.  Also, LACC is in the process of developing and implementing a state of the art computerized system to track pre-startup safety reviews, management of change, process safety information, and mechanical integrity.\n\n\n\nThe flammable gas worst-case release scenario involves ethylene and has an estimated distance of 0.5 miles reaching an estimated population of 105 people and 42 housing units within this distance."
