      "SummaryText": "Brook & Scenic, LLC operates a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) processing facility at the Scenic View dairy location that generates RNG from recovered biogas emitted from manure digesters. The Digesters generate biogas which is fed into a cleanup and upgrading facility to create RNG. The RNG is created by increasing the methane content by removing water vapor, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other impurities. After upgrading, the RNG is compressed and loaded into transportation trucks for delivery to an injection point where it enters a commercial supply pipeline. The RNG transportation trucks are referred to as a \u0093virtual pipeline\u0094. The RNG is also known as biomethane. RNG is pipeline quality natural gas nearly identical to traditional natural gas and can be used for heating, cooking and other processes.\n\nMethane (CAS 74-82-8) is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Planning (RMP) Rule, 40 CFR 68, as a flammable substance. The RMP Rule has an evaluation threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs for methane at a single applicable site. At the Scenic View facility, the maximum quantity of methane stored or processed at one time is 36,000 lbs. This exceeds the 10,000 lb threshold for methane in the RMP Rule, requiring an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) for methane as a flammable substance. The facility is located in a rural area typified by generally flat terrain with essentially no obstructions to wind in and around the facility. As the facility is subject to Subpart B of the RMP Rule and is considered a Program 3 applicable facility for methane. The OCA for methane at the facility includes the worst-case release from the virtual pipeline RNG trailer truck loading posts. Endpoint distance for these effects of a vapor cloud explosion do not depend on assumed temperature, humidity, or wind. Rather, per the OCA guidance, a TNT-equivalence model is used. The offsite consequence analysis for the worst-case scenario is performed using the EPA m"

      "SummaryText": "odel, RMP*Comp, the OCA guidance methodology and assumptions for TNT equivalence are incorporated to calculate the endpoint to the 1 psi overpressure caused by a vapor cloud explosion of a specified quantity of a flammable substance. RMP*Comp is the US EPA developed and maintained OCA model and was designed to perform the offsite consequence analysis required under the RMP Rule using conservative methods to calculate the hazard endpoint for a distance to the endpoint. The endpoint distance to the 1 psi overpressure represents the maximum is 0.2 miles measured from the truck loading area. The only potential public receptors within the 0.2 mi range are due to an adjacent farm facility.  An alternate case scenario (ACS) was evaluated for a hose leak from a truck loading operation which could generate a vapor cloud fire.  The results indicated a 0.1 mi range to the lower flammability limit but did not impact any public receptors.\n\nThe primary process safety hazards identified by the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study include toxic gas exposure from H2S and overall flammable / explosive hazards from the methane within the system. In order to ensure safe operation of the process facility equipment, a Process Safety and Risk Management program. This program helps identify, and control process safety related hazards to personnel and the environment. The process safety program includes the following main elements:\n\u0095 Employee Participation\n\u0095 Process Safety Information\n\u0095 Process Hazard Analysis\n\u0095 Operating Procedures\n\u0095 Training\n\u0095 Contractor Safety\n\u0095 Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\u0095 Mechanical Integrity\n\u0095 Hot Work Permit\n\u0095 Management of Change (MOC)\n\u0095 Incident Investigation\n\u0095 Emergency Response & Planning\n\u0095 Compliance Audits\nThe process safety management program is supplemented by an occupational safety program to help manage other safety and environmental hazards based on applicable regulations and codes.
