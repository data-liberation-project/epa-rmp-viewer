Our commitment is demonstrated by the capital and human resources invested in our accident and accidental release prevention/mitigation programs.  Enable Midstream's mitigation efforts include: personnel training; safety engineered design; thorough process hazard analyses; compliance audits; management of change; contractor oversight; and planned equipment installation/operation/maintenance of our processes, just to name a few.  Enable Midstream's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, gas plant personnel are trained to follow Enable Midstream's emergency response operating procedures in an effort to safely avert further release and minimize the impact to public and environmental receptors.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MCCLURE NATURAL GAS PROCESSING PLANT AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n    \n\nThe McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant, located at 9210 N. 2080 Road, Butler, Oklahoma 73625 in Custer County, Oklahoma, operates a cryogenic expander plant with refrigeration compression to assist in extracting liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  Plant products include pipeline quality natural gas-primarily methane-and natural gas liquids (NGL) comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The part of the process that was selected  to represent all regulated flammable substances at the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant which could contain a regulated flammable substance above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n    \n\n?

It is noteworthy that the McClure Plant follows applicable laws set forth in OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n    \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n    \n\nThe Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance in this Program Level 1 Gas Plant is a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing the ethane-plus NGL mixture.  For Worst Case Scenario calculations, the full inventory capacity (100% maximum tank capacity of 109,983 gallons) of this tank are assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1 psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.602 miles or ~1060 yards.  Additionally, although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for active or passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating or calculating the WCS for the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant.  \n\n    \n\n   \n\n    \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n    \n\nThe following is a summary of the accidental release prevention program in place at the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant.

Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the gas plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the gas plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n    \n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.

The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n    \n\n    Release Detection\n\n?    Hydrocarbon area detectors with alarms and shutdowns.\n\n?    High/Low process alarms and shutdowns.\n\n    \n\n    Release Containment/Control\n\n?    Pressure relief valves that discharge to a flare header to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\n?    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n?    Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature, high level).\n\n?    Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptable power supply for process control system).\n\n?    Atmospheric pressure relief devices.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    Release Mitigation\n\n?    Fire extinguishers.\n\n?    Personnel trained in company emergency action procedures.\n\n?    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\n\n    \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n    \n\nThe McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant has an excellent record of accidental release prevention.  There have been no accidental releases that have occurred that have resulted in offsite effects over the past 5 years.  The following table is a summary of the number of incidents that have occurred at the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant over the past 5 years.\n\n    \n\n            2014-2019\n\n    Number of RMP Events with Onsite Effects        0\n\n    Number of RMP Events with Offsite Effects        0\n\n    \n\n    \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n    \n\nThe McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for safely responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency action response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans a"

      "SummaryText": "nd accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a flammable release occurs. Company personnel are also available to assess post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing and use of emergency action response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency action program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to gas plant processes or lessons learned from other Enable Midstream gas plant facilities.\n\n    \n\nThe overall emergency action program for the McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant is coordinated with the Custer County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the LEPC, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. \n\n    \n\nCHANGES/ PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n    \n\nThe McClure Natural Gas Processing Plant places high priority in resolving findings and recommendations from PHAs, safety audits and incident investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the process and procedures.  The following changes have been completed in response to these types of activities:\n\n    \n\n?    Revisions/enhancements to personnel training programs\n\n?    Revisions/enhancements to contractor safety programs\n\n?    Revisions/enhancements to mechanical integrity programs\n\n?    Revisons/ enhancements to site security and access control\n\n"
