Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nStockPot has a deep concern for the protection of the environment, since through our daily operations we know the importance of clean surroundings.  The company has always made an honest effort to preserve the natural environment and will continue to strive towards improving our efforts in all forms of pollution control; be it water, air, solids, or noise.  We are dedicated to making improvements where we know they will provide positive results.  The environment is a natural resource that should be used, but not abused.  Our experience indicates environmental benefits can only be achieved by actions that have been preceded by scientific thought and facts, trying to avoid emotionalism.\n\n\n\nStockPot's goal is to form a union with our environment that will benefit all of life.  We are dedicated to using the earth's resources efficiently both to avoid waste and limit pollution in all our food processing operations.  We will continue to pursue every reasonable means to preserve the environment for the present and future generations.\n\n\n\nAmmonia safety is a key item in the Plant Safety Plan.  StockPot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nThe Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety program.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.
