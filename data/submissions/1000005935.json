Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nIn this distribution facility, we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, which are considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine and sulfur dioxide valuable as commodity chemicals also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the training of our personnel.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute\u00c2\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of our immediate neighbors.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the primary purposes of this facility is to repackage and distribute chlorine and to distribute sulfur dioxide to water treatment facilities and general industry.  We also manufacture sodium hypochlorite (bleach) as a byproduct of the chlorine repackaging operation.  Chlorine is received by rail car and sulfur dioxide is received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and ton containers.  No packaging of sulfur dioxide is done at this facility, but both sulfur dioxide and chlorine containers are cleaned and tested here.  Chlorine from rail cars is used to fill DOT approved containers.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The packaging of chlorine and manufacture of sodium hypochlorite is subject to RMP Program Level 3.  \n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention st"

This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution Process of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.\n\nA summary of our Prevention Program\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION \u00c2\u00bf Our facilities maintain current copies of Material Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous chemicals stored including Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  In addition, this facility has current copies of all relevant Chlorine Institute pamphlets.  Much of the information in these pamphlets is applicable to the storage of sulfur dioxide also.  Additional safety information includes Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams, process chemistry for the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite, descriptions of safety systems, and the safe upper and lower limits of process variables.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS \u00c2\u00bf A process hazard analysis has been conducted and it is updated at least every 5 years.  We perform a \u00c2\u00bfZurich Process Hazard Analysis\u00c2\u00bf which evaluates potential risks caused by human and mechanical failures.  In addition, we have used checklists to evaluate risks caused by Human and Source Siting factors.  At least one hourly employee (warehouse personnel or driver) takes part in these analyses.  Corrective or preventative actions discovered during these analyses are documented and addressed in a timely manner.  Results of these analyses are shared with all operators.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES \u00c2\u00bf We have Standard Operating Procedures covering all aspects of handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide at this facility.   Chlorine packaging procedures include information necessary for normal startup, typical operations, emergency shutdown, and the conditions that may make an emergency shutdown necessary.  Operations conducted at this facility are simple batch operations and are easily started and shut down."

      "SummaryText": "TRAINING \u00c2\u00bf All new drivers and operating personnel attend a 5 or 3 day training workshop covering a variety of safety, environmental, and regulatory topics.  Workers at facilities that handle chlorine and sulfur dioxide receive additional training on the hazards, health effects, and operating procedures specific to those chemicals.  Operators directly involved with the repackaging and related operations of chlorine work under the immediate supervision of an experienced operator until they are deemed fit by management to work independently.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY \u00c2\u00bf The Harcros Chemicals Muscle Shoals plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify damage or deterioration before equipment fails.  Daily and longer period checklists are used to assist operators checking critical equipment.  Some equipment is replaced on a periodic basis and others are replaced or repaired when problems are discovered during inspections or normal operations.  This facility only has one person whose primary job is maintenance but all operators take part inspecting, and if qualified, replacing or repairing equipment.  Qualified contractors are used for maintenance activities that require special skills or when otherwise needed.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE - We review all changes to our processes to determine if new hazards are introduced or existing prevention measured are threatened.  Except for replacements-in-kind, all changes are subject to review to ensure that (1) new hazards are not inadvertently introduced, (2) safety consequences resulting from the change are addressed, (3) operators are notified of the change, and (4) training material, process safety information, and operating procedures are updated if required.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW - If a change required updating the"

This review would ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for service before startup.  This review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves as a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION \u00c2\u00bf We have an Incident Investigation SOP which requires operation managers to document and investigate incidents involving injuries and environmental releases, as well as \u00c2\u00bfnear-misses\u00c2\u00bf that could have lead to injuries and releases.  These reports are reviewed by Corporate safety personnel and are shared with all operators at the facility.  Hourly employees take part in all investigations.  Corrective actions proposed as a result of these investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION - Harcros Chemicals encourages employees to be involved in all aspects of process safety management and accident prevention.  Employees participate in process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and management of changes.  Employees have access to all information developed as part of this prevention program and are informed of any changes in process areas.\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS \u00c2\u00bf Our Hot Work procedures requires reviews and a daily permit be issued for any work involving flames or spark producing equipment in process areas.\n\nCONTRACTORS - The Harcros Chemicals Muscle Shoals plant occasionally uses contractors for maintenance and construction.

Five year accident history\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility\u00c2\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon The Chlorine Institute\u00c2\u00bfs Pamphlet 64, Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities.  This plan is reviewed annually and updated when required.  All response team members attend annual refresher training including the use of response equipment and personal protective equipment on simulated leaks.  We work closely with our suppliers, customers, public responders, and The Chlorine Institute to continuously improve our emergency response capabilities.\n\nOur response program is for chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks only.  We will not respond to other types of emergencies but will assist trained public and private emergency response personnel if required.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThis distribution facility was constructed in 1969.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  \n\nHarcros has recently shut done other chlorine packaging plants.
