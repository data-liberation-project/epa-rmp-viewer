This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety\n\n     Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by\n\n     The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards\n\n     of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(osha), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage\n\n     and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our   \n\n     employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n\n\n4.
