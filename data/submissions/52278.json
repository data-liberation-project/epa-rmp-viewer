      "SummaryText": "Hopewell Power Station is a cogeneration plant that produces electricity and process steam for sale.  The facility includes two coal-fired stoker boilers, each equipped with selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) and an over-fire air system for the removal of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  In the SNCR process, nitrogen oxide emissions are reduced by chemical reaction with ammonia, whereby nitrogen oxides are transformed into nitrogen and water.  The ammonia used in the SNCR process is liquid anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in a 15,000 gallon tank with a maximum fill capacity of 12,750 gallons.  The tank, piping system, and safety devices are designed and constructed to comply with applicable federal codes and regulations.  All tank process connections are equipped with internally mounted excess flow valves and a check valve on the liquid fill line to shut off the flow of liquid or vapor should a pipe rupture occur.  The tank is enclosed by a concrete berm and contains chemical sensors to detect small releases.  The tank is also equipped with other safety devices:  pressure relief valves, for overpressure protection; check valves, to shut off the flow of fluid in case of an emergency; an overpressure alarm system; an emergency shut-off system; and pressure, temperature, and level indicators.  The tank working pressure is normally between 50 to 60 psig and a vaporizer helps maintain these pressures.\n\n\n\nHPS has maintained a strong safety and accidental release prevention program.  The facility's ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements.  HPS operating procedures are written and followed with specific detail for safely conducting activities involving the unloading, storage, and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In addition, each employee involved in operating the ammonia process is further trained in emergency operations.  Plant personnel strictly adhere to the written maint"

      "SummaryText": "enance procedures to ensure the mechanical and functional integrity of the tank, piping system, and emergency shutdown systems.  These activities include periodic inspections, testing, and replacement of parts consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations and good engineering practices.  Furthermore, HPS ensures that any changes to the ammonia process or plant equipment and systems are managed by implementing a hazard analysis, a root cause failure analysis, and safety procedures before modifications occur.  HPS has taken great care to ensure the anhydrous ammonia system is properly designed, maintained, and operated.  As a result, HPS has never had a reportable accident concerning the ammonia system.\n\n\n\nUnder the 40 CFR Part 68 requirements, facilities must identify the maximum possible area that might be effected under unspecified catastrophic conditions (the worst-case release scenario).  It further requires facilities to identify a more likely scenario (the alternative release scenario).  EPA's RMP*Computer modeling program was chosen to estimate the distance to toxic endpoint for the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios.  These distances are presented in Sections 2 and 3 of this plan.  The populations within these distances was reviewed after release of 2010 data by US Census Bureau, and no changes were necessary.\n\n\n\nHPS has an emergency response program that has been coordinated with the Hopewell Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  In the event of a release, the program includes immediate notification of local responding agencies, state and federal agencies, the ammonia supplier, and plant management.  The program further includes evacuation procedures and leak isolating procedures, if it is safe to do so.\n\n\n\nBecause the ammonia storage and handling is subject to OSHA's PSM requirements, audits and inspections are performed periodically to identify changes to improve safety.  These changes are evaluated and implemented as required by "
