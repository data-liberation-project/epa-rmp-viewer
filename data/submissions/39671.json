A scenario that is more realistic than the worst case scenario was selected as the alternative release case.\n\nThe alternative release scenario simulates an ammonia railcar transfer line rupture.  The event is assumed to release 6,840 lbs of ammonia during a 20 minute period at a rate of 342 lb.min.  The estimated distance to the toxic endpoint (200 ppm) is 0.3 miles.  This scenario was modeled using RMP Comp (V1.01) and assumed a complete rupture of the liquid transfer hose during a railcar unloading.  The loss was assumed to be for 20 minutes duration with a manual response to close the railcar unloading valve and did not account for the excess flow valve in place on the railcar in order to keep the model conservative.  The estimated residential population within the area is ~4,140 persons.  Public impacts include parks and recreational areas, and major commercial office and industrial buildings.  The institutions, parks, and recreational areas within the 0.3 mile radius from the release source were located using WNY street maps from Map Works, Inc.  No environmental contacts are impacted.\n\nFive Year Accident History - During the five years immediately prior to the date of this report, no accidental releases were experienced at the FMC Corporation Tonawanda Plant under the RMP definition.\n\nPrevention Program - FMC Corporation's Tonawanda Plant has established a comprehensive Safety Management System that strives to identify and eliminate all potential exposures that include, but are not limited to, personal injury/illness, property damage, fires, process incidents, and breaches of security.  The Safety Management System embodies and employs the spirit and intent of the concepts found in the ACC Responsible Care Initiative, the OSHA PSM Standard, all other applicable regulatory standards, and FMC Corporation's Corporate Safety and Industrial Hygiene Policies and strategies.\n\nPrevention of accidental"

The company will provide and maintain safe equipment, processes, procedures, safety training, and will comply with safety regulations.\n\nManagement at FMC Corporation's Tonawanda Plant has authorized specific risk management programs and activities in compliance with EPA's Risk Management Program ruling (40 CFR Part 68) that assesses the hazards of processes which handle or store more than the threshold quantity of substances regulated by the EPA, prevent accidental releases of these hazardous substances, and effectively respond to emergencies if a release occurs.\n\nDescription - FMC Corporation's Tonawanda Plant produces active oxidant products for shipment to external users.  The covered process is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia (CAS Number 07664-41-7). \n\nWorst Case Scenario - RMP regulations require a consequence analysis for worst case scenarios in each regulated process, estimated to present the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint.\n\nThe worst case scenario selected for this process was the complete loss of the contents of one full ammonia railcar of 161,000 lbs within 10 minutes.  The distance to toxic endpoint (200 ppm) is 6.9 miles.  The estimated residential population within the area is ~316,550.  Modeling was performed using RMP Comp V1.01 assuming rural conditions and a wind speed of 1.5 m/sec.  Rural conditions were deliberately chosen to create a more conservative approach as was the F class stability.  Public impacts include schools, residences, hospitals, recreational areas, and major commercial office or industrial areas.  Environmental impacts include state parks and wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, or refuges.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios - RMP regulations require that at least one alternative release scenario be"

The following elements are included in the Safety Management system at Tonawanda:  0. Management Responsibility; 1.
