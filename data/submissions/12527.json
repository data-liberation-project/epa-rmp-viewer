The distance that was calculated from a worst case scenario was  2.4 miles as determined from the RMP Comp Version 1.06 modeling program. The likelihood HAZOP description rating assigned was once in a plant lifetime or less than once in 100 years which equates to virtually impossible. This determination was based on the administrative controls in place, the structural integrity of the tubes, and historical performance of hydrogen chloride in tube trailers for the industry.

      "SummaryText": ". The ISO container is positioned under a fire detection/suppressant sprinkler system. Once a fire is detected the sprinkler system will activate and begin to spray the ISO container manifold and immediate area. The primary purpose of the sprinkler system is to protect the surrounding area from fire. Since Silane is pyrophoric it will continue to produce a flame as long as there is a leak. \nThe ISO container has 2 pneumatically controlled header valves. The operator can remotely shut down the silane product source by cutting the nitrogen supply off that keeps these valves open and therefore stop the flow of silane and the leak out of the manifold connection.\nThe nitrogen that activates the pneumatic valves is supplied through plastic tubing. The choice of this material over a metal type supply piping was intentional. Should a leak of silane occur the heat and flames produced can melt the plastic, cut off the supply of nitrogen and close the pneumatic valves, resulting in the isolation of the product source.       \nIn summary, any of the perceived alternate scenarios that could develop into a silane release can be managed by the Morrisville emergency response plans in place. Silane's pyrophoric property minimizes the dispersion distance. \n\nHYDROGEN CHLORIDE - WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nHydrogen chloride is a toxic product which is received at the Morrisville plant in tube trailers.

Chlorine is a liquefied gas under its own vapor pressure of 85 psig @ 70 degrees fahrenheit. The ton container has a cylindrical shape and lays in the horizontal position. It is typically moved around with a fork truck.  The ton is approximately 7 feet long and has diameter of 24 inches. This container style has been used for decades in industry for chlorine service.  The container has two valves installed at one end - one for vapor withdrawal and one for liquid withdrawal. It also has 6 safety devices - 3 at each end of the container which are temperature activated should the container be exposed to elevated temperatures (greater than 165 degrees fahrenheit).\nThe HAZOP analysis performed on the chlorine system determined the worst case scenario would be the mechanical failure of the ton container.

Air Liquide agrees that this number is the minimum reduction the building enclosure will provide. This value was incorporated in the equation for calculating the endpoint for the worst case scenario. \nThe chlorine ton containers are visually checked,  leak checked , and product weight checked during and after fill by the supplier.

The kit is called a Chlorine B Kit and is manufactured by the Chlorine Institute of America.  Once capped, the container can then be drained of all product and the safety replaced. \nThe contents of the container can also be sent to the scrubber or to another container which will lower the vapor pressure of the chlorine and slow the leak rate substantially.\nPassive mitigation is the fact that the chlorine fill system is contained within a 15,000 square foot building.

This is due to the limited amount of silane that could be  released and also  silane's pyrophoric property as detailed in the previous paragraph.\n\nThe alternate scenario chosen for silane was a  release from the main connection of  the ISO container manifold. This type of release will produce a jet fire. The data used to determine the amount of the silane released and the endpoint came from the Compressed Gas Association Silane Study (release rate) and the Charm Modeling Program, Version 9.1  (endpoint) . These data sources were used to calculate the scenario because of silane's unique pyrophoric properties which limit the use of standard type formulas and assumptions. These calculations determined the entire tube (588 lbs.) would release through the main manifold connection given a mitigation repsonse time of 10 minutes. The reponse time of 10 minutes is a very conservative number. The mitigation steps Morrisville has in place will significantly reduce the time to isolate the leak source and minimize the damage. \n\nThe worst case and alternate case scenarios result in the same amount of product release but the difference is in the hazard condition they produce. The leak from the trailer main manifold connection will produce a jet fire where the worst case scenario was a catostrophic failure of the trailer tube producing a vapor clould explosion. \n\nThe main manifold connection has a 1/2 tubing connected to it which feeds the supply of silane from the ISO container to the silane fill system.  There were several other scenarios in the HAZOP analysis that  were comparable in risk rating but this scenario offered the largest potential product release.\n\nThis silane release scenario will  have several active mitigation measures in place to minimize the consequence of this release"

The committee meets approximately every 2 months.\nThe Morrisville plant has been  ISO - 9002 certified since February, 1994. This is a certification of the quality system performed by an independent third party auditer twice a year. Key elements of this certification include documentation control (e.g., procedures), training, calibration of process equipment, and inspection and testing of product. These same requirements are also critical for chemical process safety making the ISO -  9002 a strong asset where training and control of a process are necessary elements.\nThe Morrisville plant is equipped with a 24 hour, 7 day a week security and fire detection system with  links to local fire and police departments.  \nThe Morrisville plant has had no reportable accidental releases for the last 5 years. Therefore no personnel injuries have been reported. In addition,  the Morrisville plant has had no lost time injuries as defined by OSHA since the plant opened in 1990.\nEvery chemical produc"

      "SummaryText": "t that is processed or stored at the Morrisville plant has a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) on file at the plant. Employee competency on product knowledge is accomplished through MSDS review, specific process training sessions, monthly safety meetings, and standard operating procedures. All of these elements are documented, controlled, and monitored as detailed previously per ISO 9002 requirements and the Hazardous Communication Program.\nStandard operating procedures specify rigid leak testing and package preparation for all products. The primary concern for these steps is safety but the quality of the products must be of the highest level. The primary clientele for the Morrisville plant are electronics customers who use compressed gases in the process of making semiconductor chips. This application demands the purest raw materials be used in the process which includes the compressed gases. Very small leaks invisible to the naked eye or to standard leak testing techniques can be found prior to any introduction of product into a system or final package. This is accomplished by using sophisticated helium leak detection systems which have a far greater magnitude of sensitivity for finding leaks.\n\n\nWORST CASE/ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe following are the worst case and alternate case scenarios that have been formulated for the Morrisville plant products that are subject to the RMP plan. There are three products addressed in this document; silane, hydrogen chloride, and chlorine.\n\nSILANE - WORST CASE SCENARIO\n\nSilane is a flammable gas which Morrisville receives as a bulk product source in an ISO container. An ISO container is very similiar to a standard gaseous tube trailer except that the container has the ability to be removed from its trailer chasis.This mobility allows this type of container to be placed on the deck of a ship for transportation overseas or be transported over land by railroad on a flatbed car. The Morrisville plant leaves the ISO container on i"
