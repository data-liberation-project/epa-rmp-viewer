The RMP for the plant was last submitted in June 2009 and must now be updated and re-submitted to meet the five-year update requirement (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  The RMP must be resubmitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) no later than June 2014.\r\nThe covered process under the RMP rule is the water treatment plant's chlorination system, used for disinfection in the production of potable water. The plant's program is a unified approach that integrates technology, procedures, and management practices to proactively manage the potential risks associated with the plant's storage and use of chlorine.\r\n\r\nI.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nHallsdale-Powell Utility District owns and operates the Melton Hill Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in Powell, Tennessee. For disinfection, the plant uses chlorine, which is classified as an extremely hazardous substance. The threshold quantity for chlorine for process safety management (PSM) applicability (29 CFR 1910.119) is 1,500 pounds. The threshold quantity for risk management plan (RMP) applicability (40 CFR Part 68) is 2,500 pounds. The plant uses and stores chlorine in excess of these thresholds, therefore it is subject to federal requirements including preparation of PSM and RMP programs. These programs are intended to minimize the health risks to employees and the public from the accidental release of chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe Hallsdale-Powell Utility District is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental re"

      "SummaryText": "lease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and audits associated with the chlorination system at the water treatment plant.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  The utility is coordinated with the Rural Metro Fire Department, which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a release of chlorine, and is currently included in the Knox County Emergency Management Agency and the Anderson County Emergency Management Agency emergency response plans.\r\n\r\nII.\tTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at our water treatment plant.  Chlorine is used for disinfection in the production of potable water.  Chlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure.  The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 pounds per square inch).  Chlorine gas is non-flammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials.  Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).\r\n\r\nThe maximum inventory of chlorine at our plant is 16,000 pounds (lbs) or eight one-ton cylinders.  The one-ton cylinder is the largest chlorine storage vessel on-site and all of the containers are located in the Chlorine Room, which is of fire-resistant construction in accordance with the Chlorine Institute specification for chlorine storage facilities.  The chlorination system is a vacuum feed system with safety features such as automatic shutoff during loss of vacuum, chlorine gas detector, and alarm.\r\n\r\nProcess Description:\r\n\r\nThe Melton Hill WTP utilizes chlorine gas to disinfect the potable water produced at the plant. The chlorine is supplied in 2000"

An investigation is initiated as promptly as possible by an incident investigation team, but not later than 48 hours following the incident.  The PSM plan provides a form for documenting an incident investigation. All reports should be retained for a minimum of 5 years. No incident investigations have been required in the last 5 years as there have been no incidents or near misses. The last review of the incident investigation procedures was conducted on June 21, 2012.\r\n\r\nG.\tCompliance Audits\r\nThe Hallsdale Powell Utility District has selected personnel knowledgeable of the plant's chlorination system to conduct compliance audits of the RMP. The RMP rule requires that procedures and practices of covered processes designated as Program 3 be audited for compliance at least every 3 years to verify adequacy and implementation. In addition to an internal review on June 21, 2012 a compliance audit was conducted by CTI Engineers on October 23, 2012. As required by the rule, the two most recent audit reports are kept at the plant.\r\n\r\nH.\tManagement of Change\r\nAny time a design or operational change is anticipated, the change will be completely evaluated and documented prior to and after implementation. The intent is to require safe management of all changes to equipment, storage, procedures, materials, and process chemicals regarding the chlorination system, other than replacement in kind, by identifying and reviewing them prior to implementation.

Each cylinder has two valves - one supplied chlorine gas evaporated from the liquid chlorine inside the cylinder, the other allows withdrawal of liquid chlorine if desired. The Melton Hill plant has two loadcell platforms that accommodate two one-ton cylinders hooked together. The platforms continuously weight the cylinder as gas is withdrawn, and the weights are displayed on the plant SCADA system for the plant operators to monitor. \r\n\r\nThe chlorine gas from the cylinders is drawn under vacuum (for safety reasons) and mixed with potable water before introduction into the treatment process. Normal dosages range from 3 to 5 parts per million, depending on water quality. The amount of free chlorine residual in the finished water is continuously monitored as the water leaves the plant going to the system. It ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 parts per million. Quantity-wise, this equates to about 250 pounds of chlorine fed per day into 7 million gallons of water. Chlorine dosages are varied according to demand, as HPUD is required to maintain a 0.2 ppm at any point in our distribution system.\r\n\r\nIII.\tTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe chlorination system must meet Program 3 prevention program requirements, as the covered process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard under the Tennessee OSHA program.  The following sections briefly review and update the elements of the Program 3 prevention program.  In the past five years, our water treatment plant has taken all the necessary steps to address the requirements of each element of the prevention program as described below:\r\n\r\nA.\tProcess Safety Information\r\nProcess safety information that describes the chemical properties and chemical hazards, operating parameters, and process equipment associated with the chlorination system is kept accurate and complete, as required by the RMP rule.

Process safety information was last reviewed on June 21, 2012.\r\n\r\nB.\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nThe RMP rule requires the update and re-confirmation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for covered processes designated as Program 3 at least once every 5 years. The PHA is conducted by a team familiar with the plant's chlorination system and the PHA technique; they are tasked to review the hazards of the process and to review the adequacy of the safeguards in place. \r\nThis includes checking that all major changes to the process are being reflected in the PHA, evaluating the process safety information to ensure it is accurate and complete, confirming that operating procedures reflect changes and review incident reports. The team's recommendations, resolutions and corrective actions are implemented. The what-if method is used to conduct the plant's PHA. The last PHA was conducted on October 23, 2012. All PHAs are documented and kept at the plant for the life of the chlorination system.\r\n\r\nC.\tOperating Procedures\r\nOperating procedures for the chlorination system include startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, lockout/tagout, confined space entry, hazard communication, respiratory protection, changing chlorine containers, and identification of leaks. The RMP rule requires annual certification that operating procedures are current and accurately reflect the covered process. The most recent review of the operating procedures for the chlorination system was conducted on June 21, 2012. The last revisions were made in June 2014.\r\n\r\nD.\tEmployee  Participation\r\nA comprehensive training program is in place to ensure that the operating staff is competent to operate the plant's chlorination system. The training program covers the PSM plan, operating procedures, health and safety hazards, emergency operations (e.g.,"

Classroom and on-the-job training include review checklists. On-the-job observations are used to confirm understanding. \r\nThe RMP regulation requires that refresher training be provided at least every 3 years and more often if necessary. Formal classroom and field practice training was conducted by Hazmat Personnel and Emergency Responders on May 18, 2011. Refresher training is tentatively scheduled for September 2014. The last review/revision to the training program was conducted on June 21, 2012.  Operating staff training schedules, safety training records, and attendance logs of formal training courses and refresher training are maintained in accordance with record-keeping procedures established by the Hallsdale-Powell Utility District.\r\n\r\nE.\tMechanical Integrity\r\nPreventative maintenance, inspection, and testing of the chlorination equipment are critical to the mechanical integrity and safe operation of the system. The RMP rule requires inspections and testing of process equipment according to a schedule established by the operating staff based on good engineering practices. Inspection/preventative maintenance procedures for the chlorination equipment are provided in the plant's PSM plan and equipment manufacturers' O&M manuals. These are located in the Operator's Control Room. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. The preventive maintenance procedures/schedules were reviewed/revised on June 21, 2012. Equipment inspection/testing are conducted daily, weekly and annual basis, depending on industry practice and manufacturer's recommendations. New Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) were completed on October 23, 2012 and valve numbers were updated the match the new drawings. Using maintenance logs, spreadsheets and the Cityworks"
