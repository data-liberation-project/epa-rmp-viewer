      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nSTX Beef Company, LLC is located in Corpus Christi, Texas.  STX Beef Company, LLC is a leader in developing and implementing new beef processing technologies in an effort to provide customers with the highest possible quality meats and services.  The facility processes beef for distribution to thousands of customers throughout the United States and many foreign countries.  To maintain product quality and freshness, during processing and storage, the inventory is kept either refrigerated or frozen.  Cooling is achieved through the use of three ammonia refrigeration systems containing a significant quantity of ammonia within the system's boundary.\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nSTX Beef Company, LLC is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities. STX Beef Company, LLC believes that the best way to prevent an accidental release is by being proactive in its approach to safety.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. We have an emergency action program that is coordinated annually with the Corpus Christi Fire Department to minimize the potential impacts and notify the public of any actions necessary should an accidental release occur.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe STX Beef Company, LLC Corpus Christi, Texas facility has three ammonia refrigeration systems to provide cooling and cold storage. Ammonia is the only substance present above the RMP threshold quantity. \n\n3. Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps.\nWe are careful to understand the hazards of ammonia and safely manage it. Our policies and programs call for preventing accidental releases, safely mitigating them on-site through early identification if possible and being prepared in the event of an emergency to minimize"

To ensure that a release does not occur, the Plant has developed and implemented an effective release prevention program encompassing the twelve elements of both EPA RMP and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. A risk management team, consisting of qualified personnel located onsite and at regional offices, is accountable for implementation, enforcement and oversight of the above elements of the release prevention program.\nIn addition to the above referenced EPA and OSHA prevention programs, chemical-specific prevention steps include:\n> System instruments and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n> Periodic confirmation of safe process design in accordance with refrigeration industry standards and applicable codes and regulations;\n> Process and chemical-specific operating procedures and training to ensure that the system is operated safely; and\n> Maintenance, inspection and testing in accordance with refrigeration industry standards and manufacturer's recommendations to ensure system integrity.\n\n4. Five year accident history\nIn the last five years, the STX Beef Company, LLC facility has not experienced any significant accidental ammonia releases that resulted in injuries or property damage. The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major anhydrous ammonia release that could have had adverse effects on the public.\n\n5. The Emergency Preparedness and Response\nThe STX Beef Company, LLC recognizes that swift, efficient actions can minimize the potential for injury in the event of an accidental release.  Our emergency preparedness program includes an Emergency Action Plan and training to ensure that employees quickly recognize a release, assess whether they can safely abate it and immediately notify the Corpus Christi Fire Department in the event of an emergency.  We coordinate site emergency response with the Corpus Christi Fire Department to ens"

If such an emergency did occur, plant personnel would contact the Corpus Christi Fire Department, who would dispatch specially trained personnel to the facility to respond and, if necessary, notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection. \n\n6.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety and Maintaining a Safe Operation\nWe have already installed controls and protective systems to meet refrigeration system industry design safety standards and applicable regulations and continually work to safely manage chemical hazards to protect our employees and the community we serve. Each year we will review procedures, maintain equipment, follow safe work practices and coordinate with community emergency responders.  Periodically, we will audit our program, update our Process Hazard Analysis and implement any additional improvements recommended by these evaluations. Based on our most recent evaluation, we will be further improving our mechanical integrity, ventilation, controls and release detection and taking other prevention improvement measures. We continue this process on an ongoing basis."
