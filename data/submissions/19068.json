The Facility Policy\n \n                               The Owners, management, and employees of Mo Valley Ag are committed\n                                to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an\n                                accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the \n                                local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize\n                                the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n                   2.          Facility Information\n\n                                The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers\n                                for sale to farmers.\n                                Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct\n                                application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production\n                                nutrients.\n                                The maximum quantity stored would be 102,000 pounds in our two- 12,000\n                                gallon storage tanks.\n\n                    3.

The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total\n                                              contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.
