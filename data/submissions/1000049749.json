The Offsite Consequence Analysis was performed with the RMP*Comp, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) consequence analysis software program. \r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Arlington Terminal. Because processes at the Arlington Terminal that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nThe Arlington Terminal provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Arlington Terminal accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Arlington Terminal and addresses each accident prevention program element.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe Arlington Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The Arlington Terminal also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nThe Arlington Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Arlington Terminal primarily uses the \"HAZOP\" analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.

All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Arlington Terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nThe Arlington Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Arlington Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nThe Arlington Terminal uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Arlington Terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Arlington Terminal evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Arlington Terminal personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews (PSSR)\r\nThe Arlington Terminal conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Arlington Terminal incorporates qualit"

This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices\r\nThe Arlington Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nThe Arlington Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nThe Arlington Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss,"
