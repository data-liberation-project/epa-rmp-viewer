      "SummaryText": "The Oconee Joint Regional Sewer Authority (OJRSA) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, training, and audits associated with the chlorination system at the water reclamation facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances. The OJRSA is coordinated with the Oconee County Emergency Services (OCES) which will provide highly trained emergency response personnel to respond to a release of chlorine.\r\n\r\nChlorine is the only regulated substance present at the OJRSA Coneross Creek Water Reclamation Facility (CCWRF) above the threshold quantity.  Chlorine is used for disinfection of the treated wastewater prior to discharge to the receiving stream. Chlorine used for gaseous chlorine disinfection is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure. The vapor pressure of stored chlorine is 6.8 atmospheres (99.89 pounds per square inch (psi)). Chlorine gas is nonflammable, but it is a strong oxidizer that can support combustion of other materials. Chlorine is a toxic gas that is considered by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to be immediately dangerous to life and health at concentrations exceeding 10 parts per million (ppm).\r\n\r\nThe gaseous chlorine containers are located in the Chlorine Building, which is of fire-resistant construction in accordance with the Chlorine Institute specification for chlorine storage facilities. The gaseous chlorination system is a vacuum feed system with safety features such as automatic shutoff at the container during loss of vacuum, chlorine gas detection, and alarm."
