This commitment is\ninherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design,\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training associated with the processes at this\nfacility. It is our goal and objective to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of\nregulated substances. If an accidental release were to occur, Brenntag has coordinated emergency response\nactivities with the St. Louis Local Emergency Planning Committee and the St. Louis Fire Department.\n\n2. THE STATIONARY SOURCE & THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED: Our facility's primary activities\nencompass Distribution of chemical products. Currently, there are two regulated substances present at this\nfacility that exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) as defined within 40 CFR 68.130. These substances include\nanhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received in bulk and is blended with water to produce aqua ammonia which is stored in an on-site tank and subsequently packaged in drums and totes and also transported in bulk tanker trailers for delivery to our customers.  \n\n3. THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM: Our facility has taken necessary steps to\ncomply with the accidental release prevention requirements as set forth under 40 CFR Part 68. The\ntwo RMP regulated substances are also listed under OSHA's Process Safety Management Appendix A as set\nforth under 29 CFR 1910.119.  Of these two substances, only the anhydrous ammonia is a PSM covered substance.   The following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are currently in place at this facility.\n\na).

Process Hazard Analysis (PHA's): This facility conducts comprehensive PHA's to ensure that hazards\nassociated with each regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP Analysis \nmethodology is utilized for completion of PHA's. The PHA's are completed by a team of\nqualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations. PHA's are reviewed prior to the\nimplementation of any process change that involves the regulated substance; immediately following an\naccidental release or if an incident has occurred that could have resulted in an accidental release. At a\nminimum, PHA's are revalidation every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed\nin a timely manner.\n\nc). Operating Procedures: For the purpose of safely conducting activities within our covered processes,\nBrenntag maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation\nsuch as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdowns, emergency\noperations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround. Operating procedures are regularly\nevaluated and are accessible to all applicable employees involved within each regulated process.\n\nd).
