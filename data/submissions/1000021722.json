This coordination includes periodic committee meetings with or communications to local emergency response officials, local government officials, community members, and industry representatives.  Shell, Momentive, and Motiva maintain trained and fully equipped firefighting, HAZMAT, and medical/rescue teams capable of managing a broad range of emergency incidents.  Momentive also maintains a 24 hr. communications capability with St. Charles Parish DEP officials, as well as area emergency response organizations (i.e. local fire departments, Sheriff's department, State Police, etc.).  In addition to established lines of communication with area emergency response organizations, Momentive is also a member of the St. Charles Parish Industrial Mutual Aid Association.  Periodic emergency drills are held with the St. Charles Parish DEP, Mutual Aid Organization members, and local emergency response organizations.  Refresher training is also provided to local emergency response organizations on the hazards of regulated substances at the site.\n\nThe St. Charles Parish DEP is responsible for maintaining written plans for the preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery of any natural or technological disaster that may occur in St. Charles Parish. This responsibility includes coordination with neighboring Parishes who may be affected by an emergency incident within St. Charles Parish.  The DEP is also responsible for coordinating the plans and operations of various emergency response agencies in St. Charles Parish such as fire, police, emergency medical services, public works, volunteers and other groups that respond to emergencies. \n\nMomentive (through Shell) maintains a written emergency response program designed to protect workers, public safety, and the environment.

Epichlorohydrin is the only RMP regulated substance stored or processed in amounts greater than threshold quantity in the Resins Unit.\n\n3.  Shipping Unit\n\nThis unit receives and stores feedstocks used in resins production.  Epichlorohydrin is the only RMP regulated substance stored or processed in amounts greater than threshold quantity in the Shipping/Loading area.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nMomentive's ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, detailed training of our employees, and constant emphasis on safety have allowed us to operate without serious accidents since we acquired the facility.  Part of the Accident Prevention Program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  This is accomplished through Process Hazard Analyses and periodic review of policies and procedures.  Additionally, the site has various safety features to detect, contain and control, and mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\n\n1. Release detection\n\nProcess alarms\nOperator surveillance\nPortable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment \nPerimeter chlorine detection system\n\n2. Release containment and control\n\nRelief systems designed to prevent equipment overpressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare)\nDikes to contain liquid releases\nRedundant equipment (i.e. back-up firewater pump)\nAutomatic control valves to allow rapid isolation of the process\nChlorine emergency containment system\n\n3. Release Mitigation\n\nArea firewater monitors\nMobile emergency response equipment\nTrained emergency response personnel\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\tNo incidents meeting the definition of 40 CFR 68.42(a) caused by a covered RMP process has occurred at Momentive within the last five years.\n      \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Momentive Norco facility is coordinated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emerge"

These procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including first aid and medical treatment, evacuation, personnel accountability plans, notification requirements to St. Charles Parish DEP and the public in the event of a release, post-incident cleanup and area decontamination requirements. In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to Resins processes.  The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change.  All the above actions of the emergency response program are undertaken by Momentive through a service agreement with Shell. \n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\n\n1. The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n2. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\n\n3. The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\n\n4. Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\n\n5. An"
