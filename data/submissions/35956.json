      "SummaryText": "North Star Coop's approach to chemical safety is a work in progress.  The program is a work in progress because of changing rules/regulations and outside impacts on our business.  Our cooperative is always looking for ways to improve security and safety both for our facilities and our employees.  One of the major outside impacts in our business is the incresaed meth traffic in our small rural area.  We now keep all nurse tanks empty during the off season months and do not fill them until called for in the spring.\nOur Ammonia (anhydrous) facility is seperate from the rest of our operations and is a retail fill operation. The facility has one bullet on our Cavalier site.  North Star Coop trains employees to safely work with hazardous substances.  Each employee is also given instruction as to the procedures to follow should a release occur.  Our county Emergency Management and local fire department personnel are aware of our Ammonia (anhydrous) facilities.  \nNorth Star Coop has not had any accidental releases in the past five years.\nShould an accidental release occur, North Star Coop employees are to notify the following offices by dialing 911:  county Emergency Management, local fire department and police department.  The supervisor contacts the general manger.\nNorth Star Coop is a young company in the process of updating our compliance programs.  We are training our employees to follow rules and regulations put forth by the many governing agencies like the EPA to name one.  We are striving to teach our employees that safety in not something that is taught one day and forgotten about the next, but that all training no matter the topic covered is to ensure their safety on the job.  By following rules and regulations they can make a difference even if it is just by buckling their seatbelt while operating a lift truck.  Once the employees are given the tools they need to safely work in their environment, they then start to police each other and create a safer working env"
