This group monitors the on site implementation of the Process Safety Management programs through periodic meetings at each regulated facility.  In addition, the corporate safety group in conjunction with the local Depot Manager are responsible for maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  This policy is administered through Costco Wholesale's safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout / tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an emergency action plan in effect.  The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document which is maintained at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n - To save lives.\n\n - To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n - To protect the environment.\n\n - To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.\n\n\n\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated the emergency response efforts with the local fire department and with the contracted refrigeration operation and maintenance firm.  In the case of an ammonia related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate and to allow the fire department/HazMat Team to respond to the emergency.

      "SummaryText": "system was built in 2001.  The facility serves as a distribution point for chilled goods that are shipped to Costco Wholesale retail outlets.  Costco Wholesale is located at 3800 North Division Street, in Morris, Illinois.  The facility is approximately 0.06 miles (318 feet) miles west of State Route 47 and 0.36 miles north of Highway 80.  Morris is located approximately 55 miles southwest of Chicago.  The immediate area is primarily rural with some developed land (the town of Morris) south of Interstate 80.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system can safely handle a maximum intended inventory of 37,000 pounds of ammonia for cross dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  Refrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously.  Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for cold storage areas.  The majority of the system equipment is located in the ammonia engine room.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, the water diffusion tank is located outside the engine room, and the evaporators are placed in their respective cold storage areas.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from the high pressure receiver to the high temperature , medium temperature , and low temperature pump accumulators.  The high pressure receiver also supplies liquid ammonia to the compressors for oil cooling.  As the ammonia enters the high temperature recirculator , it is expanded through a hand expansion valve, reducing the pressure (and hence the temperature) in order to maintain a predetermined internal pressure.  The high temperature recirculator feeds a similar vessel that maintains an intermediate pressure, the medium temperature recirculator.  T"

      "SummaryText": "he pressure is further reduced between the medium temperature recirculator and the low temperature recirculator.  Each recirculator vessel supplies pumped liquid ammonia to a distinct set of evaporators.  Fans in each evaporator are used to blow air across and through the coils, which partially vaporizes the liquid ammonia as heat from the room is transferred to the ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe resulting two-phased (liquid/vapor) ammonia from each set of evaporators is returned to each recirculator respectively in which constant pressures (temperatures) are maintained based on the suction pressure of the corresponding compressors.  The vapor from the recirculators is then drawn to nine (9) compressors where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  All the compressors work in combination to compress the vapor pulled from the three recirculator vessels.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is routed to two (2) condensers where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and drained back to the high pressure receiver.  Hot gas is also used for defrost of the evaporators.  An auto purger periodically purges the system of non-condensables collected in the condensers.  Dual pressure relief valve assemblies are installed on each vessel to relieve high pressure ammonia to a water diffusion tank through a common header in case of a high pressure event.\n\n\n\n\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Costco Wholesale facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  Refrigeration contractors, experts in the ammonia refrigeration industry, are contracted at the facility to maintain the system and perform any repairs.\n\n\n\nAmmonia sensors are strategically located in the engine room and refr"

The sensors are in three different areas of the facility, the engine room, cold storage warehouse, and the pressure relief vent line.\n\n\n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves to the Water Diffusion Tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in the cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems that prevent equipment damage and ammonia releases.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia inventory is maintained inside the machine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).  All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent through a common header to a water diffusion tank.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, Costco Wholesale has developed a preventive maintenance program that utilizes the services of a professional refrigeration contractor to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.  This program is implemented throughout the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's accident history revealed that there have been no releases of ammonia that meet the EPA RMP Accident History Criteria in the last five years (July 2016 - July 2021). \n\n\n\n\n\nEMER"

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP document, which is maintained at the facility.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the local Morris Fire Department.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 911 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the county Hazardous Materials Response Team.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center will be called.\n\n \n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility has an Emergency Command System in place.  The Depot Manager will assume command in an emergency situation with backup personnel appointed to serve if he/she is not available.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility holds evacuation drills at least once per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Costco Wholesale facility conducted a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidation (March 2021). In addition, they complete PSM/RMP Three-Compliance Audits every three years.  \n\n\n\nThe PSM/RMP Three-Year Compliance Audits and the PHA studies generate recommendations to improve safety at the facility.  Costco maintains a list of these recommendations and is working to complete them in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nThe corporate safety group has also implemented an annual program to review the PSM and RMP programs at each of the facilities to ensure on going compliance with the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.\n\n"
