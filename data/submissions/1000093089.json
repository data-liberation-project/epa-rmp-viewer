The RMP regulation applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process per 40 CFR 68.115.\n\nThe USEPA has established three (3) tiers of requirements to reduce the level of effort for facilities with a lower risk of offsite impacts. These tiers are known as Programs 1, 2 and 3. Program 1 is\n\ndefined by a process that has had no accidental release causing offsite impacts in the past five (5)years or the nearest public receptor is beyond the distance to a toxic or flammable endpoint based\n\non the worst-case release scenario. Program 3 applies to a process that is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) or is not classified in\n\nany of the Program 3 NAICS codes defined in 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1). Program 2 applies to processes not defined by Program 1 or 3. Therefore, the Wright Smith Jr. Wastewater Treatment Facility\n\nprocesses are subject to Program 2 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe Mobile Area Water and Sewer System (MAWSS) operates the Wright Smith Jr. facility located at 1879 Conception Street Road in Mobile, Alabama. Chlorine is used as a disinfectant for treated\n\nwastewater, with the facility storing up to six (6) one-ton cylinders containing chlorine. In addition to chlorine cylinders, there are four (4) one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide, used to remove free\n\nchlorine residuals from the treated wastewater discharge, stored on-site. As stated above, Chlorine is used as a disinfectant in the treatment of wastewater and sulfur dioxide is used for the\n\ndechlorination of the wastewater effluent after chlorination and before discharge. The Wright Smith Jr. facility utilizes more than the threshol"

The initial RMP was submitted by June 21, 1999. A five (5) year update was made by\n\nMalcolm Pirnie in January 2005 updating the offsite consequence analyses determining whether the parameters and assumptions used are still valid. To comply with the five (5) year update\n\nrequirement in 2010, Goodwyn Mills Cawood (GMC) reviewed the offsite consequence analyses to determine whether the parameters assumptions used are still valid and to make any necessary\n\nchanges to update the RMP. In 2016 and 2021, GMC and the Operations staff the Wright Smith Facility reviewed and updated the plan.\n\n\n\n68.155(a) Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Wright Smith Jr. facility has established procedures to ensure the integrity of the chlorination and dechlorination systems, and minimize the potential for releases. Standard protocols have been\n\nestablished for items such as systems operations, maintenance, training, and incident investigation. To ensure the safety of the Wright Smith Jr. facility chlorination, the facility relies on the\n\ncommitment and team effort of its employees and suppliers. The Wright Smith Jr. facility has a minimum of one (1) and a maximum of fifteen (15) employees on duty at any given time, which are trained on safe operation of the chlorination and dechlorination systems. Daily inspections of the areas storing and/or using chlorine and sulfur dioxide are conducted by the facility employees. The area that stores the containers is fully enclosed and is equipped with a caustic scrubber for control of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide release. The caustic scrubber system is equipped with detectors that will automatically activate the scrubber system if a chlorine or sulfur dioxide concentration of three (3) parts per million or greater is present. In addition, MAWSS has installed emergency chl"

The system also contains an emergency \"panic button\" located\n\noutside of the storage area to allow for operator-initiated emergency shut-off. The emergency actuators require operations personnel to manually reset the emergency shut-off system. All potential releases from the Wright Smith Jr. facility will be responded to by the Mobile County Emergency Management Agency (MCEMA), whose members are aware of the presence of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the facility. The MCEMA would dispatch experienced HAZMAT personnel trained to respond to such emergencies.\n\n\n\n68.155(b) Stationary Source and Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Wright Smith Jr. facility stores and handles chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and is a stationary source potentially subject to 40 CFR 68. The facility has two (2) one-ton chlorine cylinders and two\n\n(2) one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinders connected to the proportional feed system at all times. A header pipe supplies chlorine to locations, including the biological filter units and at the influent\n\nand effluent of the clarifiers. Similarly, a header pipe supplies sulfur dioxide in one location: the effluent or the chlorine contact chamber. In addition to the two (2) sulfur dioxide cylinders and two\n\n(2) chlorine cylinders, up to two (2) additional sulfur dioxide cylinders and four (4) additional chlorine cylinders are stored inside the building that are either full waiting to be used or empty waiting to be\n\nshipped. Gaseous chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide is drawn by a vacuum though one of the two rotometers, which serve to feed chlorine at a specified rate to the ejector system. The gaseous chlorine and\n\nsulfur dioxide is mixed with treated water. The chlorine solution is injected into the water at the beginning of the chlorine contact chamber for disinfection of the plant effluent"

Emergency response activities have been coordinated with local responders\n\nwhich are also required for the Prevention Program 2 process. Lastly, a program and document management system is in place. The Prevention Program 2 process allows streamlined prevention\n\nprogram requirements; however, implementation of the following elements are required:\n\n? safety information,\n\n? hazard review,\n\n? operating procedures,\n\n? training,\n\n? maintenance,\n\n? compliance audits, and\n\n? incident investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, GMC, with the assistance of Wright Smith Jr. Facility management and staff, conducted a compliance audit and a hazard review of the chlorine system using the \"What-If\" analysis. The\n\nresults of the audit and hazard review identified recommended changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the\n\nchlorine system. The results of the audit and the hazard review, in addition to recommendations made, are documented and are maintained as part of the RMP records.
