It has been prepared in accordance with section 112? of the Clean Air Act Standard (40 CFR Part 68), RMP.  The intent of this legislation is to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the accidental release of acutely hazardous materials.  The preparation and implementation of this RMP by AMVAC Chemical Corporation, a handler of acutely hazardous materials, meets the intent of the RMP rule and relevant portions of the California Health and Safety Code.\n\nThe Hazard and Operability Study (HazOps) and hazard analysis conducted for AMVAC's pesticide manufacturing units found the units to contain multi-layers of safeguards against the possibility of acutely hazardous material release, and concluded that the units are well designed.\n\n1.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMission Statement: AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) is committed to the following:\n1.Providing its customers with environmentally friendly, cost-effective and high-quality products on time.\n2.Providing a safe and secure working environment for its employees.\n3.Operating in a manner which meets or exceeds existing laws and regulations and reflects the high level of concern and respect for the local community.\n4. Investing in its future through aggressive research and development of new products and markets.\n5. Providing its investors with higher than normal returns.\n\nSafety First Policy: Amvac will provide a safe and secure environment for its employees while maintaining a high level of concern and respect for the community.  Safe conditions and full environmental regulatory compliance will be maintained at all of its facilities. All unsafe conditions/actions will be immediately corrected and management n"

To achieve this, we follow a four-point plan based on Training, Auditing, Reporting and Enforcement.\n\n2.0 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handeled\n\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation manufactures agricultural chemical pesticides at its plant located at 4100 East Washington Boulevard in Commerce, California.  The facility consists of various type buildings, chemical reactors, aboveground storage tanks, truck loading/unloading stations, railcar loading/unloading stations, peripheral tanks, a warehouse and various ancillary equipment.  The plant employs typically a hundred and six full-time employees and operates on a three shift, twenty four-hour basis.\nAMVAC Chemical Corporation has a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals Manufacturers, a Primary Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code of 2879 for Agricultural Chemical Manufacturers.  It has Secondary SIC Codes of 2869 (Chemical Industrial Organics) and 5191 (Farm Supplies).  The plant is involved in the manufacture of pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials (AHMs) in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMPR) requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).  \n\n* Toxic Substances:\n1. Chlorine, CAS 7782-50-5 used in the PCNB manufacturing process.\n2. Bromine, CAS 7726-95-6 used in the Naled manufacturing process.\n3. Carbon Disulfide, CAS 75-15-0 used in the Metam Sodium/K-Pam/DTC manufacturing process.\n* Flammable Substances: \n1. Dimethylamine, CAS 124-40-3 used in the DTC manufacturing process.\n2.

Chlorine is received at AMVAC's facility as a liquid, which is vaporized and used as a gas in the PCNB process.\n\nNaled Manufacturing Process:\n\nThe AHM associated with the Naled process is Bromine.  The production of Naled is accomplished via reaction in a batch reactor with Bromine injected under controlled conditions.\n\nMetam Sodium/DTC/K-Pam Manufacturing Process:\n\nAHMs associated with this process are monomethylamine (for Metam Sodium/K-Pam manufacturing) and dimethylamine (for DTC manufacturing).  There are no by-products or off-gas produced in the reaction.\n\n3.0 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIn addition to the capabilities, design features and back up of the systems handling the regulated chemicals, AMVAC recognizes that the safe operation of the plant requires a thorough understanding of the physical and chemical properties of all materials and the implementation of safe handling practices.\n\n4.0 The Five Year Accident History\n\nNo accidents/incidents involving Acutely Hazardous Materials have occurred within the past five years.\n\n5.0 The Emergency Response Program\n\nAll units are equipped with multiple levels of protection.  The potential for spills or releases  is low.  However, in the event that a spill or release occurs, there are established written procedures for the handling of any emergency.\n\nThese include the Emergency Response Plan and the Operating Procedures Manuals.  The Emergency Response plan for the AMVAC facility (last revised 06/06/2003) includes written procedures for handling releases and spills of hazardous materials in any area and contains more specific emergency response procedures, including procedures for earthquake, bomb threat, riot, offsite emergencies, evacuation procedures, evacuation routes, fire prevention, emergency equipment, portable radio use and neighborhood information.
