The RMP established \n\nthree levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that\n\npose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance\n\nrequirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest\n\nrequirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\n            \n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n\n         \n\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n\n       Five-year accident history\n\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n\n          \n\nThis facility is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n\n          \n\n       It stores anhydrous ammonia in excess of the threshold quantity\n\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public receptor (residence)\n\n       It does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule\n\n       It is not subject to OSHA PSM (this is a retail facility).\n\n\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary\n\nsource that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process,\n\nas determined under 40 CFR 68.115.  CARGILL stores more than the threshold quantity\n\nof anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds) for commercial sale as fertilizer.   Therefore,\n\nCARGILL is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) as defined in\n\n40 CFR 68.150 by June 20, 1999.\n\n\n\nThe CARGILL AgHorizions is committed to operating in a safe and compliant manner. \n\nEmployees involved in operating the ammonia storage and transfer facility are throughly trained\n\nto identify and understand the hazards "

Release Duration - 10 min\n\n      \n\nThe alternative scenario chosen for this facility involves a release because of a\n\nsudden split in the hose during transfer.  While this scenario is still unlikely because\n\nthe transfer hoses used have multiple layers of rubber and a layer of braided stainless\n\nsteel wire underneath the outer sheath (to prevent abrasions, cuts, and splits) it is\n\nmore likely than the worst-case as required by 40 CFR 68.28(b)(i).  This scenario is also the\n\nmost likely to occur, since overfilling is prevented by a return vapor line to the tank\n\ntruck making the delivery.  The transfer hose rupture area is assumed at 0.5 square\n\ninches.  Because personnel are always present at the facility during transfer, CARGILL\n\npersonnel will respond within 10 minutes.  Release rate was calculated using \n\nthe OCAG tank release equation (Section 8.1.1).             \n\n        \n\nInput of the preceding data into DAGADIS+ revealed an alternative release scenario impact \n\nof 0.23 miles for the facility.

In addition, the facility has conducted and/or\n\nimplemented the following:\n\n          \n\n             hazards review\n\n             standard operating procedures\n\n             training program\n\n             maintenance program\n\n             compliance audits\n\n             incident investigation     \n\n       \n\nIn August of 1997, the CARGILL AgHorizions anhydrous ammonia facility reported release of\n\n400 pounds when a hose broke on a nurse tank.  No injuries were sustained in the accident.          \n\n         \n\nRecommendations for safety improvements were identified in the hazard review which was\n\ncompleted March 6, 1999.  Recommendations were identified for two categories: Standard\n\nOperating Procedures, and Training.  Safety improvements will be investigated concerning their\n\nimpacts on other systems and/or procedures prior to implementation.  Additional\n\nrecommendations may be made upon review of any accidents and/or when the hazard review is\n\nupdated every five years.  \n\n"
