These are unloaded at the dock level and brought into the warehouse. In the case of Chlorine cylinders, they are inspected for integrity and leaks and then placed into racks where they are secured by ratchet straps. The cylinders are then moved to the storege area at ground level outside of the warehouse. They are then inspected daily and loged off on a Chlorine inspection check list. Drummed products are inspected for leaks and then received in and swrink wraped on 48X48 pallets, 4 to a pallet. These drums are segregated from other products and not double stacked on top of one another. Every effort is made to ensure that our customers take only full pallets whenever possible. Both Chlorine cylinders and Hydrofluric Acid are transported while at the plant location by use of fork lifts, these fork lifts are kept on a regular maintaince schedule by the manufacture. Also the plant personnel are OSHA certified.
