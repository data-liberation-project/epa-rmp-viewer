Programs have been implemented and revised to ensure that every effort is made to prevent the release of any chemical substance. The chemicals on site are stringently monitored to this end. In case of a release, programs and processes are in place to alert the authorites as well as the proper responders in order to limit the effect of the release on the surrounding community.\n\nThe stationary source and chemicals are;\n\nApperson Chemicals, Inc.\n817 West Roosevelt Avenue.\nAlbany Ga. 31701\n\n1. Chlorine  CAS# 7782-50-5    container size 150# cylinder\n2. Hydrofluric Acid 70%  CAS# 7664-39-3  container size 500# drum.\n\nThe worst case scenario for Chlorine would be a 150# release over a period of 10 minutes. The release rate would be 8.25 p/pm(pounds per min). With urban surroundings the end point would be 0.3 miles. This would be assuming a wind speed of 3.4mph with a stability class of (F) and air temperture of 77 F.\nthe alternative scenerio for Chlorine would be a release of 30# over a period of 15 min.The release rate would be 2 p/pm(pounds per minute).With urban surroundings the end point would be < 0.1 miles, this would be assuming a wind speed of 6.7 mph.\n\nThe worst case scenerio for Hydrofluric acid 70% would be a 500# release into a building with a floor area of 24000 square feet, would be a release to the outside air at a rate of .300p/pm(pounds per minute). With urban surroundings the end point would be 0.1miles. This would be assumining an air speed of 3.4 miles per hour.\nThe alternitive scenerio for Hydrofluric Acid 70% would be a 30# release into a building with a floor area of 24000 square feet, would be a release to outside air at a rate of .211p/pm(pounds per minute).

These are unloaded at the dock level and brought into the warehouse. In the case of Chlorine cylinders, they are inspected for integrity and leaks and then placed into racks where they are secured by ratchet straps. The cylinders are then moved to the storege area at ground level outside of the warehouse. They are then inspected daily and loged off on a Chlorine inspection check list. Drummed products are inspected for leaks and then received in and swrink wraped on 48X48 pallets, 4 to a pallet. These drums are segregated from other products and not double stacked on top of one another. Every effort is made to ensure that our customers take only full pallets whenever possible. Both Chlorine cylinders and Hydrofluric Acid are transported while at the plant location by use of fork lifts, these fork lifts are kept on a regular maintaince schedule by the manufacture. Also the plant personnel are OSHA certified.
