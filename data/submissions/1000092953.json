Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is a covered facility under the rule because processes at the Marshall, MN facility contain more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance.  The ADM processes meet Program Level 3 criteria.  The actual components of the required RMP include:\n\n\n\nConduct a hazard assessment (release scenarios)\n\nDevelop and implement an accident prevention program\n\nDevelop and implement an emergency response program\n\nDevelopment and implementation of a management system organizational structure\n\nSubmittal of a RMP Plan\n\n    \n\nThe purpose of the RMP is to prevent the accidental release, and to minimize the consequences of any such release of hazardous substances.\n\n    \n\nAt ADM, we are committed to operating and maintaining our processes (especially those using hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n    \n\nA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\nA summary of results from our assessment of the potential off-site consequences from accidental chemical releases\n\nA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\nAn overview of our accident prevention program\n\nAn overview of our emergency response program\n\nAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environ"

Operations at the site include raw material receiving and storage, corn processing and co-product separation, product storage and shipping.  The primary products are corn sweeteners, cornstarch, and ethanol.  In our processes, we use a toxic chemical stored in quantities greater than the EPA RMP Threshold Quantity limit.  The EPA has identified that toxic chemicals exceeding Threshold Quantities have the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  The chemical and quantity is identified below.\n\n    \n\nToxics / Quantity / Use\n\n    \n\n1.

This information identifies the potential hazards and the potential risks they pose.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit exposure distances for each scenario.\n\n    \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\n    \n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is an evaluation of the impact of a release of a flammable substance from a complete failure (catastrophe) of the largest vessel, releasing the entire contents over a ten-minute period under the most stable weather conditions.  The probability of a release meeting these conditions is extremely small.\n\n    \n\nThe worst-case flammable substance release scenario at ADM's Marshall Facility is the rupture of a denaturant tank inside the tank farm and t"

The worst release would occur over a 10-minute period and the distance to 1 psi overpressure end-point is 0.3 miles..  The exposure distance was obtained using EPA Risk Management Program Guidance (EPA 550-B-98-010) and the associated RMPComp software program.  There is no mitigation measures included in this scenario.  Public and environmental receptors in this WCS include:  residences, schools, hospitals, public recreational areas, commercial / industrial areas and officially designated wildlife management areas.  The population was estimated and public receptors were identified using CAMEO-MARPlot from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Environmental receptors were identified using Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Landview Maps.  Additional information regarding the WCS is included in a scenario report attached as part of Section 9.0 and on a scenario map included in Attachment 1.\n\n    \n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\n    \n\nAn Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) is the evaluation of the impact of a more likely release of smaller quantities of material.  The causes and the amount in these scenarios were determined based on site-specific data.  The probability of this scenario is higher than worst-case scenarios and therefore is the primary focus for on- and off-site emergency planning.  \n\n    \n\nThe selected ARS for denaturant is described below.   Denaturant could be released at the facility if the tank was punctured.  The puncture area would be a ? inch hole half way up the tank; 7.07 gallons per minute of denaturant for 600 minutes (4,242 gallons) could be release.  The release would take place inside the clay lined diked berm.  The distance to heat radiation endpoint (5 kilowatts/square meter) is .1 miles.  Active mitigation in this scenario includes a level transmitter, daily visual inspections of the tanks piping and fittings, the liquid being released in to a clay lined diked berm and on-site "

Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect processes are all considered.  Through evaluation, the consequences of catastrophic releases can be prevented or minimized.\n\n    \n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) PSM Program addresses chemical accident prevention in a way that protects employees as well as the public, and the environment.  The purpose of the PSM Program is to prevent unwanted releases or minimize the impacts of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n    \n\nProcess safety information: Technical information about how a process operates\n\nProcess hazard analysis: Technical analysis of the plants processes in order to anticipate what might go wrong\n\nOperating procedures: Technical and administrative procedures used to operate the plant safely\n\nTraining: Provide employees with information necessary to ensure safe operation\n\nMechanical integrity: Proper care on an ongoing basis\n\nManagement of change: Analyze and understand the impact of changes in equipment, procedures "
