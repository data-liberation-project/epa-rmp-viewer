      "SummaryText": "1.0 General\n\nThis Risk Management Plan submittal, submitted to the EPA on June 21, 2004, is the result of the required five-year update mandated by the EPA Chemical Accident Prevention regulations detailed in 40 CFR Part 68. This update is the second RMP submittal, following the initial AET Risk Management Plan submittal on June 21, 1999. \n\n2.0 Source & Substance\n     \nThe Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc (AET) facility in Covington, Virginia produces polypropylene film and coats plastic films with a latex-type coating. The latex for the film coating process is also manufactured on site. Vinylidene chloride (VDC) is an essential component of the vinylidene chloride latex production process. Greater than 10,000 pounds of VDC is stored on-site and, therefore, AET is subject to regulations under 29CFR 1910.119 and 40CFR 68. Vinylidene chloride is regulated as a  flammable liquid. VDC is a colorless liquid with a mild, sweet odor resembling that of chloroform. If not handled properly, VDC poses a significant fire and explosion risk, as well as acute and chronic health concerns. Acute overexposure to VDC vapor by inhalation can cause irration of the respiratory tract, dizziness, nausea, headache, loss of coordination and equilibrium and -- if continued-- unconsciousness and death in confined or poorly ventilated areas.\n\n3.0 AET's Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe regulated chemical, Vinylidene Chloride {Ethene, 1,1-dichloro-], CAS No. 75-35-4 (VDC),has been used at the Covington facility since 1980. AET is very proud of the fact that, due to the numerous proactive safety measures, policies, and procedures in place, that there has NEVER been a reportable release of VDC in the entire history of the operation of the facility. The existing process has remained unchanged for several years, resulting in a very stable and well-understood process that has been well-defined from a safety perspective. In addition, since AET has downsized in recent years, the net result is that th"

      "SummaryText": "e number of operators employed in the VDC manufacturing process has remained stable, with both little operator turn-over and few new operators, resulting in knowledgeable operators possessing numerous years of operating experience in the process.\n\nIn addition, the over-all manufacturing rate for VDC at the Covington facility is running at a reduced capacity, relative to prior years, due primarily to changes in the marketplace. This decrease in operations inherently reduces the over-all risk for chemical releases which could impact the general population surrounding the Covington facility.\n\n4.0 AET's Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAs established by company procedure, it is AET's policy to insure that work operations and processes are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, including both EPA and OSHA regulations. More importantly, AET strives to take whatever measures are necessary or required to ensure the maximum possible reduction of hazard risk during all phases of operations. In this way, AET can meet its obligation to protect the safety and health of its employees and the environment as well as reduce the potential for property damage or loss. \n\nAET is a recognized leader in Safety within the polyproplyene film industry and has a Total OSHA-Recordable Injury Rate (TIR) that is less than 25% of the industry average. And, within the entire chemical industry, the TIR is even lower.\n\nAET has implemented both Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Procedures that demonstrates their commitment to maintaining the safety leadership within the industry. AET has developed and implemented safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations, including programs such as lockout/tagout and confined space entry. AET has also developed specific controls to limit access to the entire DCPL facility by all employees and contractors.                   \n\nAET has an in-house Emergency Brigade, co"

These individuals have received, and continue to receive, specialized training in areas such as confined space rescue, handling hazardous materials, personal protective equipment, and fire training.\n\nAlso, AET has added a full-time environmental engineer on staff to provide service and support to insure complete compliance with all required environmental rules and regulations. The environmental engineer provides service and support for the two AET-owned polyproplyene film plants in the United States, the Covington, Virginia facility and the Terre Haute, Indiana facility.\n\n5.0 AET's Emergency Response Program\n\nAET has a written Emergency Response Program that details specific steps and procedures required to cover any and all emergency situations which may occur, including such topics as initiating alarms, evacuation of personnel, notification of off-site personnel, plant power failure phones, emergency command center, staff resonsibilities, area responsibilities, fire zone definitions and maps, emergency agency phone numbers, corpoprate personnel phone numbers, regulatory agency and response phone numbers, news media phone numbers, emergency equipment lists, numerous fire procedures, safety and emergency procedures for radioactive devices, and chemical spill and release procedures. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan was reviewed and updated in February of 2004, and has been circulatd to a wide distribution. In addition, the entire document is accessible from within the AET intra-plant computer network system. For each of the defined emergencies, a specific and detailed procedure has been been developed"
