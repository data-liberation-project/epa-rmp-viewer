      "SummaryText": "The Ohio-American Water Company, Ashtabula Plant, is a water treatment plant that provides drinking water to customers in the area of Ashtabula, Ohio.  To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the Plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.\n\nThe concentrated form of chlorine is liquified and stored in shipping containers.  Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released into the air.\n\nOhio-American Water Company is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection and risk management programs to prevent hazardous material releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through emergency management agencies.\n\nOhio-American Water Company has completed an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel or container as a gas in ten minutes.  The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance.\n\nFor the offsite consequence analyses, the \"endpoint\" concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The endpoint (ERPG-2) established for c"

EPA RMP*COMP offsite consequence analysis software was used to estimate distances for offsite impacts.\n\nA major release of the magnitude represented by this worst-case scenario is extremely unlikely because of the robust design of chlorine transport containers (They are designed to withstand transportation mishaps.)  and the rigorous maintenance and prevention programs in place at Chlorine Suppliers and the Ashtabula Plant.  In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency palnning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s) section below.\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario was selected as the alternative release scenario.  This scenario assumes that the unloading yoke/flexible feeder  to 1-ton transport container is completely severed when perfoming  installation and testing of a full container and the resulting vapor release occurs within the building.  The mitigating affects of the building were not considered.  This means that the chemical release rate used for modeling is higher than that which would be predicted by the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is unlikely to occur but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning.\n\nThe potential distance to the endpoint concentration for this alternate release scenario extends offsite into residential and commercial areas.\n\nAs with the worst-case scenario, actual distances and directions vary with terrain and weather condition"

The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nOur prevention measures include the use of:\n\n-chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems; \n-process safety information to document the safe process design;\n-process hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n-operating procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\n-maintenance, inspection and testing ensure that the system is mainained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations;\n-training, hot work permits, contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\n-management of change and pre-startup safety reviews to ensure that changes are documented, analyzed and kept within the design basis;\n-incident investigation procedure to investigate each incident and \"near misses\" to determine root causes and make needed safety improvements;\n-and periodic compliance audits to ensure that our programs are working as they should to protect both employees and the public.\n\nWithin the past 10 years, the Ashtabula Plant has not had any accidental releases that resulted in injuries or property damage.  The plant has maintained an excellent safety record throughout its operating history and has never had a major chlorine release.\n\nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Ashtabula Plant has an emergency response program that co-ordinates emergency response with the regional emergency management agency "
