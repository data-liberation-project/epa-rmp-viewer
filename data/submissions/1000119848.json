Five Year Accident History\r\nThe District has utilized chlorine and sulfur dioxide since the Wastewater Management Facility was constructed in 1983. In over 36 years of handling these chemicals, the District has never experienced an accidental release. The District remains committed to maintaining this excellent accident history, and never experiencing an accidental release in the future. In recognition of this commitment, the District continues regular training of field personnel in the safe handling, and proper emergency response in the event of an accidental release. Safety meetings are conducted on a regular basis, and topics discussed and staff members attending are documented in District files.\r\n\r\nF. Emergency Response Program\r\nThe MCSD Wastewater Management Facility Emergency Response Program (ERP) includes the chemical-specific emergency response procedures for releases of chlorine, sulfur dioxide; and other extremely hazardous substances. The program identifies responsibilities of District personnel; coordination with outside agencies and emergency responders; hazardous material locations; engineering controls (e.g. alarms); the required personal protective equipment (PPE); and required emergency equipment.\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan is a section of the Emergency Response Program that outlines specific procedures for reducing the risk/impact of a release and emergency response procedures in the event of a hazardous gas, liquid, or solid release/spill at the WWMF. This document has been developed in cooperation with and has been integrated into the District's safety/emergency response documents.\r\n\r\nG. Planned Changes t"

Introduction\r\nThe McKinleyville Community Services District (MCSD, the District) utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide to provide disinfection of treated wastewater at their Wastewater Management Facility (WWMF) located at 675 Hiller Road McKinleyville, CA. This facility stores and utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide in excess of the listed regulatory threshold and is therefore subject to the CCR Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 - California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program as administered by the California of Emergency Services\r\n\r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\r\nMCSD is committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding community. The District recognizes the potential impact of handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide in conjunction with their wastewater treatment processes and has implemented several safety programs, procedures, and policies to prevent accidental releases. Safety programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility while policies and procedures outline detailed steps for operation and responses to specific release scenarios. In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur. In the event of an emergency, coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\r\nVarious programs including the District's Hazardous Material Business Plan, the Process Safety Management Plan, and the District's Emergency Operations Plan are regularly reviewed and updated. District staff participates in CL2 and SO2 chemical training through California Water Environment Association CWEA in cooperation with the Arcata Fire Department. The District has contracted with the Northern California Safety Consortium to conduct training sessions and functional exercises in the implementation of these various plans.\r\n\r\nC.

      "SummaryText": "o Improve Safety\r\nThe District retained the engineering consulting firm of Oscar Larson and Associates to prepare a Disinfection Alternatives Study. The purpose of the Oscar Larson and Associates study was to examine the existing practices and procedures as well as alternate disinfection methodologies to evaluate revisions to the District's current practices and procedures that might reduce the risk of accidental release and/or potential off-site consequences in the event of an accidental release. Four alternatives, in addition to the existing conditions, were identified and evaluated in the final report. Cost estimates were prepared for both capital costs and maintenance costs of each alternative.\r\nThe final report prepared by Oscar Larson and Associates recommended the District continue the current practices utilizing liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide or adopt\r\nadministrative controls to limit the inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to avoid requirements for filing the Federal RMP. District staff feels the administrative controls to limit the inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide below the federal regulatory threshold limits to avoid the requirement to file the Federal RMP, offers little or no real potential to reduce the risk or potential off-site consequences of an accidental release.\r\nThe final report also recommended installation of a number of safety upgrades to further improve the safety of the existing facilities, and/or improve the District's ability to respond in the event of an accidental release. The District has approved and implemented all recommended improvements.\r\nImprovements implemented include:\r\n\u00bf Emergency Exhaust Fan Ducts\r\n\u00bf Additional Leak Detectors\r\n\u00bf Emergency Shut-Offs\r\n\u00bf Anchors to Chain Chemical Cylinders Down\r\n\u00bf Piping Revisions\r\n\u00bf Alarm System Modifications\r\n\u00bf Electronic Ton Container Scales\r\n\u00bf Wind Monitor and Telemetry\r\nThese improvements were implemented to further improve the safety and reduce the potential consequences of"
