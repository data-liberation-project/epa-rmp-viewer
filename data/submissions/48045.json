      "SummaryText": "Alabama Power Company's Plant Gorgas, located near Parrish, Alabama is a 5 unit steam electric generating plant.\n\nIt is the policy of Plant Gorgas to provide and maintain safe and healthful working conditions and to implement and adhere to operating practices that will safeguard all employees resulting in safe working conditions, and an efficient and environmentally safe operation.   The plant has a safety program designed to ensure that the employees' working environment is safe.  This program includes training and instruction.\n\nThe process at the coal fired steam electric generating facility subject to the RMP regulations is the ammonia storage and dilution system.  This system is part of the Selective Catalytic Reductions system used to control emissions of nitrogen oxides generated from burning coal to produce electricity.\n\nBased on EPA criteria, the worst case scenario is the catastrophic failure of one of the 46,000 gallon ammonia storage tanks.  This would result in the ammonia gas traveling 1.899 miles (3.057 Kilometers) before it reached the endpoint.  However, this type of failure is extremely unlikely due to the safeguards described in the prevention program.\n\nThe worst of several alternative release scenarios considered for the release of ammonia was due to a fault in the pressure relief valve.  A failure of this type would result in ammonia gas traveling 0.124 miles (0.2 kilometers) before it reached its endpoint.  There are numerous mechanical and procedural safeguards at the Plant to prevent this from occurring.  However, for emergency response planning purposes they were not considered in the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program at Plant Gorgas is focused on the safe management of ammonia used in the ammonia storage an dilution system.  The first step in the prevention program was the establishment of a management system to assign overall responsibility and responsibility of the individual program elements.  Additi"

      "SummaryText": "onal steps include: ensuring process safety information on the ammonia storage and dilution is accurate, complete, up to date and accessible, ensuring the system is designed and modified safely by periodically conducting process hazard analyses; ensuring the system is operated and maintained in a safe manner by developing, maintaining and implementing Standard Operating and Preventive Maintenance procedures; ensuring contractors are qualified, and oriented to the site hazards; and ensuring periodic Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations are conducted including resolution of recommendations made during these investigations/reviews.\n\nNo chemical spills have occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nPlant Gorgas is included in the Walker County LEPC emergency response plan.  In addition, the Plant has in place an emergency action plan that includes procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release of ammonia.  The procedures cover the following: evacuation plan; recognizing emergencies: emergency action procedures; coordinating personnel; first aid procedures; notifying the public and local emergency response agencies; emergency response contacts; emergency response equipment; reportable release quantities and documenting releases; emergency alarm system; training; and pre-emergency coordination with the Walker County LEPC."
