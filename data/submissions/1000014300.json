These guidelines detail the requirements that must be taken by each facility to develop its safety program. The guidelines describe senior management's commitment to safety. The safety guidelines assigns the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for conducting an effective safety program.\nThere are written Corporate CHEMICAL HAZARD COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES. These guidelines describe how each facility is to develop its own local Hazard Communication program. The guidelines assign the responsibility and authority to the management team at each facility for developing an effective Hazard Communication program.\n\nPanama City Mill Policy\nIt is the policy of Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Panama City, Florida to conduct its business to insure the likelihood of a release of chlorine or chlorine dioxide is minimized and if there is a release the offsite consequence will be reduced. To accomplish this the chlorine valves, regulators, heaters, vaporizers, controllers, lines, connections, fittings, injectors and the chlorine dioxide generator, storage tanks, pipe lines, mixers and pumps are maintained according to good engineering and maintenance practices.  Our operating and maintenance employees utilizing the chlorine and the chlorine dioxide systems have been trained in the requirements of chlorine and chlorine dioxide safety.\n\nIt is also the policy of Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation to promote employee participation in all programs, including the RMP.  This is in addition to the hourly participation in the compliance audits and PSM program.\n\nDescription of Panama City operation\nSmurfit-Stone Container Corporation's Panama City facility produces kraft linerboard and bleached hardwood Market Pulp.

      "SummaryText": "prevent a slime buildup in the production process.  \n\nDescription of RMP processes\nChlorine - Water treatment\nThere are two locations on the mill site where chlorine is used to treat process water. The two systems are identical other than location. Chlorine is used from one ton cylinders. There are two cylinders connected at each location. Chlorine vapors pass through an in line electric heater, a regulator and vacuum shutoff valve, a flow meter, a flow control valve, a water driven vacuum inductor and is injected into the process water line.  \nChlorine Dioxide\nChlorine dioxide is generated on site in a process using sodium chlorate and methanol in a strong sulfuric acid solution. Chlorine dioxide is removed, as generated, by vacuum and absorbed in cold water (38-40 \u00c2\u00baF) to a concentration of 9 to 10 grams / liter. There is a 244,000-gallon storage tanks for the chlorine dioxide solution. This solution is used at several locations in the bleach plant operations. The normal usage rate is approximately 550 gpm with a maximum capacity of the system at approximately 700 gpm.\n\nWorst-case release scenario\nChlorine Dioxide\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine dioxide that will be in the largest container on site at any one time will be 231,180 gallons of solution containing 19,248 pounds of chlorine dioxide. The tank is located in an area that serves to contain any non-EPA worst-case releases expected. This contained area has a maximum exposed surface area of 24,300 square feet. This will result in a worst-case release scenario quantity of 1069 pounds per minute of chlorine dioxide. For this worst-case calculation the total time of the release for all of the ClO2 to the atmosphere has been estimated to be about 18 minutes. There are administrative controls on chlorine dioxide inventory at the facility. The chlorine dioxide tank is 62 feet tall. There are operating instructions that restrict the operating level to only 58 feet. This allows room for holding the surge volume req"

This level is recorded on the log sheet and will serve as the record that this level is not exceeded. \n\nThere are passive control measures in place at the facility.\nThe first passive control is a curbed pad area where the ClO2 storage tank is located.  The volume of this contained area is 75,000 gallons. The surface area of this curbed area is 24,300 square feet. This will not contain an EPA defined worst-case release; however, it will contain the volume of any expected release scenarios.\n  \nThe second passive control is the drain from the contained area. This drain rated at 10,000 gpm will carry the released chlorine dioxide solution into a pond (emergency clarifier) to be mixed with other process sewer water. This could result in as much as 800 of the 1069 pounds per minute release reacting and not being released to the atmosphere. However, for the selected worst-case release rate it was assumed that all the ClO2 in solution going into the pond would be released.\n\nChlorine - Water treatment\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine that will be in the largest container at each water treatment process area will be 2,000 pounds. There will be two one ton cylinders connected and operating at each process. There is no known scenario that a failure of one cylinder will cause a failure in the other cylinders at the process. Under the restrictions of the worst-case scenario a one ton cylinder will fail and will release its entire content. The worst-case release scenario quantity will be 2,000 pounds at a release rate of 200 pounds per minute. \nThere are no administrative controls on chlorine inventory.\nThere are no passive control measures in place at the facility.\n\nAlternative release scenario\nChlorine dioxide \nThe chlorine dioxide solution pump to the bleach plant is in operation and pumping at a rate of 700 gallons per minute.

It was estimated that it would require no more than 10 minutes to locate the problem and to stop and valve out the pump. This release will involve a total of 7000 gallons or 584 pounds for a release rate of 54.8 pounds per minute. The distance to the endpoint will be 2.6 miles.\nThe release rate assumption for these alternative release scenarios is that 100% of the Chlorine Dioxide in the released solution is released to the air as soon as it reaches the ground. \nChlorine - water treatment \nA tank is in service with the regulator in place. The regulator is hit causing the regulator to break off. This will result in a leak equal to the maximum withdrawal rate from the cylinder. The release rate will be 0.39 pounds per minute and the duration of the leak could be 3 to 4 hours until the next round by the operator. The distance to the endpoint is 125 yards.     \n\nFive-year accidental release history\nThere have been no RMP releases of chlorine or chorine dioxide within the five years of 2005 to date. \nThere also have been no RMP releases of chlorine dioxide since the October 15, 2000 startup of the new process.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nChlorine Dioxide\nSmurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Panama City has an OSHA Process Safety Management program in place covering its chlorine dioxide operations.

There have been no recommendations for inclusion in the documentation.\n\nPlanned Improvements to Improve safety.\nThe Panama City mill is constantly improving upon its safety program. A strict monthly Safety and Housekeeping Calendar ensures all safety systems are maintained in the highest level of effectiveness and preparedness. As process and systems change, so does our methodology for protecting our employees. Our mill holds the safety of our employees on the same level as producing a quality product - number one. We are the trendsetters in both of these areas, not the followers. As a residual effect, our neighbors in the community and the surrounding area benefit. The less problems within the mill means less likelihood of problems for our neighbors. As we move into the next millennium, we will continue to look at our methods and to ask ourselves if we can achieve the same results in a safer and more efficient manner.\n\nThe following changes to the 112(r) Risk Management covered process have been made.\nThe Panama City mill on October 15, 2000 completed a major modification of its pulp bleaching process. During this modification of the process the following changes were made that affect the 112(r) Risk Management Program.\n\u00c3\u00bf The use of elemental chlorine, as a bleaching agent, was stopped. This change in the bleaching process has removed the 180,000-pound railcars from the mill.\n\u00c3\u00bf A new state-of-the-art chlorine dioxide generator was installed to replace the 25-year-old unit. This new chlorine dioxide generator is more efficient, safer, and has all the up-to-date controls and protective equipment.\n\u00c3\u00bf This changes the EPA defined worst-case release scenario from a release of 180,000 pounds of chlorine to a release of 19,250 pounds of chlorine dioxide.\n \nOn January 2, 2006, the plan was reviewed and resubmitted.
