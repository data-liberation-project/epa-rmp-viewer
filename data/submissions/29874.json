It is Osnabrock Farmers Co-op Elevator's policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency should occur it is our policy to notify the Osnabrock Volunteer Fire Department and the Cavalier County Sheriffs Department to request that they respond to the emergency.\nOsnabrock Farmers Co-op Elevator is a country grain elevator making available anhydrous ammonia for sale to its patrons as a nitrogen fertilizer source.  The anhydrous ammonia plant, located directly northwest of the main elevator and dry fertilizer plant was constructed new in the summer of 1998.  The anhydrous ammonia plant consists of one 30,000 gallon storage tank, twenty 1,450 gallon nurse tanks and five 1,000 gallon nurse tanks, a three inch liquid pump, associated piping, safety valves, excess flow devices and two fill stands capable of filling two nurse tanks each are also on site.  The storage tank and nurse tanks are never filled to more than 85% of their capacity as required for safe product handling.\nOur worst case scenario would involve a massive failure in our 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the maximum amount allowed (85% of 30,000 gallons) resulting in the release of the entire contents of the storage tank.  An occurance such as this is deemed highly unlikely considering the following.\n1)  The construction and age of storage tank. (Built in 1997)\n2)  The function of all safety valves and excess flow devices which shutdown within seconds following the detection of free flowing product.\n3)  The transfer of anhydrous ammonia is never left unattended allowing for manual shutdown procedures.\n4)  Periodic inspection by the North Dakota Boiler Inspector for the North Dakota Department of Insurance.\nSince the anhydrous ammonia plant construction we have not had an accident involving the accidental release of anhydrous am"
