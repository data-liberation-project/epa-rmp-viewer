The Facility Policy\n     The owners, owner's employees, and management of Lone Pine Ag-Services, Inc are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, Local Emergency Preparedness Team, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information\n     The primary activity at the anhydrous ammonia facility is the storage and filling of anhydrous ammonia tanks. \n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  \n     The State Environmental Agency does a yearly  inspection of our anhydrous ammonia facility.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 84,150 lbs in our one 18,000 gal storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a truck tanker holding 48,000 lbs and the possibility of 18 nurse tanks on-site with a maximum capacity of 84,150 lbs.\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n     The facility has implememnted the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1 published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc, and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n4.
