FACILITY POLICY.\n\n        The owners, management and employees of Sunflower Chemical, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local rural fire department, Sheridan County LEPC and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the realease to the people and the environment.\n\n2.     FACILITY INFORMATION.\n\n        The primary activity at the facillity is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application AS A NUTRIENT for crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 106,000 pounds in the storage tank and the nurse tanks.\n\n3.     WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n        a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the LARGEST storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n        \n        B.     The altemate release scenario, a 2\"-transfer hose is used as an altermate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 11,908 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 miles.  The most likely potential incident, would release from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose  scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before the automatic excess flow shut-down valve interv"

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles.\n\n4.     ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n        The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form,  see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.     FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n        There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.     EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\n        The facility has:\n\n        a.    A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standart 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n        b.    Provided state and loacal authorities with emergency planning and community right-to know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n        c.    If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at the facility, the required response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers.\n\n              1. Within 15 minutes of determining  the amount of release would be over 100 pounds, the Emergency Coodinator will notify:  The National Emergency Response center @ 800/424-8802.\n\n              2.  Within 24 hours of determining the amount of release would effect the environment, the Emergency Coordinator will notify:  The Kansas Bureau of Environmental Remediation @ 785/296-1679 or after normal business hours at 785/296-0614 and the Kansas Department of Emergency Management @ 785/296-3176.\n\n7.
