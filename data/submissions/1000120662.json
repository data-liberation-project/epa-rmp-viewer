The facility has one regulated processes onsite that uses liquefied natural gas (LNG): LCNG Fueling Station. The RMP's developed for each of these processes address United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) RMP requirements. Finally, because this facility is subject to the Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standards, the RMP's are designed to meet the specific requirements of those standards as well.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc.'s policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. is committed to protect the health and safety of its employees and the public. In order to achieve this objective, Waste Management has allocated and invested considerable resources in implementing reasonable controls to prevent predictable releases of LCNG by training its employees, by the safe design, installation, maintenance and operation of this facility, and by installing fire and leak detection and mitigation systems.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nWaste Management Of Alameda County, Inc.'s Altamont Landfill and Resource Recovery Facility is located at 10840 Altamont Pass Road in unincorporated Alameda County near Livermore, California.  The facility is approximately 2.1 miles north of Interstate 580 and 16 miles east of Interstate 680. The area immediately surrounding the facility is mostly undeveloped with the closest industrial buildings located approximately 2 miles away.\n\nThe facility has one regulated process onsite that  uses LNG: the LCNG Fueling Station. Methane, which is the major component of LNG, is considered hazardous by the USEPA. LNG is a flammable gas. It is stored at -25"

The process employed in the fueling station involves converting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to compressed natural gas (CNG), which in turn will be used as a fuel to power solid waste transfer trucks operated by Waste Management. Typical operating conditions range from 60-110 psig on the low pressure LNG system to 4,200 psig on the CNG side.  Construction of the fueling system began in 2011, with operations beginning in March 2012.  The system's maximum intended inventory of 50,750 pounds. \n\nThe Altamont LNG Facility and Flare System have been deregistered. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. to prevent the accidental release of LCNG at the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the systems are operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the systems are in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before LNG is introduced into a new or modified process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of LNG and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIn addition, to ensure worker and community safety, the facility includes numerous mechanisms for preventing accidents.

In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \u0093near misses\u0094 that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWaste Management of Alameda County, Inc. has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.

The mitigation measures include additional training, key maintenance related tests/inspection, and enhanced emergency response policies and procedures. WMAC is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility's safety plans/programs.\n\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in the development of the facility's safety plans/programs.\n\n3. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
