Operations at the facility include the processing of frozen baked and unbaked pies and desert cups for public consumption.  Sara Lee Frozen Bakery - Traverse City, MI has been in operation for over 50 years providing quality products and approximately 500 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC - Traverse City, MI is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore, it is our policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment, and maintain compliance with federal, state and local environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, including 40 CFR 68, Subpart G (Risk Management Plan), 29 CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals), and 29 CFR 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response).\n\n\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nSara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC - Traverse City, MI is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required to ensure quality in the final products.  Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC - Traverse City, MI uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112(r) regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant, used in systems consisting of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, and piping in an engineered closed loop system.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-"

To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC - Traverse City, MI has implemented several precautionary measures, such as process/equipment controls, standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance programs, employee training and audit programs.  \n\nThe facility maintains a \"no odor\" policy.  The \"no odor\" policy instructs employees that detect an ammonia odor to call the Refrigeration Maintenance staff and the staff must respond immediately to the call to address the situation.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we implement and comply with OSHA's PSM regulations and as such, have evaluated and engineered for anhydrous ammonia releases.   Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shutoffs, ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding).  In addition, Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC - Traverse City, MI has trained approximately 25 personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (HazMat response team).\n\nThe facility has developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed on an annual basis by means of a SOP review session.  Process safety information for the refrigeration system is reviewed during these annual meetings as well.  The organization encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of the annual procedures review.  Any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees following written management of change procedures established by the facil"

System maintenance activities are scheduled, documented and managed to ensure that the refrigeration system is properly maintained.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical refrigeration system components, auditing is conducted every 5 years by a certified refrigeration contractor.  To ensure that our measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the PSM program, Sara Lee Frozen Bakery - Traverse City, MI conducts detailed PSM compliance audits every three years that incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.  Furthermore, our facility is subject to auditing by the local fire department, OSHA, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOver the last five years, Sara Lee Frozen Bakery - Traverse City, MI not experienced an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia causing any on-site death, injury or significant property damage, or known off-site death, injury, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSara Lee Frozen Bakery - Traverse City, MI has developed a comprehensive emergency response program designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release.

These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120; these employees receive initial training and annual update training thereafter. Sara Lee Frozen Bakery - Traverse City, MI stages mock release incidents at least annually to test the skills of the HazMat team, determine the team's readiness, and identify areas of improvement.\n\n\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with our emergency response procedures, we submitted copies of our ERP for review and approval by the local agencies.  The following local agencies have participated Mock release events to gain knowledge and understanding of the Sara Lee Frozen Bakery - Traverse City, MI ERP:\n\n\n\nGrand Traverse Metro Fire Department\n\nTo pre-plan for an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the facility ERP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, evacuation procedures, and procedures for public communication.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) according to the facility's off-site plan which is updated on an annual basis by the LEPC.  Any significant changes to the ERP will be communicated to the agencies listed above.\n\n\n\nContinuous Efforts to Improve Safety\n\nNo changes to the ammonia refrigeration process are planned at this time.
