(GPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation, owns and operates a synthetic resin manufacturing facility in Louisville, MS.  The facility is located on South Church Ave and is adjacent to Georgia Pacific Particleboard and Georgia Pacific Plywood plants.  The resin facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1967 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins.  This formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1997.  Overall, the facility employs 55 full-time employees.\n\nGPRI is committed to operating the Louisville, Mississippi plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GPRI  has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Louisville Plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency\u0012s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the Louisville Plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Louisville Plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the Louisville Plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n7 a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n \n7 a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes c"

All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures.  The plant periodically conducts emergency response drills, including annual drills coordinated with the local fire department.  The written emergency response plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (e.g., the OSHA regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a), 29 CFR 1910.120(a)) and has communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department.

The offsite consequence analysis evaluates a \u0013worst case release scenario\u0014 and an \u0013alternative release scenario\u0014.  GPRI does not expect a worst case release scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were selected to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.  An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like the Louisville Plant and (2) would result in the greatest potential offsite consequences if the release occurred.\n\nThe main objective of performing the offsite consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance).  The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance.  At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less.\n\nWhen considering the release of a toxic substance, most people at the endpoint distance would be able to walk away from the exposure without any long term health consequences, although some short term consequences (e.g., strong eye or throat irritation) are possible.  Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by GPRI.  These requirements are:\n\n7 one worst case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes\n \n7 one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process\n \none worst case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 3 processes\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by the Louisvi"
