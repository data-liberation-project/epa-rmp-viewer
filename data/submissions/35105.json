      "SummaryText": "The Sedalia anhydrous ammonia facility owned by Sabina Farmers Exchange is located at 5850 St. Rt. 323, Mt Sterling Ohio.  The facility is located 5 miles east of Sedalia, 5 miles west of Mt. Sterling, and is situated on St. Rt. 323 along I-71.  This site was choose because it is located in a rural setting, away from and residences or businesses.  It is also placed to receive benefit from the prevailing winds that blow through the area (soutwest to northeast) over large amounts of rural terrain.  This facility is used exclusively for the storing of anhydrous ammonia and for the re-filling of anhydrous ammonia wagons to be delivered to our farm customers.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facility will vary from 1 - 80 tons of ammonia, depending on the time of the year.  The peak time of storage and movement of product is during the months of December thru June.  The months of July thru November are the periods when a minimum amount of anhydrous ammonia (1 -25 tons) will be kept on site.\n     The owner and managers of Sabina Farmers Exchange plan and implement safety programs throughout the company.  Any new technology available to ensure a safe working environment for all employees is and will continue to be evaluated for additions on an annual basis.  The specific anhydrous ammonia safety program will be evaluated each year to meet company standards as well as state and federal mandates.\n     The facility is located in a rural setting and is routinely patroled by the Madison Co. deputy sheriff office to help prevent vandalism or theft.  The plant manager also conducts weekly inspections of the storage area for any signs of tampering as well as any maintenance issuses that need attention.  Theft or vandalism have not been a problem to date due to the location and surveilance of the area.  There is also night security lighting that comes on at dusk to light the area.

Excess flow valves designed to stop a sudden flow of product are installed in the product line so a sudden release of product would be stopped immediately .  There is also a respirator on site, and a fresh water tank that holds 150 gallons of water is located nearby.  Fresh water is the ideal treatment for anyone coming into contact with anhydrous ammonia.  Company employees also have cell phones and two-way radios in case of emergency.  Eye goggles and rubber gloves are also provided to all employees and customers at the location.  All safety equipment and anhydrous ammonia equipment will be safety checked annually by the fertilizer manager at the Sedalia facility.  A separate annual inspection will be conducted by the Ohio Department of Agriculture as well.  All employess of Sabina Farmers Exchange that work with and around anhydrous ammonia will attend an anhydrous ammonia training school as well as a company sponsored training seminar.  All new hires that will work with anhydrous ammonia in need of training will attend these sessions as well.\n     We plan to co-ordinate training with the local fire dept. and the emergency response service.  We will give a complete tour of the faciliy as well.  At this time, we plan to educate the group on how our equipment functions, where potential dangers lie in handling the product, and give expediate procedures to reach or locate managers of Sabina Farmers Exchange.\n     We have had no anhydrous ammonia injuries to date.  There have been no problems with the surrounding communities to require any evacuations as well\n\n     Worst-case release scenaio:\n\n     This scenario is based on the release of 140,000 lbs (entire tank) of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank.

The impact to the offsite area would be dependent on the prevailing wind direction and speed.  If the prevailing wind occurred (west to east), the impact would be minimal because the surrounding area is of rural terrain.  There are 3 - 4 residences located to the east of the facility that may require evacuastion, however.  If the wind were to be from the south, southeast direction, anhydrous ammonia vapor would then travel in the direction of Interstate I-71, causing a disruption in traffic flow and would require traffic to be re-routed until the vapor cloud dissipated.\n\n     Alternative release scenario:\n\n     This scenario is based on the release of 50 lbs of anhydrous ammonia.  This could be caused by the rupture of a transfer hose or a leak at a fitting.  The impact to the area would again be dependent on the wind direction and speed.  If the prevailing wind were to occur, there would be no effect because the ammonia vapor would travel over vacant farmland and quickly dissapate.  The same would happen if the wind were to blow from the south.  Depending on the velocity of the wind, there may be an offensive odor detected on I-71, but a release of this amount would quickly dissapate however and cause no disruption in overall traffic flow.\n     Sabina Farmers Exchange has stored and handled anhydrous ammonia for over 30 years at our Sabina facility without any incident involving injury or release of product.  With a continued effort to train our employees and maintain our equipment, we plan to improve on that track record with our Sedalia facility as well."
