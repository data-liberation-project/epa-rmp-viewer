They will also strive to ensure that there will be no damage to plant, equipment, materials or any other property as the result of accidents or fires.  Health, safety and the protection of the working environment have equal status with other primary business objective.  Safe working practices and due consideration of the working environmental factors are vital to the business.  Health, safety and the protection of the working environment are the direct responsibility of management, and consequently form an integral part of the duties of all Managers and Supervisors.  All employees will take a personal responsibility for their health and safety, and for the protection of the working environment.  The Group will ensure that employees have the required skills and support to meet this commitment.  In addition, Outokumpu, Inc., promotes and welcomes the active participation of all in its employ in the establishment and observance of measures to improve their health, safety and working environment.  All contracting companies engaged by Outokumpu, Inc., and their employees, are required to work to similar, consistently high standards, and achieve comparable levels of performance.

      "SummaryText": "dered finished plate size.  Rolled finished sized range from 3/16 to 6 inches thick up to 120 inches wide and up to 420 inches long.  The cut cogg plate is then heated in natural gas fired furnaces and rolled to finish gauge.  The rolling process can require up to three heatings of the cogg plate at intermediate gauges before reaching finished gauge.  After rolling, the plates are annealed to improve the internal structure of the plate.  The plates then move to the finishing department.  The plates are shotblasted to remove the scale, oxidized steel that forms on the surface during annealing.  The plates are then flattened and cut to their final length and width.  The next process for the plates is pickling followed by final inspection and placement in the warehouse for shipment to customers.  Outokumpu Stainless, Inc., has 70% solution of Hydrofluoric Acid in 55 gallon drums.  This acid is used in the pickling operation.  Plates will come in contact with the acid to assist in removing scale oxidation from the steel surface.  The acid bath concentration is approximately 3% Hydrofluoric acid and 12% Nitric Acid.  The acid concentrations in the baths would not fall under the regulated substance under RMP.  There are two (2) pickling operations, therefore, there are two (2) containment areas where hydrofluoric acid (70%) drums are stored.  Approximately 40 in the 120? containment area and 5 in the batch pickle area.  Outokumpu Stainless, Inc., has identified a worst-case scenario of the largest vessel of the hydrofluoric aced (70%) one (1) drum rupturing (500 lbs.).  These drums are stored in a containment area and inside a building therefore, offsite impact is very minimal.  When pumping the Hydrofluoric Acid (70%) into the pickling baths a drum pump is used to transfer the material.  The alternative scenario for Outokumpu Stainless, Inc, would be for the hose to become separated from the pump and allowing Hydrofluoric Acid (70%) to be released.  If this alternative s"

Employees are trained in proper handling of Hydrofluoric Acid (70%) drums and to try and avoid spillage.  There has not been an accidental release of Hydrofluoric Acid (70%) in over ten (10) years.\n\nIf a spill should occur outside of the spill containment of storage areas or exceed the capacity of the containment structure, the emergence coordinator or alternate for Outokumpu Stainless, Inc., will initiate a response to control, contain and recover the spilled substance.  The emergency coordinator must evaluate if the facility?s employees are capable of making an effective response, and have adequate personal protection.  If the spill is too large for the facility employees to handle expeditiously or involves a substance which requires special protective equipment or special procedures, the emergency coordinator shall be prepared to contact an emergency response contractor of other services which may assist in the containment, recovery and cleanup of the spilled material.  The emergency coordinator shall also contact the appropriate environmental regulatory agencies and coordinated emergency services.\n\nSpill incidents may present hazards to public health or the environment if they occur outside of a containment area.  The emergency coordinator must take actions immediately to prevent migration of the substance of contaminated water off the property or into navigable waterways, water supplies, or aquifers.  If harmful vapors may be released from a spilled substance, the emergency coordinator shall notify the local authorities of this condition and work with them to advise or evacuate persons downwind on the site as may be necessary.
