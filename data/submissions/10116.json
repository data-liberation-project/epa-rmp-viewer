Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Windom Cooperative Association in Windom are strongly committed to employee, public,\nand environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures,\nmaintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to\nimplement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release\ndoes occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects\nof the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Windom Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have propane \nstored in two interconnected 30,000-gallon tanks located at our facility in Windom (Figure 1).  The\nmaximum amount stored is 51,000 gallons (215,373 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected propane storage tanks (215,373 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period. \nAt Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of\n1 psi overpressure is 0.48 miles (Figure 2).

The estimated\npopulation within a 0.48-mile radius of this facility is 1,200.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral\nweather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.14 mile (Figure\n3).  The estimated population within a 0.14-mile radius of this facility is 75.\n\n     4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nWindom Cooperative Association maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes\nthe chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes\n(Appendix D).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWindom Cooperative Association maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities\nwithin our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of\noperation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in\nthe processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nWindom Cooperative Association has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nWindom Cooperative Association conduc"

Maintenance checks are performed by qualified personnel with previous\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Windom Cooperative Association to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or\nother employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly\nnotified of the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nWindom Cooperative Association routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new\nprocesses and modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that\nconstruction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior\nto placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\nWindom Cooperative Association conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine\nwhether the provisions of the plan, as set out under 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any\nnon-compliance issue discovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nWindom Cooperative Association truly believes that process safety management and accident\nprevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views\nconcerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees\nhave access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP\nparticularly information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5.
