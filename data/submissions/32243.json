The Weslaco emergency response policy involves the preparation of a response plan tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. The policy adheres to EPA Prevention Program procedures where applicable, and is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nThe City of Weslaco's Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 907 North Airport Road, Weslaco, Hidalgo County, Texas. Its chlorination building consists of a three-walled, canopy structure facing north, and located approximately in the middle of the facility. Four, one-ton cylinders of chlorine are stored at the facility. Two, one-ton containers inside the walled canopy are connected to the system and the other two are for backup. The chlorine cylinders are equipped with manual shutoff valves in the event of an emergency, and an alarm activates at the occurrence of released chlorine. Personnel oversee the facility 24 hours a day, including daily inspections of the chlorine building. The facility houses emergency air and power supply. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) storage occupies locations in the office and workroom approximately 100 feet and 200 feet, respectively, from the chlorination building.\n\nThe following key elements outline the accidental relase prevention program for the Weslaco Wastewater Treatment Plant: the high level of training of  the operators; the preventive maintenance program; the use of state of the art process and safety equipment; the use of accurate and effective operating procedures--written with the participation of the operators; the performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures; and the implementation of an audit and inspection program.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at the site in the past five years.\n\nThe City of Weslaco's F"
