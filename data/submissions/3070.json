THE OWNER, MANAGEMENT, AND EMPLOYEES OF CROPMATE COMPANY/UAP HWY. 96 & HOLIDAY ST. NICKERSON, KS. ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO  WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE ON PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION:\n\nA. THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS     \n     AMMONIA FOR PRODUCTION OF NON-HAZARDOUS LIQUID FERTILIZER.\n\nB. ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND BLENDED AS A FERTILIZER  \n    NUTRIENTS FOR AGRICULTURAL CROPS.\n\nC. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY THAT CAN BE STORED IS  131,325 LB., IN ONE 30,000 GAL. \n    STORAGE TANK.  THE NORMAL METHOD OF RECEIVING AMMONIA AT THE FACILITY IS BY \n    TRUCK TRANSPORT CONTAINING 43,000 POUNDS.  \n         \n     (Note: maximum quantity allowed to be stored is 85% of storage tank size)\n\nIII. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nA. THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL                      \n    CONTENTS OF STORAGE TANK AS A GAS OVER 10 MINUTES. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY \n    RELEASED WOULD BE 131,325 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE   \n    STORAGE TANK AT 85 PERCENT CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE \n    DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) IS 1.16 MILES.\n\nB. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO, BASED ON THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY           \n    (OR THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT) IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER        \n    HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT (point of dispersion to 200 PPM) IS  0.56 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\n1. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF \"SAFETY REQUIREMENTS"

HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATH, INJURIES, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE                  \n    FACILITY, NOR\n\n2. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFF-SITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS,            \n    SHELTERING IN PLACE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE. \n\nVI. THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n1. THE FACILITY HAS:\n\nA. A WRITTEN EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD \n    29 CFR 1910.38. \n\nB. PROVIDED TO THE STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE EMERGENCY PLANNING AND            \n    COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION AS REQUIRED UNDER SARA TITLE III (EPCRA).\n    \nC. A WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA STANDARD,\n    29 CFR 1910.120, INCLUDING PRE-EMERGENCY PLANNING AND EMPLOYEE TRAINING.        \n   \nVII. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  \n\n    SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ARE AN ON-GOING PROCESS AT THE FACILITY.  PERIODIC                      \n    EVALUATIONS ARE PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE CONDITIONS.\n\nA.
