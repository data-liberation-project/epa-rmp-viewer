Aqueous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum amount of 30% aqueous ammonia stored is approximately 120,000 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 24 percent pentane and approximately 21 percent isopentane, both RMP-regulated substances.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 180,000 pounds (total pentane approximately 42,000 pounds; total isopentane approximately 37,000 pounds).  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant"
