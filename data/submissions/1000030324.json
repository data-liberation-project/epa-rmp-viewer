As a requirement of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and Clean Air Act Amendments 112; Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC completed a risk management plan (RMP) for chemicals stored on-site above RMP reporting thresholds. Regulated chemicals at Pacific Ethanol Madera, LLC include isopentane and pentane  (each exceed 10,000 pound threshold) and aqueous ammonia (exceeds 20,000 pound threshold).\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nPacific Ethanol Madera, LLC is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol production process.

Aqueous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum amount of 30% aqueous ammonia stored is approximately 120,000 pounds.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which may contain approximately 24 percent pentane and approximately 21 percent isopentane, both RMP-regulated substances.  The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is approximately 180,000 pounds (total pentane approximately 42,000 pounds; total isopentane approximately 37,000 pounds).  Unleaded fuel may also be used as a denaturant"
