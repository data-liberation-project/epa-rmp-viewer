The update submittal containes several changes from the previous submittal.  The submittal changes to Program Level I the chemicals Dimethylamine (40%) and Ethyl chloride (30%); eliminates three chemicals, Mono-Isopropylamine (97%) due to no longer being used in any process, Muriatic acid (32%) due to a reporting requirement change by the EPA dated 8/25/97, and 65% Oleum which will now be stored in less than the reportable Threshold quantity due to limited use.  The submittal also eliminated Ammonia Storage Tank T-8414, as we no longer require additional on-site storage. \n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Lobeco Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Intermediate Dye & Pigment Manufacturer.  We have 6 regulated substances above Threshold quantity present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (aqueous), Dimethylamine  [Methanamine, N-methyl-], Ethyl chloride  [Ethane, chloro-], Ethylenediamine  [1,2-Ethanediamine], Formaldehyde, and Methyl chloroformate  [Carbonochloridic acid, methylester]. Ammonia (29% solution) and Methyl chloroformate (97% solution) are used for manufacturing Herbicide.  Dimethylamine (40% solution) is used in manufacturing an intermediate chemical for sale to other manufacturers.  Ethyl chloride ("

Formaldehyde (37% solution) is used for manufacturing a water based additive. \n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde (37%) is 57,000 lbs., Methyl chloroformate (97%) is 40,000 lbs., Dimethylamine (40%) is 38,200 lbs., Ethylenediamine (99%) is 38,000 lbs., Ethyl Chloride (30%) is 65,000 lbs., and Ammonia (29%) is 81,000 lbs. \n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Pro-98 Program which has incorporated the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternate release scenario analysis, we have also used the RMP Pro-98 Program incorporating the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The most recent upgrade to the RMP Pro-98 Program , upgrade #18, was used for this submittal.  The calculated released quantity for both the worst case and alternate scenario is different from our original submittal, but the end point remains the same.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Methyl chloroformate Tank T-22.  In this scenario 40000 lb. of Methyl chlorofromate [Carbonochloric acid, methylester] (97%) is released.  The total quantity of the methyl chloroformate storage tank is released into the diked area, which is covered by a building and the spilled material is allowed to evaporate.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 5,630.7"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind-speed, the maximum distance of 0.53 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0019 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Methyl chloroformate  [Carbonochloridic acid, methylester] involves a ruptured transfer hose between the MCF Storage Tank T-22 and the delivery Tanker Truck.  The scenario involves the release of 125 lb. of  MCF.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 40.81 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0019 mg/L of Methyl chloroformate (97%)  [Carbonochloridic acid, methylester] is 0.25 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde involves a ruptured transfer hose between Formaldehyde Storage Tank T-8452 and the delivery Tanker Truck.  The scenario involves the release of 185 lb. of Formaldehyde.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L of Formaldehyde (37%) is 0.11 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from a ruptured transfer hose between Ammonia Storage Tank T-17 and the delivery Tanker Truck.  The scenario involves the release of 99 lb. of Ammonia.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Existing dike systems have been modified and some new dikes constructed around those chemicals that are affected by the RMP Program.  We have also constructed an enclosure around our Methyl chloroformate Storage Tank as an additional passive mitigation system.  We have initiated semi-annual preventive maintenance programs that verify the integrity of the associated pumps for off-loading chemicals from tank trucks.  These changes have already taken place, but Lobeco Products, Inc. is committed to continuously strive to provide safety features to prevent any accidental release of a hazardous chemical substance.\n\n8.
