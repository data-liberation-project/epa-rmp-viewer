The threshold quantity for chlorine under the RMP regulation is 2,500 pounds.  A maximum of 4,000 pounds of chlorine may be in use and storage at the Robstown WWP, and therefore the RMP regulation is applicable.\nThe Robstown WWP has accidental release prevention and emergency response policies in place.  Accidental release prevention includes employee training on the hazards of chlorine, operating and maintenance procedures on the chlorine system.  The wastewater treatment plant, including the chlorine building and chlorine process, were designed and built according to applicable industrial specifications.  The process is operated in such a way as to minimize the risk associated with the use of chlorine.  The process equipment is operated and maintained in accordance with equipment manufacturer's operation and maintenance procedures.\nIn case of emergency, Robstown WWP personnel are trained to be first responders to a fire or chemical incident, and are trained in notification procedures to activate a response from off-site emergency response organizations including the Robstown Fire Department and Police Department.  If needed, the Robstown Fire Department could also call the Refinery Fire Terminal Company (RTFC) for back up and additional capabilities in chemical emergency response.\nThe Robstown WWP has had no all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on the site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage in the last five years.\nThe Robstown WWP has an emergency response program that includes procedures for informing the public and emergency response organizations about accidental releases.  The emergency response plan has documentation of the proper first-aid procedures and emergency me"

The emergency response plan also covers procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance, and training for all employees involved in the chlorine process.  \nProcedures are in place to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the facility and ensure employees are informed of changes.  At a minimum the RMP will be audited at least every three years and updated and renewed every five years.  Any necessary changes to the emergency response program would be made on an on-going and as needed basis, or following an incident investigation, RMP audit, or RMP renewal.\nPlanned changes to improve safety include evaluating using different  containers (150 pound cylinders in lieu of one ton containers), and repair/replacement of the overhead hoist if one ton cylinders remain in use."
