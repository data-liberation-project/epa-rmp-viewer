This commitment is demonstrated by the resources it has invested in accident prevention and training, as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  RRE's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent release of regulated substances.  However, if a release occurs, RRE personnel may respond to contain and control the release.\n\n\n\nStationary Source Description and Regulated Substance\n\nThe plant is located just east of Rosholt, SD and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  Denaturant (natural gasoline) is stored in an aboveground storage tank.  Denaturant contains greater than 1% of regulated substances (butane, isopentane, and pentane) and is regulated as a Flammable Mixture.   \n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of covered materials at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program Information\n\nThe plant prevention program includes safety information (Safety Data Sheets, regulated substance inventory, and equipment and process specifications), periodic reviews, written operating procedures consistent with safety information, training (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annually), maintenance schedules and procedures, and compliance audits.     \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nRRE's Safety Compliance Manual, Emergency Action Plan, and Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control (SPCC) Plan address emergency response requirements.
