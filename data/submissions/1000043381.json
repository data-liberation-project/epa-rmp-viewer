      "SummaryText": "Introduction:\n\n\n\nEvonik Corporation, Mapleton facility, is resubmitting the fully updated Risk Management Program (RMP) as required by the Chemical Accident Prevention Regulation (40 CFR 68.190).\n\n\n\nThe Mapleton site initially consisted of an Oleochemicals portion and a Metal Alkyl portion.  The site was divided into two separate facilities under separate ownership in 1999.  The Oleochemicals portion of the Mapleton site is owned and operated as Evonik Corporation. The Metal Organic portion is owned and operated by a separate company. This RMP document covers the portion of the Mapleton Plant owned by Evonik Corporation. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nIn this document, the owner and operator of the Evonik Corporation Mapleton site will be referred to as \"Evonik.\"  Evonik is committed to providing the processes, facilities, standards, resources, training, discipline, and work culture to ensure 1) a safe environment for all employees and for the communities in which we operate; 2) safe, effective products for our customers; 3) conservation of energy and natural resources; 4) responsible waste management; and 5) protection of shareholder assets. At Evonik, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nThe Mapleton site consists of 515 acres of land, while production facilities occupy approximately 45 of these acres. Approximately 200 employees operate this 24 hour per day, 7 day a week facility, which processes natural fats and oils into intermediates for consumer products and industrial type products. Our finished products are used in hundreds of consumer products, including shampoos, conditioners, skin lotions, sun screens, fabric softeners, and household cleaners, as well as in many industrial processes as lubricants, paper debonders, textile finishes, mining flotation reagents, asphalt emulsifiers, adhesives, curing "

      "SummaryText": "agents, biocides, and blowing agents.\n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of our manufacturing processes that utilize those chemicals that fall under the EPA's RMP regulations. The Evonik Mapleton production facilities fall under the Program Level 3 processes.\n\n\n\nThe Mapleton facility uses five toxic chemicals that fall into this program:  acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, ammonia (concentration 20% or greater), formaldehyde, and methyl chloride.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and \n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nEvonik complies with OSHA's PSM rule and EPA's RMP rule. We also participate in American Chemistry Council's (ACC) Responsible Care(r) program and the facility is ISO EMS RC 14001 certified. We take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Our management system addresses each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Training\n\n- Mechanical Integrity\n\n- Management of Change\n\n- Pre-Startup Reviews\n\n- Compliance Audits\n\n- Incident Investigations\n\n- Employee Participation\n\n- Hot Work Permits\n\n- Contractor Safety\n\n\n\nEvonik has \"Layers of Protection\" to help ensure that an emergency situation with off-site implications will not arise and have put several layers of safety and environmental protection into place. This includes the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Employees are well trained and are our most important resource in operating our facility and in protecting our community.\n\n- Mechanical Integrity testing for major pieces of process equipment like metal fatigue and thickness testing.\n\n- Comprehensive technical hazard reviews conducted at least every 5 years on processes using these RMP regulated chemicals and on design changes for production units before the changes are made. An excellent record keeping software program allows similar situations to be compared.\n\n- Distributed"

      "SummaryText": " control systems are used throughout the plant. They are interconnected which allows control to be shifted to another control station in the event of a computer system failure until full capability is restored.\n\n- We have highly sensitive monitoring instrumentation available that will detect very low concentrations of these materials.\n\n- The key to minimizing the effect of an accidental release is to get the right people and equipment to the location quickly. This includes both on-site and off-site emergency responders. All are well trained and experienced with our materials.\n\n- We have in-plant notification systems that can be used to summon our in-plant emergency responders.  Working through the Peoria County EMS and the County Sheriff's Department, we are able to summon necessary responders from the Timber Hollis Volunteer Fire Department and the Pekin Area Fire Departments. The emergency notification system can also be used to notify local residents of the need to \"Shelter-in-Place\" when conditions warrant it.\n\n- We have an extensive community emergency exercise history involving the above mentioned agencies. Our last planned community emergency exercise occurred on October 17, 2013. It involved emergency shutdown testing and \"Shelter-in-Place\" testing.\n\n- In 1989, the plant constructed a 100-year flood protection dike to protect the plant property from serious floods.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\n\n\nRecords for all accidental releases involving all chemicals at the facility are on kept on file. In the last five years, there have been no accidental releases that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off site deaths, injuries evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\n\n\nThe Mapleton facility's emergency response plan complies with the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119).

Emergency planning and Community Right-To-Know information as required under SARA Title III has been provided to the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and other appropriate agencies, such as the local fire department.  The facility interacts with various local agencies in its emergency planning such as the Local Emergency Planning Committee, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, and hospitals.  Employees receive annual training in the response plan and in the competencies relative to their required roles in the plan.  Periodic drills are conducted at the facility and may include participation by outside responding agencies.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nSafety improvements are a continual and ongoing process at the plant.  A formal process hazard analysis is conducted every five years, but review is constant through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation, and mechanical integrity programs.  As a result, changes relevant to safety occur as needs are identified through these procedures and policies.\n\n"
