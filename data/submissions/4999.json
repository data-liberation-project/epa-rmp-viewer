When the plant was originally built in 1938, it was a lime-soda softening \nplant which was then converted to a zeolite softening plant in 1956, and then to a conventional water treatment \nprocess in 1973.  A gaseous chlorine system is used for oxidation and disinfection of raw water.  The facility is \nequipped with chlorine gas detectors.\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO ARPP RULE \n\nThe Avenue WTP uses chlorine in quantities large enough to trigger the Environmental Protection Agencys \nAccidental Release Prevention Program (EPAs ARPP) and Californias Accidental Release Prevention Program \n(Cal ARPP).  One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are delivered to the plant by truck.  Typically, the City stores a \nmaximum of 10 one-ton chlorine cylinders onsite under a covered storage area and 4 one-ton chlorine cylinders \nwithin the chlorine dispensing room.  The covered storage area also has enough trunions to store an additional 5 \none-ton cylinders.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nThe facility has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or \nproperty damage.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is subject to OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) rule.  The City has developed a stringent PSM \nsafety program that includes the following elements:\n\n? Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed \nand installed.\n  \n? Updating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures.  All procedures \nmust be reviewed and certified annually.\n \n? Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training "

Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, with stringent documentation of all \ninspections.\n \n? Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n \n? Rigorous safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n \n? Stringent investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n \n? Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated systems.\n \n? Development of an effective emergency response plan.\n \n? Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM \nprogram, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n \n? Independent audits of the entire PSM program and RMP program every three years.\n \n \n EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES\n \n City staff uses its Emergency Action Plan to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the unlikely \nevent of an accidental release.  The key elements of the emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n \n? All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) are trained in the specific elements of the program.\n \n? The chlorine building is equipped with an electronic chlorine detector.  The chlorine detector has an audible \nalarm and alerts the Citys central operations control room in the event of a chlorine leak.\n \n? In the event of a large release, the facility would immediately contact the City of San Buenaventura Fire \nDepartment.  \n \n? A team of City supervisors and operators are fully trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials \n(HazMat) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.  The Fire Department and the City HazMat team \nwould jointly repair any major leaks.\n\n\nCI"

      "SummaryText": "TYS RECENT STEPS TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on recent safety reviews that were conducted as part of the evaluations for EPAs Accidental Release \nPrevention Program, the City has implemented the following actions to either reduce the likelihood or severity of \npotential chemical releases:\n\nNew Chlorine Facility and Chlorine Scrubber - The City plans to proceed with the construction of a new chlorine \nfacility with a chlorine gas scrubber system.\n\nRubber Mat  Provide rubber mat for unloading cylinders.\n\nWheel Chocks  Provide wheel chocks for the delivery trucks to assist with the unloading/loading of cylinders.\n\nOperating Procedures  Update written operating procedures to include all PSM-required information.\n\nLabeling  Improve labeling on process piping.\n\nSmoke Detectors - The City plans to install smoke detectors at the loading dock and the existing chlorine room.\n\nUpdate Emergency Repair Kit  The City will purchase rubber sheets that can be strapped around a damaged 1-ton \ncylinder to reduce leakage.  This repair method will be useful in reducing the impacts of an accident similar to the \nAlternate Release Scenario described below.\n\n\nHYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases.  EPA requires \nfacilities to model the distance that a plume of released gas would travel before it dispersed to an ambient \nconcentration equal to the Toxic Endpoint Concentration.  Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for various compounds \nwere specified by EPA, and are generally concentrations that would cause no physical harm but could interfere with \npeoples ability to leave the area.  The Toxic Endpoint Concentration for chlorine is 3 parts per million (ppm).  In \naccordance with EPAs rule, the following hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nLiquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temp"

The Administrative Worst-\nCase Release Scenario assumes that the entire contents of one of the chlorine cylinders (2000 pounds of chlorine) is \nemitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric \nconditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and F stability) which would result in minimal dispersion of the gas \ncloud as it blew downwind.  The thermodynamic properties of  chlorine indicate that such a large instantaneous gas \nrelease is probably impossible.  If the entire 2000 lbs of liquid chlorine were somehow discharged from the cylinder, \nit would spill on to the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a puddle of chlorine ice, which would \ntake much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas cloud.   Nevertheless, the RMP rule dictates that the \nWorst-Case Scenario assumes the release of 2000 lbs of gaseous chlorine. \n\nGraphs from EPAs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants were used to calculate the downwind \nimpacts.  EPAs graphs indicate that the chlorine gas cloud would travel 1.3 miles before it dispersed to the 3 ppm \nToxic Endpoint Concentration.  Figure 1 shows a circle defined by the worst-case 1.3 mile downwind distance. \n\nAlternate Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario for chlorine assumes that one of the 1-ton cylinders is dropped from the delivery \ntruck on to the ground outside the chemical building.  To be conservative it was assumed that the dropped cylinder \nlands on its weakest point, splitting a seam to cause an 8 x < crack.  It was also assumed that the dropped cylinder \ncomes to rest with the crack below the liquid level in the cylinder, allowing half of the liquid contents to \nimmediately drain on to the ground.  The thermodynamic properties of chlorine dictate that 12% of the spilled \nchlorine would immediately f"
