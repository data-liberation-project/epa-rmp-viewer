      "SummaryText": "waste water is discharged to \n\nHuggins Branch.  \n\n \n\nChlorine gas is injected into the water for disinfection purposes.  The chlorine system \n\nutilizes a Wallace & Tiernan vacuum operated, automatic switchover gaseous feed \n\nsystems with two 1-ton containers piped together to provide uninterrupted flow of \n\nchlorine.  Currently, the feed rate for chlorine ranges from approximately 30 \u00bf 100 \n\npounds per day.\n\n \n\nThe maximum chlorine inventory at the WWTP includes three 1-ton chlorine \n\ncontainers.  Under normal circumstances, a full container and a container in use are \n\npiped together and situated on the scale apparatus and a third 1-ton container is stored \n\nin an adjacent room separated by steel sliding doors that are kept closed unless \n\nemployees are in the Scale Room.\n\n \n\n3) Worst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nThe predicted worst-case release scenario for chlorine is a catastrophic release of one \n\n(full) chlorine container within the Scale Room.  This enclosure will limit the \n\ndispersion of both liquid and vapor to the atmosphere during a release.  For this \n\nscenario, 2,000 pounds of chlorine liquefied under pressure are assumed to be \n\nreleased in 10 minutes.  Using RMP*Comp Version 1.06 air dispersion modeling \n\nsoftware, the distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l is predicted to be 0.9 miles.  \n\n \n\nAs an input parameter for RMP*Comp, the topography surrounding the WWTP was \n\nconsidered \u00bfurban\u00bf.  It should be noted that this parameter is not directly correlated to \n\npopulation density.  Rather, the topography surrounding the facility is characterized \n\nas either having many obstructions \u00bf \u00bfurban\u00bf or generally flat with few obstructions \u00bf \n\n\u00bfrural\u00bf.  It was determined that because the WWTP was surrounded by trees and \n\nrolling hills, the topography would be characterized as \u00bfurban\u00bf for modeling \n\npurposes.\n\n \n\nThis 0.9 mile radius encompasses approximately 259 residences, and several \n\nindustries.  Assuming a population multiplier of 3.5 people per residenc"

      "SummaryText": "e, this radius \n\nencompasses approximately 910 people.  The number of residences and other public \n\nand environmental receptors associated with this radius was provided by Glasgow \n\nWater Company personnel from GIS data using the latitude and longitude of the \n\nfacility and a radius of 0.9 miles provided by EMPE.\n\n \n\n4) Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe proposed alternative release scenario for this facility is the rupture of a 3/8 inch \n\ndiameter flexible metal connector that conveys chlorine gas under pressure from the \n\nton container to the piping manifold.  As a result, a rupture of this line would result in \n\nan unmitigated discharge of chlorine vapor from the container.\n\n \n\nFor this release scenario, the delivery line is ruptured or severed and chlorine vapor \n\ndischarges from the end of the line at a pressure equal to that of the container.  It is \n\nassumed that the release occurs when the temperature of the container is 77 degrees F \n\nat a pressure is 113 pounds per square inch (psi).\n\n \n\nGiven a hole diameter of 0.11 inches at this temperature and pressure, RMP*Comp \n\ncalculated a release rate of 20.9 pounds of chlorine per minute.  The release will \n\nproceed at this rate for 1 hour, at which time the release is stopped by local \n\nemergency responders. \n\n \n\nOff-site consequences analysis using RMP*Comp resulted in a radius of impact of \n\n0.1 miles.  Using the methodology described in the worst-case scenario above, it was \n\ndetermined that there are no environmental or public receptors located within this \n\nradius.\n\n \n\nBecause the specific gravity of chlorine is 2.49 (air = 1.29), chlorine vapor is more \n\ndense than air.  As a result, chlorine vapor may collect and/or migrate along low-lying \n\nareas such as the Huggins Branch, to the southeast of the facility.  However, the \n\nmigration of chlorine vapor in the event of an actual release will be highly dependent \n\nupon the atmospheric conditions and release scenario at that time of the release.\n\n \n\n5) Genera"
