(GWF) stores and utilizes anhydrous ammonia at their power plant in Hanford, California.  It is GWF's policy to comply with all applicable governmental regulations.  Further, it is GWF's objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nGWF emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.  In addition to job specific training, operators and maintenance personnel receive training in fire prevention, fire control, accident prevention, safety, and first aid.  Additionally, an emergency action plan has been prepared for GWF and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nGWF has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard and 40 CFR Part 68 (RMP regulations).  At least every three years, GWF audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\nGWF Power Systems Company, Inc. built and operates a power plant located in Hanford, California.  This plant, which began operation during 1990, utilizes petroleum coke as a fuel to produce electricity.  \n\nAt the GWF Hanford Power Plant, there is one process that handles a regulated substance above the threshold quantity.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the fluidized bed combustion system to help control the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the exhaust stack.  This ammonia-based NOx reduction (DENOX) system involves the injection of ammonia vapor into each of the recycle cyclones in the fluidized bed combustion system.  \n\nAlthough anhydrous ammonia is a stable compound, it begins to dissociate into nitrogen and hydrogen at approximately 8500 F"

      "ESSeqNum": 1,
      "FacilityID": 4026,
      "SummaryText": ".  Since the recycle cyclones operate at approximately 17000 F, the ammonia rapidly dissociates to nitrogen and hydrogen.  The dissociated ammonia reacts with the oxides of nitrogen in the flue gas to form nitrogen gas and water.\n\nLiquid ammonia is stored in a 11,000 gallon (water capacity) storage tank at the plant.  The maximum fill capacity of the ammonia storage tank is limited due to a liquid level control system to 86.5 percent of the storage tank volume, which is slightly less than allowed by the American National Standard Institute's K61.1 safety requirements and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations published in Section 1910.111 of 29 CFR (and Section 509 of Title 8, CCR).  Assuming the unlikely event that ammonia is delivered at 300F, the storage tank could hold 50,879 pounds of ammonia at 86.5 percent of the storage capacity.\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm).  This concentration has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  \n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nOffsite consequence analyses are used as tools to assist in emergency response planning.  The RMP regulations require the owner or operator of a stationary source to analyze the offsite impacts due to an accidental release of a regulated substance.  The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 3 process must analyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  Since GWF's DENOX system is considered a Program 3 process, both release"

      "SummaryText": " scenarios were evaluated in the offsite consequence analyses.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential population within an area potentially affected by the accidental release scenario.  This area is defined as a circle with a radius equivalent to the distance the release would travel with concentrations at or above the endpoint.  The circle also defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be identified.\n\nThe worst-case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the contents of the single largest vessel or pipe within 10 minutes.  For liquefied gases stored under pressure, the entire contents of the vessel or pipe are assumed to be released as a vapor.  A total vapor release is highly unlikely.  However, this standardized worst-case scenario was developed for emergency response agencies to use for planning purposes.\n\nAn alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.  For GWF, the alternative release scenario was selected based on the results of the Hazard and Operability Study for the ammonia-based DENOX process.  The worst credible release event with the highest discharge rate would potentially have the greatest offsite impact.  A failure of the ammonia delivery hose was identified in the Hazard and Operability Study as the worst credible release event having the highest release rate, and therefore, was chosen as the alternative release scenario.   \n\nGWF has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  For the worst-case release scenario, the release of 50,880 lbs. of ammonia with a duration of 10 minutes, the plume would travel 2.6 miles at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  The population potentially affected within the worst-case release scenario circle for the GWF Hanford Power Plant is 2,200 persons.  The only sensitive receptors within this circle are schools.

      "SummaryText": "he U.S. Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps, there are no environmentally sensitive receptors within a worst-case release scenario circle.  \n\nGWF has installed passive and active mitigation systems to aid in the control of ammonia, if a release were to occur.  A concrete containment wall surrounds the ammonia storage and vaporizer system.  A release of liquid ammonia from the storage tank could be contained within this area.  The containment would limit the ammonia surface area in contact with the ambient air, thereby decreasing the rate of evaporation.  \n\nThe ammonia storage system also includes an ammonia monitoring system which is designed to alarm if the ambient ammonia concentration reaches 50 ppm.  If the ambient concentration reaches 100 ppm, the monitoring system will activate a water deluge system that will spray water onto and around the storage tank and over the truck unloading station.  Since ammonia is soluble in water, the deluge system could reduce the atmospheric ammonia concentration around the storage tank and possibly help mitigate certain releases.  In the event of a fire, this deluge system would cool the tank and help mitigate a temperature induced overpressure release.\n\nThe ambient ammonia monitoring system is designed to detect low concentrations of ammonia around the storage tank and alarm in the control room.  Early detection of a leak on the ammonia storage system may allow operations personnel to isolate the problem and limit any consequences of the release.\n\nThe ammonia storage tank is equipped with excess flow valves on the liquid and vapor pipelines.  Additionally, GWF has installed spring loaded isolation valves on the ammonia delivery pipelines.\n\nAlthough mitigation systems are installed, specific mitigation factors cannot be assigned to the systems in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance document.  Therefore, no mitigation factors were included in the modeling.  As such, "

For a release of 691 lb/min, the plume would travel 0.2 mile at concentrations at or above the endpoint.  \n\nGWF's Hanford Power Plant is located in an industrial area.  Based on observations of the area, there are no residences or sensitive receptors within 0.2 mile of the facility.  Therefore, there would be no population impacts from the alternative release scenario.  Also, based on a review of the U.S.G.S. maps, there are no environmentally sensitive receptors that would be affected by the alternative release scenario from the GWF Hanford Power Plant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical- Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed at GWF to address the anhydrous ammonia system.  The PSM program includes the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n    Written process safety information, including information pertaining to the hazards of ammonia, the technology of the process, and the equipment in the process has been compiled.\n\n    An initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed and has been updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n\n    Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least annually.\n\n    Safe work practices, such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into the facility have been developed and implemented.\n\n    Each employee involved in operating the ammonia system has received initial training and refresher training at least every three years.\n\n    Written mechanical integrity procedures have been established and implemented.\n\n    A Management of Change (MOC) program has been developed and implemented to address all propos"

The Director of Environmental and Safety Programs has the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of all of the RMP elements.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nGWF's Hanford Power Plant has had two accidental releases from the ammonia-based DENOX system that have resulted in offsite injuries in the last five years.  In both instances, a few people at the neighboring industrial facility were treated for inhalation at a local hospital.  Information on these accidents are included in the RMP*Submit.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nGWF has established an emergency action plan and a chain of command to respond to emergencies and to notify emergency responders when there is a need for a response.  However, an emergency response program does not need to be developed for the facilities since GWF employees will not respond to accidental releases of ammonia, the facilities are included in the community emergency response plan, and appropriate mechanisms are in place to notify emergency responders.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSince the PHAs were performed in Jan"

Discontinued the practice of \"burp\" venting the vaporizers.\n\n6)    Retrained employees at individual sites in valve line up, logbook entries, and lockout/tagout procedures.  \n\n7)    Changed the pressure control valve on each vaporizer.\n\n8)    Implemented hydrotesting procedures as part of the vaporizer inspections.\n\n9)    Replaced turbine meter flow transmitter with orifice plate flow transmitter.\n\n10)    Implemented monthly checks of all ammonia piping and valves outside of containment area.  \n\n11)    Added pressure transducer to the ammonia tank to allow board operators to check ammonia tank pressure (tank was already equipped with high/low alarms to the control room).\n\nThe following improvements will be completed by September 1, 1999 to improve safety:\n\n1)    Install an automated stop valve on the liquid line from the ammonia storage tank to the ammonia vaporizer.  If the ammonia tank pressure exceeds normal operating pressure limits, this stop valve will automatically close and isolate the ammonia tank from the vaporizer.  Activation of this isolation process will initiate an alarm in the control room and prevent further pressure increases by stopping the vaporization of liquid ammonia.\n\n2)    Add manual activation to the deluge system.\n\nCurrently, GWF is assessing a change from anhydrous ammonia to aqueous ammonia.  The potential impact of a release of aqueous ammonia would be significantly less than a release of anhydrous ammonia.  GWF is reviewing aqueous ammonia systems at other indu"
