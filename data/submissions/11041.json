The RMP document was prepared according to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA RMP Rule [1], \"Accidental Prevention Requirements, Risk Management Programs Under the Clear Air Act, Section 112(r)(7),\" June 20, 1996.  [CAA 112(r)(7)].\n\nThe Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products, such as gasoline, natural gas, propane and butane, from raw crude oil.  The Refinery is located in a heavy industrial area in Wilmington between the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, approximately two miles north of Terminal Island; it employs 414 full time staff.\n\nThe Refinery is comprised of forty-two processes, fourteen of which are subject to the Federal RMP Program Level 3 rules.  It must submit a single RMP for the entire refinery, because it handles several listed regulated substances that exceed RMP listed threshold quantities (TQ).\n\nIn complying with OSHA PSM and EPA RMP Program Level 3 requirements, the Refinery developed a Process Safety Risk Management System to address Accident Prevention and Emergency Response.  Refinery managers and supervisors in process engineering, project design engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety have primary responsibility for implementation and maintaining element compliance.  Mr. Steve Faichney has the designated authority for integration and continuous audit of all RMP elements. \n\nFor the past 5-years, the Refinery has had no accidents with offsite impacts.  Several minor accidental releases of hydrocarbons and toxic materials did occur.  However, neither injuries nor significant property damage occurred (on-site and off-site) due to the effectiveness of the Company's emergency response procedures.\n \nThe EPA regulated toxic materials handled are anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen sulfide, which are stored in quantities that exceed TQs."

      "SummaryText": "  \n\nThe SLAB dispersion model (a recognized public domain code) was used to determine which toxic releases would yield the greatest offsite distance and whether a release could impact a unique population group.   Based on these analyses, worst case toxic releases due to complete rupture of an HF surge drum produced the greatest offsite consequences, which encompassed potential worst case releases of the other toxic materials. Administrative control limits the vessel quantity to less than 87.5% of its maximum; this was considered in the evaluation. \n\nFour toxic \"alternative release scenarios\" were analyzed.  After a review of the Refinery's 5-year accident history and prior relevant California's Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP) studies, the alternative toxic release scenarios selected, which are considered more likely to occur than the worst case scenario) are: \n\n1. Rupture of a gasket in one of the lines from the ammonia storage vessel (V-9004) to the vaporizer, resulting in a release of anhydrous ammonia from a 1/64\" valve seal opening (valve seat diameter = 2 inches). The resulting ERPG-2 (200 ppm or 0.14 mg/L) endpoint distance, 0.13 miles using the SLAB model, barely impacts offsite receptors.\n\n2. Release of hydrogen fluoride from a flexible hose between a truck and an HF storage drum, and spill of liquefied HF to grade.  Water curtains will reduce the quantity of HF vapor released to the air by at least 90%.  The ERPG-2 (20 ppm or 0.016 mg/L) endpoint distance using the SLAB model is 0.38 miles, which wil have a minor impact to about 50 residents to the north and south-east of the facility. \n\n3. Release of hydrogen sulfide from a pipe between a vessel and vessel valve. It was conservatively assumed that the total contents of hydrogen sulfide in the process would be released before termination measures could be implemented. The ERPG-2 (30 ppm or 0.042 mg/L) endpoint distance for this alternative scenario using the SLAB model is 0.2 miles, which resu"

The resulting ERPG-2 (200 ppm or 0.14 mg/L) endpoint distance using the SLAB model is 0.05 miles, which has no offsite impacts.\nThe refinery handles regulated flammable materials in several processes.  \n\nTwo co-located tanks containing liquid n-butane store the largest inventories of flammable materials.  The n-butane tank located closest to the fence-line was selected as the only candidate worst case scenario for flammable substances.  All other inventories of flammable materials stored at the Refinery would, if released catastrophically, produce a 1-psi overpressure endpoint that is encompassed by a release from the selected tank containing n-butane.  There are no administrative controls and passive mitigation measures were not considered.  Therefore, the full n-butane inventory was assumed to release, completely vaporize and explode, resulting in a VCE.  Using the RMP worst-case assumption, the maximum distance to the 1-psi overpressure endpoint for this vapor cloud explosion is 0.78 miles, which would affect about 1200 residents surrounding the plant.\n\nBased on a review of the Refinery's 5-year accident history and California's RMPP studies, the most likely alternative scenario is a leak in the 2-inch discharge line of a butane vessel.  A trained operator will likely isolate the leak within 10 minutes.  Such a release could result in a pool fire, a flash fire, a BLEVE, or a VCE.  A BLEVE was considered unlikely, but the others were analyzed to determine which produced the greatest flammable endpoint.  Of these, radiant heat from a pool fire yields the greatest endpoint distance of 1,256 feet.  The effects of this pool fire were determined using the methods published in the RMP OCA Guidance Document, Appendix D.\n\nThe Refinery "
