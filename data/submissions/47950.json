Ammonia is a hazardous substance that must be handled properly in order to prevent accidental releases and injuries.  It is the policy of the C&S Wholesale facility located in North East, Maryland to conduct all operations (including the ammonia refrigeration system) in a safe manner.  This policy extends to all employees and contractors at the facility.  C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - North East implements this policy towards chemical and general safety through on-going employee participation, training, written operating procedures, maintenance, inspections, safety committee meetings, and safety reviews/evaluations.  These programs are in effect at the facility to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  In the event of an ammonia accident, the facility has an Emergency Action Plan to notify the appropriate authorities and safely evacuate the facility.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nC&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. is located at 100 Lums Road, in North East, Maryland.  The facility is approximately 0.5 miles south of Interstate 95.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is rural with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas.  Construction of the original ammonia refrigeration system at C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc.'s North East facility was completed in 1988.  The recent expansion of the facility and the ammonia refrigeration system was completed in early 2007.  The ammonia system was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and to IIAR guidelines.\n\nThe primary business of C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - North East is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 23,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration"

Typical operating conditions range from 33 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side of the system.  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n1) OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM); and\n2) EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP); \n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site workers.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - North East to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - North East's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely comp"

      "SummaryText": "lete job requirements.\n\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility has also installed ammonia sensors at strategic locations throughout the facility which will alarm at 25 and 300 ppm in the Engine Room, and 25 ppm in the dock, penthouse and cooler room areas.  When the detectors alarm, they terminate the supply of ammonia to the area of the warehouse in which the detection occurred.  This prevents the quantity released from escalating.  In the event of a release while the facility is unmanned, the auto dialer alarm system will notify the C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. - North East Plant Engineer.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc. \u00bf North East facility accident history revealed that there had been no ammonia - related accidents at the facility to report.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:  \n\n\u00bf save lives;\n\u00bf minimize and avoid injuries;\n\u00bf protect the environment; and\n\u00bf minimize property damage.\n\nFacility personnel will respond to an ammonia release at the facility that poses a health or safety threat, the Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility, as well as response criteria.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM, and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency evacuation procedures."
