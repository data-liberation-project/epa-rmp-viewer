The Dickinson Plant has a history of commitment to public and employee safety. Our commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention such as safety and operations training of our personnel, incident investigations, and standards for design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy at Calumet Penreco is to implement reliable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe Calumet Penreco Dickinson Plant has been a member of the Dickinson community since 1942 and is in the business to convert refined base oils into food grade mineral oils and petroleum sulfonates. Pennzoil Products Company purchased the plant in 1985 from Marathon Morco Company and made it a part of the company's Penreco Division. In 1997, Pennzoil Products Company and Conoco, Inc. entered into a joint venture agreement and formed an independently operated Penreco Company. As of 1998, Pennzoil-Quaker State Company and Conoco, Inc. jointly own the Penreco Company. M. E. Zuckerman Specialty Oil Corporation purchased Pennzoil-Quaker State Company's 50% interest in the Penreco joint venture in February 2001. Conoco merged with Phillips Petroleum Company in August 2002 to become ConocoPhillips Company. In January of 2008, Calumet Specialty Products acquired Penreco to form Calumet Penreco.\n\n\n\nThe plant is located at Park Avenue and Nichols Street in Dickinson, Texas. The plant covers an area of approximately 28 acres, which consists of the north and south property bisected by Park Avenue and the east Dickinson Bayou property. The main plant is located on the north property (10 acres) and consists of all the process units and related tankage. Located on the south property (10 acres) are a m"

The distribution center encompasses drum filling and storage, tank truck loading operations, white oil blending and finished white oil bulk storage. The east Dickinson Bayou property (8 acres) was purchased in 1989 and is presently undeveloped.\n\n\n\nThe facility has seven distinct operating areas: the white oil unit, the yellow oil unit, the sodium bisulfite unit, crude sulfonate processing, spent salt processing, bio-diesel production, and crude trans-loading operations. \n\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nThe plant has one Risk Management Program regulated toxic chemical, oleum, fuming sulfuric acid, over the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. Oleum is a chemical raw material used in the manufacturing and processing of many products at Calumet Penreco. Oleum is received only by tank truck and stored in two storage tanks. At the Dickinson Plant, oleum is used in the production of white and yellow oils by contacting lube oil feedstocks with oleum. The acid contact process produces a non-reactive food-grade white oil approved for human consumption. Penreco's white oils form the basic ingredient in such consumer products as baby oil, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. \n\n\n\nSulfur dioxide, a toxic gas, is also present in the plant, but at quantities well below the threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds. The operational processes containing sulfur dioxide were evaluated and determined to have no potential impact to the community in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances\n\n\n\nThe plant has no Risk Management Program (RMP) regulated flammable materials above the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The plant utilizes propane cylinders for forklift operation, but the quantity is well below the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds and poses no potential off-site impact.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATE CASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nCalumet Penreco evaluated the worst-case scenario and one altern"

Calumet Penreco does not believe that these events are likely to occur because of the preventative controls in place at the plant.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nAlthough the Oleum processes at the plant is not regulated by the OSHA PSM Standard, the facility has chosen to utilize appropriate PSM elements to address EPA RMP regulation requirements based on the fact that the facility is already addressing the OSHA PSM standard for another chemical on OSHAs hazardous chemical list and above the threshold limit.\n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe Dickinson Plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, participation as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team and participation on the Plant Safety Review Committee. In addition, employees participate on monthly safety and housekeeping inspections and also serve as investigation team members for all plant accidents and/or incidents. Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant's accident prevention program. In addition, the plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, shipping, laboratory, and plant management.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Dickinson Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of our various processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility "

Information summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan and the plant's process safety manual. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, level, pressure and composition) and this information is an intricate part of our process operating procedures. The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g. automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features or systems in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe Dickinson Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate safeguards or controls are in place to manage these hazards. The plant utilizes the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis and the "

The What-If technique is also utilized for less complicated or hazardous processes. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identified and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. To help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and whenever significant changes in the process so warrant. These reviews continue at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe Dickinson Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal s"

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. In addition, the plant maintains process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through testing, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, we evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection process of a contractor. Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  Calumet has enlisted ISNetworld for maintaining safety, insurance, quality and regulatory information on all contractors hired to work at the Dickinson facility.  ISN facilitates the collection of self-reported information from contractors and maintains it in a centralized database.  This helps Calumet track training qualifications, incidents, insurance and safety and health programs.  Contractors are benchmarked to measure their safety and health programs and gauge their performance and drive improvement.  \n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEWS (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Dickinson Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review also provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspection and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. Maintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. thickness testing for piping and pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service (if possible), or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment. \n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The plant also incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\n\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\n\n\n\nThe plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and"

The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to the Oleum Process (Program 3) EPA RMP-covered process at the plant. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors. In addition to the accident prevention program, the plant has safety features on process units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n(1)    Area and perimeter toxic gas detectors"

Our Emergency Response Team (ERT) members volunteer to serve the plant and the surrounding community in fire prevention and suppression, hazardous material release response, and confined space and elevated personnel rescue. Our ERT receives both on-site and off-site comprehensive training. The DVFD and Fire Marshall tour plant operating units, participate in joint emergency drill exercises and pre-plan emergency contingencies. We have 24-hour communication capabilities with local agencies through our mutual aid emergency portable radio. Calumet Penreco's emergency communications are tested weekly to maintain their operational readiness. In addition, Penreco allocates funding for several DVFD personnel to attend the Texas A&M University Industrial Fire and Rescue School. \n\n\n\nThe plant's emergency response programs consists of procedures for responding to all types of emergencies such as, the release of regulated substances, fire/explosion, evacuation, medical treatment, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, severe weather (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes) and post-incident clean-up and decontamination requirements.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant takes the following actions:\n\n(1)    Alarm is activated and radio announcement made to all personnel\n\n(2)    Site and area assessment is made and local emergency agencies notified by \"911\"\n\n(3)    Emergency protection systems are activated immediately\n\n(4)    The site area command post is activated (if necessary)\n\n(5)    Plant management and technical resources assist emergency responders as needed\n\n(6)    Emergency Commander declares an \"All Clear\" and local command posts notified as required\n\n\n\nEqually important, local residents would be notified by the Dickinson Emergency Alert System to shelter in place (effective method for personal protection) and instructed to take the following"
