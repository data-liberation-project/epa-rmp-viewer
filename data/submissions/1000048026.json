The Expera Old Town Mill has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations that may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors.\r\n\r\nExpera Old Town has a commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\r\n\r\nExpera Old Town plans to meet or surpass all regulatory requirements.

Pulp is produced on one Kamyr continuous digesters. The pulp from the digester is piped to the bleach plant. The bleaching operations use chlorine dioxide, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Emissions from the chlorine dioxide stages of the bleach plant are collected and scrubbed with white liquor in a packed tower scrubber. Chlorine dioxide is generated on-site and stored as a dilute aqueous solution. The emissions from this process are also controlled by a packed tower scrubber.\r\n\r\n2.\tRegulated Substances and Process\r\nExpera Old Town, LLC operates a process that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance: chlorine dioxide generation and storage.

In 1999, the Old Town Mill replaced the chlorine bleaching system with an elemental chlorine-free system. The new system consists of chlorine dioxide oxidizing bleaching system. This change has resulted in the complete phase out of elemental chlorine from the mill. The use of chlorine dioxide greatly reduces the risks of any potential off-site impacts associated with an accidental release, while also reducing the quantity of organically bound halide effluents produced in the bleaching process. The elimination of elemental chlorine in the bleaching process has reduced the worst-case distance to toxic endpoint. Expera Old Town LLC believes that the conversion to an elemental chlorine-free bleaching process reduces potential risks to its employees, the local communities, and the environment.\r\n\r\nH.\tHazard Assessment\r\n\r\nThe hazard assessment evaluates the off site consequences of accidental releases on public and environmental receptors. Pubic receptors are off site residences, institutions (such as schools and hospitals), commercial, and office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public at any time where members of the public could be exposed to toxic concentrations, radiant heat, or overpressure, as a result of an accidental release.

These analyses comprise the hazard assessment.\r\n\r\nI.\tWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis for a Toxic Substance Release\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance at Expera Old Town LLC is a hypothetical release of the entire contents of a storage tank containing 190,000 gallons of chlorine dioxide solution. In accordance with the definition of worst case for toxic gases under RMP regulations, the entire 18,235 lbs of chlorine dioxide, in solution, were assumed to be released over a ten minute period. Based on the structural integrity of the tank and interconnected piping, Expera Old Town LLC considers such an event to have an extremely small probability of occurrence and, thus, not of practical interest in terms of risk management and emergency response planning. Therefore, such a scenario is included in the Risk Management Plan for administrative completeness.\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than that of ambient air. For this reason, a concentrated plume resulting from a large accidental release would display dense-gas behavior. That is, the near-field dispersion would be controlled by gravitational slumping caused by the density difference. EPA's 1996 RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) lists a number of refined dense-gas dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs. Among these models is the Dense Gas Dispersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1). DEGADIS, developed by the U.S Co"

DEGADIS has therefore been used to model the chlorine dioxide worst-case release.\r\n\r\nThe modeling was conducted using the prescribed weather conditions of 1.5 meters per second wind speed and F stability. These low dispersion conditions are common at night with fair skies. No passive mitigation measures were considered for this hypothetical release.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe toxic endpoint for chlorine dioxide is set by regulation to 1 ppm (0.0028 mg/L). This is equal to the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) level of 10 ppm, divided by a safety factor of 10 to account for sensitive individuals. The IDLH, developed by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is intended to protect healthy workers from irreversible health effects or escape-impairing symptoms for exposures of up to 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance. 'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees. 'Rural' indicates that there are few buildings or forests and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of Expera Old Town, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature, whereas at greater distances, the surface roughness is more 'rural', especially along the Penobscot River.

This is reflected in the use of a low 10 cm surface roughness in DEGADIS.\r\n\r\nThe modeling indicated a maximum distance of 9.3 miles to chlorine dioxide's toxic endpoint of 1 ppm (0.0028 mgIL). Figure 1 illustrates the hypothetical 9.3-mile radius. The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 32,500, based on the 2000 Federal Census (Census 2000 TIGER/Line Data). The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, public recreation areas, environmental receptors (Sunkhaze Refuge) and industrial/commercial areas.\r\n\r\nJ.\tAlternate Release Scenario for Chlorine Dioxide\r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide solution is pumped from generation and storage to the bleach plant through a 6 inch diameter pipeline. The chlorine dioxide pipeline is supported by a pipe bridge, which is approximately 250 feet long. Normal solution strength is about 10.5 grams per liter.\r\n\r\nThis alternate-scenario is the rupture of the 6-inch diameter chlorine dioxide pipeline on the pipe bridge inside the bleach plant. It is assumed that the approximately 250 feet of pipe would drain before the flow could be shutdown. This would release 32.21bs of C1O2.\r\n\r\nAlternative dispersion modeling was conducted using the U.S. EPA's RMP*CompTM (Version 1.07) software. In accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.
