      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nICM Biofuels, LLC\r\n\r\nICM Biofuels, LLC (ICMB) will acquire operational control of the ethanol facility at LifeLine Foods, LLC March 1st, 2014. Original operations initiated in October 2007.  ICMB will review on-site plans on a regular basis and updates them when necessary.  There has been management changes at the facility, but none that have affected the responsible official. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response Policies:\r\n\r\nICMB has a commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel as well as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.\r\n\r\nICMB's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, plant personnel will respond to contain the release as necessary.\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nICMB is located in St. Joseph, Buchanan County, Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for the purpose of manufacturing fuel grade ethanol from corn.  The regulated substances under the RMP program are Anhydrous Ammonia and Denaturant (also known as natural gasoline which is a flammable mixture).  ICMB has determined that the radius of impact from a worst-case release of ammonia would be about 3.3  miles and a worst-case release of denaturant would be about 0.5 miles; due to the amount of ammonia and denaturant stored on site.\r\n\r\nOff-site Consequence Analysis Results:\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenarios at the facility are the release of all 77,760 pounds of ammonia creating a toxic cloud, or release of 560,000 pounds of denaturant causing a vapor cloud explosion.  \r\n\r\nFor ammonia, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of all ammonia stored on site.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 3.3 miles from the center of"

      "SummaryText": "the plant.  Residence homes, schools and other public receptors are located within this 3.3 mile radius.\r\n\r\nFor denaturant, the worst-case scenario is based on the release of the maximum volume of the denturant tank, located in the tank farm.  The worst case vapor cloud endpoint is approximately 0.5 miles from the center of the plant.  Residence homes, schools, and other public receptors are located within this 0.5 mile radius.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenarios for ICMB are the release of 2,430 pounds of ammonia from an excess flow valve failure over 15 minutes time, and the release of 39,200 pounds of denturant from a tanker truck rolling over on ICMB's property.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release vapor cloud toxic endpoint is approximately 0.1 mile from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this radius.  Denaturant's alternative release scenario has an endpoint of approximately 0.2 mile from the center of the plant.  Residence homes and other public receptors are located within this radius.\r\n\r\nICMB has numerous controls in place to prevent releases and to manage potential consequences, no active or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe facility qualifies as a Program 3 due to the close proximity of public receptors, and therefore, Program Safety Management has been completed for this facility.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents since the establishment of the ethanol facility.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Information:\r\n\r\nICMB has several safety programs in place at the facility that incorporate emergency response, including a Health and Safety Plan.  A SPCC and FRP have been prepared and implemented in accordance with applicable regulatory standards.  FRP regulations requires excercises of internal and external notification systems on a semiannual to annual basis.\r\n\r\nICMB's corporate policy places the utmost importance on worker, public and"
