Pilot Chemical is committed to the maintenance of a quality management system which meets the requirements of the International Standards Organization ISO 9002.  This commitment requires the work force to focus on the production of a quality product through continuous improvement in all phases of its operations.\n\nThe Pilot Chemical Company of Ohio, Middletown Plant occupies 27 acres in an open, relatively flat, combination rural and industrial area, southwest of Middletown, Ohio.  The original facility was constructed in 1984 with building additions in 1995 and process additions in 1995 and 1998.  The facility produces detergent grade sulfonic acid, synthetic detergents, surfactants and emulsifiers through continuous sulf(on)ation and neutralizer systems for use in the industrial and personal care markets.\n\nThe regulated substances on site exceeding threshold quantities are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, both of which are toxics, and Isopropylamine which is a flammable liquid.\n\nSulfur Dioxide is a clear, water-white liquid at temperatures below its atmospheric-pressure boiling point of 14 deg. F.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored on site as a liquefied, compressed gas at a pressure near 100 psi.  Sulfur Dioxide vapors are colorless and heavier than air, but are extremely irritating and suffocating at concentrations above 30 ppm.  With a distinctive rotten egg smell, Sulfur Dioxide has good warning properties with a odor threshold of 0.5 ppm.  Sulfur Dioxide is stable and non-flammable in either the gaseous or liquid state.\n\nSulfur Trioxide is a clear, colorless, oily liquid at temperatures between its freezing and boiling points, which are 90 deg. F and 113 deg. F respectively.  Sulfur Trioxide has a strong irritating odor and is very hygroscopic, reacting violently with water.  Sulfur Trioxide fumes react with the moisture in the air to form a dense,"

This mist is extremely irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory system.\n\nIsopropylamine is a colorless, water-white, highly flammable liquid with a strong ammoniacal odor.  Isopropylamine evaporates readily evolving vapor that is heavier than air and easily ignited.  Isoproplyamine is completely soluble in water and will not ignite at a concentration below 25%.\n\nIndustries and residences are at least 600 feet from the main building containing the sulfonation processes and from  the Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide storage tanks.   The Isopropylamine storage tank is 400 feet from the nearest industrial area and residence and 200 feet from the process building.\n\nThis facility has in place an accidental release prevention program that complies with all of the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  In addition:\n\u00b7 Sensitive Sulfur Dioxide and flammable vapor detection systems are installed with monitors located in strategic locations throughout the processing areas to alert plant personnel of leaks.\n\u00b7 The facility undergoes annual safety inspections by the Middletown Fire Department and our insurance company.\n\u00b7 Before beginning any maintenance operation involving hot work, a Hot Work permit must be completed and signed by both production and engineering.\n\u00b7 The computer controlled processes are Fail safe and include emergency shutdown capability that close isolation valves and stop chemical transfers to effectively limit the extent of a release.  Instruments continuously monitor pressure, temperature and level in critical process vessels and automatically alarm if a parameter exceeds acceptable ranges.  Equipment interlocking is utilized to prevent operation under unsafe conditions.\n\u00b7 All manual and automated valves in the Isopropylamine system have fusible links so that the valves automatically close in the event of a fire.\n\u00b7 An extensive operator training program is in place that utilizes a combination o"

Operators receive training on new and revised operating procedures as well as personal and process safety.\n\u00b7 All incidents are investigated, including very small drips and leaks, and actions are taken to prevent recurrence.\n\u00b7 An extensive mechanical integrity program is in place which includes equipment preventive maintenance schedules, vessel thickness testing, relief system inspections and instrumentation calibration.\n\u00b7 Pre-startup reviews are held prior to starting new or modified equipment per OSHA standards.\n\u00b7 Routine audits of operating procedures and work instructions are conducted to assure that safe practices are followed.\nThis facility has had no reportable accidents with off site consequences within the past 5 years.  In addition no onsite reportable injuries involving Sulfur Dioxide, Sulfur Trioxide or Isopropylamine have occurred since startup of the facility in 1984.\n\nBecause we believe that in the event of a chemical accident quick response is necessary to minimize the likelihood of onsite or offsite injuries, an extensive emergency response plan has been developed.  In addition to the written plan:\n\u00b7 All employees receive annual training on the use of the emergency response and evacuation plans, use of personal protective equipment, operation of fire extinguishers and spill mitigation techniques.\n\u00b7 Currently, 9 plant personnel are trained at the 40 hour industrial emergency responder Technician level.  Each technician receives annual refresher training.\n\u00b7 The facility has a working relationship with the Middletown Fire Department.\n\u00b7 Emergency response drills are performed regularly.\n\u00b7 Emergency response equipment is on site including a plant wide breathing air system.\n\u00b7 A plant wide emergency notification system is in place.\nAs a part of our commitment to continuous improvement planned changes to improve safety at the facility include:\n\u00b7 Updating th"
