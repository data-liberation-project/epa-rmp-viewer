The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential to employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers.\n\nManagement is committed to  providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is incouraged and supported by management.\nKey perssonnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the chlorine system.  Employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\n\nThe policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities in accordance with the most current building and safety codes.  This ensures the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project.\nWe are committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures.  Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during his or her initial orientation for the facility.\nIn addition, we conduct regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year.  Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the systems they are responsible for.  Members of the plant emergency response team recieve annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and saely completed.\n\nFacility Description\n\nThis facility utilizes flour mills to produce flour.

Support operations include a chlorine system, a quality control laboratory, and administrative offices.\nOne chemical is utilized at this facility, in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, RMP.  The chemical is chlorine and is used to bleach or age the flour.\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative-Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for chlorine included a release of all the contents of one of the 2000 pound chlorine cylinders in a 10 minute period (per EPA guidelines), translating to a release of 200 lbs/min.\nOther assumptions included are: the cylinder is not diked; the release is mitigated by enclosure which reduces the release by 55%; the nearfield dispersion environment is urban; the wind speed is 1.5 m/sec.\nand the atmospheric stability is classified as F (stable); the plume must travel 3.5 miles before dispersing to the endpoint concentration of 3.0 PPM.\n\nThe selected alternative-release scenario for the chlorine system is a release resulting from damage or rupture of the chlorine vapor line (pigtail) from the ton chlorine cyulinder to the chlorine manifold.  The pigtail has an inside diameter of 3/8 inch.  The alternative-release rate was derived by an equation including puncture area, tank pressure, tank temperature, and Gas Factor (EPA guidance document Appendix B, Exhibit B-1).  From Reference table 17: Dense Gas Distances to Toxic Endpoint - 60 Minute Release, Urban Conditions, D Stability, Wind Speed 3.0 m/sec., resulted in the distance to the endpoint concentration of 0.0087 mg/l being 0.27 miles.  Passive mitigation measure (enclosure) is in place and reduces the release by 55%.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility is goverened by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities intended to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release occu"

These personnel recieve annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAmerican Ingredients and Siemer Milling Company complete a thorough review of the chlorine systems each time a design change is implemented.  The system is also evaluated each time the PHA is revised.  We are committed to using these methjods to identify and implement ways to improve the safety of these systems."
