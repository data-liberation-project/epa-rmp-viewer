      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR THE CITY OF SANDUSKY'S BIG ISLAND WATER WORKS RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nGENERAL \nThe Sandusky Big Island Water Works is a municipally-owned and operated water purification facility. Chlorine is used in the potable water treatment process for disinfection. The existing chlorination system utilizes gaseous chlorine and is comprised of equipment in the Chlorine Building. The City routinely maintains 8,000 to 16,000 pounds of chlorine on site and is required to comply with RMP regulations. \nChlorine is delivered to the Big Island Water Works in one ton steel containers or cylinders. A loading area is provided just north of the Chlorine Building to unload full cylinders from a delivery truck into storage. Full cylinders are removed from the delivery truck using two different means. \n1.Open flat bed truck delivery: The delivery truck back under the monorail. The monorails hoist lefts the full cylinders off the truck and place them inside the chlorine building.  \n2.Enclosed bay truck delivery: The cylinder are unloaded by using a fork lift and are set below a monorail and hoist for transporting into the Chlorine Building. \n\nEmpty cylinders are loaded onto the truck for return to the chlorine supplier in a similar manner. Outdoor storage of full or empty chlorine containers is prohibited.\nChlorine gas is supplied under pressure to both a dual pre- chlorination unit and a dual post chlorination unit and is mixed with water to produce a chlorine solution. Chlorine solution is supplied under pressure to the filter effluent piping and to a rapid mix chamber for disinfection purposes. Typical chlorine feed rates are 150 lbs./day for pre-chlorination and 50 lbs/day for post-chlorination. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \nThe Sandusky Big Island Water Works approach to chemical safety focuses on training and safety awareness. Plant operators are annually trained on operational and safety practices associated with chlorine and chlorin"

      "SummaryText": "e feed equipment. The training program currently utilizes presentations by local chlorine supply professionals to routinely refresh operators understanding and knowledge base on the safe handling procedures and accident prevention procedures for chlorine. The Sandusky Water Plant is secure facility and only authorized plant personnel maintain and handle the chlorine containers and feed equipment. \nBecause of the City's commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures for the chlorine facilities, new policies, procedures and instructional programs have been developed in conjunction with completion of this Risk Management Plan. A new, updated Emergency Response Plan has been prepared. The City will continue to coordinate with the City of Sandusky Fire Department in this regard and will have better defined procedures in conjunction with its participation. A new management program, training program and Operations and Maintenance Manual have also been developed and will be utilized by the Water Plant staff to safety manage and operate the chlorine facilities in the near future. \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \nThe worst case scenario assumes the complete release of a one ton chlorine cylinder within the prescribed 10 minute period. The model used for this scenario is USEPA's RMP Comp. The distance to the worst case scenario endpoint would be 3.00 miles. Passive mitigation factors were used in the RMP Comp model as all chlorine is stored indoors. \n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO \nThe alternative release scenario assumes a feed line leak from a one ton cylinder in service. For this scenario, a total of 1,845 pounds of chlorine would be released over a 15 minute period. The distance to the endpoint would be 0.6 miles. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS \nThe Sandusky Big Island Water Works complies with the OSHA Rules and Regulations with respect to the Accidental Release Prevention Program. Chemical specific prevention steps"

There have been no accidental chlorine releases in the known history of the plant which resulted in injury to off-site personnel or evacuations. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nThe key element of the Emergency Response Program is the written Emergency Response Plan on file at Big Island Water Treatment Plant and at offices of the City in downtown Sandusky. The written Plan Includes a Quick Reference Guide which allows an operator to immediately and positively act in case of an observed or detected chlorine leak. The Erie County Local Emergency Planning Committee is the overall coordinator of emergency response services. The EC, EMA maintain its current approach to first contact the City of Sandusky Fire Department in case of an emergency as part of the County's current program. Additional notification procedures are also defined. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes first aid procedures, medical management of chlorine exposure information, emergency response training and pre-emergency coordination guidelines. A summary of emergency chlorine leak response procedures is also included. \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \nThe City of Sandusky has committed to review and follow the guidelines presented in the Emergency Response Plan, Training Program and Management Program. \n\n"
