Facility Identification\nThe Carl Buddig facility is located at 50 West Taft Drive in South Holland, Illinois.  The facility is a producer of specialty meats.\n\nThe NAICS code the facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve ingredients, raw materials, and finished goods.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule.  There are two (2) ammonia refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating meat products.\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the East refrigeration system is approximately 16,000 pounds.  The East refrigeration system is used to cool production rooms, holding coolers, and the office area.  This system is a single stage system with five (5) high stage compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator.  \n\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the West refrigeration system is approximately 14,000 pounds.  The East refrigeration system is used to cool production areas and holding coolers.  It is a single stage system with three (3) high stage compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure liquid from the receiver, through the accumulator.\n\nThe total amount of ammonia onsite, considering the quantities in the East and West systems, is approximately 30,000 pounds, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nA topographic map identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.  \n\nIV. Hazard Assessment - Worst Csae Scenario (WCS)\nAppendix B consists of the RMP Submit Printout and conatins additional information on the worst-case scenario.

Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario.  \n\nVI. General Accidental Release Prevention Plan \nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.  However, as discussed throughout this document Carl Buddig and Company is actively working on improving this program.\n\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.  The next audit of the PSM program will occur by August 24, 2007, in compliance with the requirement to conduct PSM audits every three years.  The elements of the PSM, Program 3 prevention program and a brief description are listed below.\n- Employee Participation - Carl Buddig has updated a site specific employee participation plan that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.\n- Process Safety Information - Carl Buddig maintains a site specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained.  \n- Process Hazard Analysis - Carl Buddig has updated a site specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted, at a minimum, every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented.
