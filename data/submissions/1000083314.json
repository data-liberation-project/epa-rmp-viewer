DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US, Inc.  will also be taking operational control of Anhydrous HCl High Purity and Propylene Oxide at the same time. Operational control of the Anhydrous HCl Low Purity asset is scheduled to be transferred in early 2020. This submittal removes all processes, programs, covered chemicals and scenarios that will not belong to Dow Agrosciences, LLC going forward. \n\n\n\nRemoval of Regulated Substances:\n\nRemoved Anhydrous HCl from Building 1 since the plant has blown out the pipeline within their block limits and installed a blind flange to the site header on May 13th, 2019. They are no longer using anhydrous HCl at their facility. \n\n\n\nNon-Applicability for Anhydrous HCl due to Removal of Interconnectivity:\n\nChanged the 680 and 1028 plants to non-applicable for Anhydrous HCl, since they have less than the applicable threshold limit within their block.  These plants were only applicable for Anhydrous HCl before due to interconnectivity with the site header which was owned by Dow Agrosciences, LLC. Now that the site header and distribution asset for Anhydrous HCl is owned by DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US, Inc., the interconnectivity definition doesn't apply.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nDow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive"

Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with the City of Midland Fire Department and Midland LEPC which can provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nDow AgroSciences, LLC Midland Operations primary activity is chemical manufacturing, including agricultural and specialty chemicals.  There are three (3) covered processes, eight (8) programs and eight (8) regulated substances present at the stationary source.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substances are listed below.  \n\nRegulated Substances:\n\n\n\nAmmonia (anhydrous)\n\nChlorine\n\nCrotonaldehyde [2-butenal]\n\nDimethylamine\n\nPhosphorus oxychloride\n\nPhosphorus trichloride\n\nSulfur dioxide\n\nVinylidene chloride\n\n\n\nWorst and Alternative Case Scenario Selection\n\n\n\nThere was one (1) worst case toxic and one (1) worst case flammable scenario reported in this submittal. There are seven (7) total alternate cases, one of which is a flammable case.  Most of the toxic alternate cases were reported due to that being the only alternate case for the chemical.  No toxic alternate cases for chlorine impacted a population, so the scenario reported for chlorine was the only alternate case that reached an endpoint off-site. The flammable alternate case was chosen due to it being the closest scenario to affect a population based on the location in the plant.  It has the closest scenario with an endpoint to an off-site location. EPA RMP*Comp and MARPLOT were used to evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios. \n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nDow "
