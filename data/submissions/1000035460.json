      "SummaryText": "The City of Sweetwater, Texas (City), operates the Sweetwater Water Treatment Plant (WTP) located in Nolan County, Texas. The WTP provides potable water to the City of Sweetwater, City of Trent, City of Roby, and Bitter Creek Water Supply Corporation (WSC). Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the water treatment plant with up to ten (10) 2,000-pound chlorine cylinders stored on-site at any one time. The City also uses 19% ammonium hydroxide (19% available aqueous ammonia) in its treatment plant which is not a covered process subject to risk management planning. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Sweetwater WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)). A Management System overseen by the City's Director of Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  There is no history of a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or"

      "SummaryText": "off-site, within the previous five (5) years (\u00a768.42(a)).  As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\r\n\r\nThe Sweetwater WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Sweetwater WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response.  The Sweetwater WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Sweetwater WTP.  The City of Sweetwater's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the county-wide Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b))."
