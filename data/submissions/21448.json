Propane and butane are each stored in 4,200,000 gallon capacity underground caverns, and isobutane is stored in a 2,000,000 gallon capacity cavern.  The products are transported from the facility by pipeline.\n\nProcess controls in place at the facility, to prevent or minimize an emergency release, include automatic and manual shutoffs, alarms, vents, relief and check valves, excess flow devices, and grounding equipment.  In addition, the facility has UV/IR fire detection \"eyes\" process area detectors. \n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for this facility is a release from the propane storage cavern due to aboveground piping failure, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The quantity of propane that could be released in the WCS is estimated to be 420,000 gallons (1,800,000 pounds).  Under EPA requirements, the WCS assumes weather conditions that allow the chemical to travel as far as possible, and further assumes that none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are functioning.  Based on these assumptions, the worst case scenario vapor cloud explosion could potentially affect nearby public receptors. The process controls mentioned in the previous paragraph minimize the potential for the worst case scenario to occur.\n\nThe facility complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) regulations, including the process safety management (PSM) requirements.  Facility personnel undergo operations competency training and testing, and emergency response training and drills.  The response training and drills program includes notification of the State Emergency Planning Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee, and local fire department. These three agencies also receive SARA Tier II chemical inventory reports annually.   In addition, the facility is inspected and audited on a compl"
