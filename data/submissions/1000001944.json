Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nUS Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing and food distribution operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system \ncomplies with local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes\nand standards where appropriate. In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR 1910.119 and Environmental Protection Agency 40 CFR 68, we maintain compliance with EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM requirements.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of\nmerely responding to problems.  Our RMP and PSM programs includes elements addressing:\n\n(1) Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n\n(2) Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so that our employees are fully informed.\n\n(3) Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n\n(4) Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n\n(5) Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a\ncomprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n\n(6) Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n\n(7) Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n\n(8) Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, we conduct a formal safety rev"
