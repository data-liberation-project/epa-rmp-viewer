      "SummaryText": "EMP Co-op Inc. is an aricultural retailer, which distributes fertilizer products to farmers. Our clients reside in Allen and Paulding counties. Our regulated substance is Anhydrous Ammonia. This product is sold in the spring, early summer and in the fall. This product is stored in an 18,000 gal. Storage tank and is distributed via 1000 gal. nurse tanks. The customer applies the anhydrous ammonia directly into the ground. Our plant has an emergency response plan which contains: 1. Emergency escape procedures and emergency route assignments. 2. Employee procedures for those who operate critical operations before evacuation. 3. Procedure fo accounting for all employees after evacuation. 4. Description for rescue and medical duties for employees. 5. Prefered methods for reporting emergencies to respective agencies. 6. Names and job titles of persons who can be contacted for further information concerning the emergency response plan. Our worst case scenario would be a leak in the storage tank. Our facility has an 18,000 gallon storage tank, which is only filled to 85% of capacity of the tank. This scenario assumes that the tank would be filled and it would leak off in ten minutes. This release would affect the rural area of Harrison Township in Paulding County Ohio. The small town of Payne Ohio would be affected in this scenario. The affected area is a 2.13 mile radius from the storage tank. Our alternative case scenario would be a rupture of a transfer hose from the loadout to the nurse tank. The transfer hose size is 2.0 inches and the release time would be 2 minutes. Wmployess are always present during transfering Anhydrous Ammonia therefore the leak would only last for approximately two minutes, using the DEGADIS model provided by the Fertilizer Institute, this scenario would affect a 1.18 mile radius from the storage tank. We are proud to report that our plant has not had an accident in the past nine years. Through employee training and maintenance of our facility,"
