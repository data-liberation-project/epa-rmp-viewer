Because of this, Shell is dedicated to environmental protection, employee health and safety, regulatory compliance and pollution prevention through a strategy of continual improvement and teamwork.\n\nOur company environmental, health, and safety (EHS) policy and requirements promote the overall safety of this facility, our employees, and the public. This policy includes risk reduction programs that provide assurance for the safe management of process risks to prevent environmental, health and safety incidents and to protect the workplace, the community and the environment. Shell is committed to complying with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of methane. This program enables the facility to prevent the occurrence, or minimize the consequences of, significant releases of methane.\n\nIt is Shell\u0092s policy to conduct our business in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and permits and to promote a safe workplace and a quality environment. Each employee is trained and required to comply strictly with this policy.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe Shell RNG Friesian Biogas Facility located at 3460 South 1600 East, Wendell, Idaho, 83355, conducts a biogas production process that generates methane (74-82-8). The facility is classified as a Prevention Program 3 and is regulated by EPA RMP and OSHA PSM for the flammable substance methane which is held on site in excess of 10,000 lbs.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention\nThe facility\u0092s overall approach and commitmen"

The facility has implemented Program 3 Prevention Programs for the biomethane production process. The prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and/or consequences of any accidental releases from this process. Shell updates the facility prevention programs based on periodic training, process hazard review, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP revisions and updates as required to reflect facility changes.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nThe facility is new in 2025 and has not had a release of a regulated substance that has caused any injuries to employees or impacted any offsite receptors in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAs a non-responding facility, the Shell RNG Friesian Biogas Facility is not required to develop or implement an Emergency Response Plan (ERP). Instead, an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) hass been developed by Rev1 Energy to provide a formal emergency preparedness program that protects human health and property in the event of an emergency such as fire, medical, severe weather event, etc. This plan also formalizes the arrangements with local police, fire departments, hospitals, and emergency response personnel in case of an event. Rev1 reviews a copy of this plan with each employee.\n\nPlanned Changes\nShell continues to review its programs and procedures and make improvements where necessary. At this time, no significant improvement needs have been identified."
