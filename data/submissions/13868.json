      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at Cape Canaveral Air Station (CCAS) for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This Risk Mangement Plan summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to the community of hazardous chemical releases.  The Plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements, including:\n\n-Introduction;\n-CCAS policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n-Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n-Hazard Assessment;\n-Prevention Program;\n-Five-Year Accident History;\n-Emergency Response Plan; and\n-Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nCCAS Health, Environment, and Safety Policies\n\nCape Canaveral Air Station has several response plans that address health, safety, and environmental policies.  Furthermore, the Risk Management Program will help CCAS to prevent and/or reduce the risk of accidents.  These plans detail the specific responsibilities, actions, and procedures that must be undertaken by various organizations during daily work activities in order to protect the health and safety of personnel, the public, and the environment.  Examples of such documents include, but are not limited to:\n\n-Facility Response Plan/Spill Prevention Plans;\n-Disaster Preparedness Plans; and\n-U.S. Air Force Technical Orders for proper equipment operation.\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances Covered Processes\n\nCape Canaveral Air Station is located in Brevard County, Florida.  Hydrogen is stored within Complex 17 (17,700 lbs), Complex 36A (14,900 lbs), Complex 36B (14,900 lbs), and Complex 40 (14,900 lbs).  All these Complexes store Hydrogen above the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Also, Hydrazine and 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine (within a mixture called Aerozine-50) are stored at Complex 40 (89,250 and 85,750 lbs, respectively).\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nEPA's OCA Guidance Refer"

These programs include a processes hazard analysis, training, maintenance, management of change, a pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor safety procedures.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nOn 12 August 1998, a Titan rocket exploded 42 seconds into liftoff.  Since the rocket exploded well after liftoff, there were no injuries, evacuations/sheltered-in-place, or property damage.  However, there was ocean water contamination from the 145,500 lbs of Aerozine-50 released (74,210 lbs of hydrazine and 71290 lbs of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine). \n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12 (b)(3)).\n\nThe Disaster Control Group (DCG) is the primary overseer for any mishaps.  Upon notification, the initial response element (Fire Protection, Medical and Security Police) responds directly to the site.  Training is performed as required.\n\nCCAS has a response plan that addresses the handling of emergencies: Disaster Preparedness Operations Plan 32-1, Vol. II (1 December 1995).  CCAS coordinates emergency response activities as the situation dictates with the office of emergency management (the local LEPC), and the local port and county authorities.  \n\nDepending on the quanity and chemical involved in a \"reportable spill,\" CCAS also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is an integral part of the CCAS daily operations and activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections and documented compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  At this time, no further improvements have been identified."
