Describe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nMeadow Gold Dairies recognizes management's responsability in protecting its employees, equipment, property,\nand the environment. The safety and health of all personnel and the protection of the environment are very important. \nThe control of accidents has and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Company has a Plant Safety Program. The primary objective of the Plant Safety Program is to achieve maximum \nefficiency and safety performance.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in preventing the accidental releases of refrigerant and minimizing the impact of any\nrelease, the facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management and Risk Management program \nto comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly \nHazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.199) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Risk Management \nPrograms for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). Emergency action programs have been reviewed \nas well. The Objectives of the PSM/RMP programs are to prevent accidental releases through use of good operating \nprocedures and mechanical integrity of the refrigeration system. The Plant Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMeadow Gold Dairies operates a milk processing facility where milk products and yogurt are processed, packaged, sold, and distributed from this facility. Ice cream is no longer produced at this facility, but is still distributed from here. An important part of the processing and handling involves a refrigeration system to provide cooling or freezing during processing and storage at the facility. \n\nThe refrigeration system is a closed loop system whereby liquid refrigerant from the high pressure receiver located outside the building is piped in "

      "FacilityID": 37937,
      "SummaryText": "special piping to refrigeration equipment used for cooling or freezing. During cooling or freezing, the pressure of the refrigerant is reduced so that the refrigerant can take away heat from the milk or yogurt being cooled, the ice cream being maintained at a frozen state for distribution, and the coolers and freezers being cooled. The refrigerant returns to the engine room in larger special piping in vapor form at low pressure to the booster or high side compressors where the vapors are compressed and piped to the condensers located outside.Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors in the lines. From the condensers, the refrigerant flows by gravity back to the high pressure receiver, completing the loop. The refrigerant is a non-corrosive chemical; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, lines, or valves. It also carries a small amount of oil from the compressors. All vessels containing refrigerant are ASME pressure rated above the maximum operating pressure.\n\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe program consists of the following elements:\n\na. Employee Participation: Maintenance employees participate in developing the Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs), Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and other elements of the program. \nb. Process Safety Information: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) have been developed where all refrigeration vessels, lines, and valves are numbered on the drawings. All refrigeration valves (except small gauge valves) are numbered.Information has been collected, which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the refrigerant MSDS.\nc. Process Hazard Analysis: Studies are conducted with maintenance personnel using the What-If/Checklist technique to look at the system and identify potentioa hazards.\nd. Operating Procedures: Written procedures have been developed which describe the steps that should "

Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on the system and the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\nf. Contractors: Contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform on or near the refrigeration system.\ng. Pre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review will be completed for all new refrigeration projects involving a change to the system to verify all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, operating procedures developed, P&IDs developed, PHAs completed, and construction has been completed according to design specifications. \nh. Mechanical Integrity: Annual inspections of the refrigeration system including lines and valves by a team of management and hourly personnel. Any recommendations are resolved promptly.\ni. Hot Work Permits: Procedures to be followed to ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting,welding, or burning in any area other than one designed as hot work.\nj. Management of change: The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\nk. Incident Investigation: The procedures are designed to ensure that all incidents involving the refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\nl. Compliance Audits: Audits will be conducted every three years to ascertain whether or not the program is in place and working properly.\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\n1)  On August 30, 1999, a maintenance employee attempted to tighten the seal packing on a refrigerant transfer pump. The packing flange plate broke, allowing the packing to be blown out of the pump and resulted in the release of about 150 pounds of refrigerant to the atmosphere in 15 minutes.Two employees who had contact with refrigerant were washed down and treated by the fire department on site.\n\nE.
