Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.                To insure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Hope Processing Plant, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Hope Processing Plant, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n     Hope Processing Plant is a slaughter and further processing plant.\n \n The regulated substance that the Hope Processing Plant has is Anhydrous Ammonia. The maximum intended inventory is 55,000 lbs.\n  \n3.  Worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenario(s).\n\n Worst-case scenario. - Failure of high pressure receiver when full releasing 12,800 pounds of ammonia in 10 minutes.   The high pressure receiver will be full only when the entire system is being pumped down for repairs.  This situation occurs on the average of 2 to 4 times per year.  Therefore the possibility of a worst-case scenario will exist only 2% of the time.  This facility has never had a failure of a high pressure receiver.  The loss of 12,800 pounds of ammonia will have a distance of two miles before no longer posing a health hazard to the public. \n\n\nAlternative release scenario - An upset condition resulting in an overpressure of the ammonia system causing a safety relief valve to discharge 500 pounds of a"

This facility has had TWO release in the past 5 years of this type.\n\n\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations        Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n    Tyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.  Tyson Foods Inc. uses the IIAR Basic Ammonia Refrigeration Training Series for all operators. \n \n5.  Five-year accident history.\nOn Saturday May 20, 1995, fire broke out in the ice room area of the Hope Processing Plant. The processing plant was not processing and maintenance personnel were the only people on site. The plant and surrounding community was evacuated. A total of 13 fire departments responded to the fire. Ammonia piping in the area was identified and isolated along with the main or king valve at the receiver tanks from the rest of the refrigeration system. Initial system inventory estimates and ammonia release of 1900/lbs. There have been no reported adverse health or environmental impacts as a result of this release.\nOn December 20, 1998, we had a water pipe to rupture and causing liquid ammonia to enter the chill water system. System was isolated with-in 20 minutes. Loss of ammonia was calculated 127/lbs.\n\n6.   The emergency response program.    \nA fully trained and equipped Emergency Response Team is on site.
