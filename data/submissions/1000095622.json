      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is being written for the Parish Utilities of Ascension for the process of Chlorine. Parish Utilities of Ascension uses chlorine to kill harmful bacteria in our drinking water. According to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the addition of chlorine to drinking water for the purpose of disinfection is on of the ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. Chlorination and other treatments of drinking water began in the early 1900's and became widespread public health practices, further decreasing the incidence of waterborne diseases.\n\n\n\nThis is a submission for the Parish Utilities of Ascension. Parish Utilities of Ascension will house a maximum of 6,000lbs of chlorine, which is located at the rear of the facility. This amount is greater than the threshold limit set by EPA.\n\n\n\nParish Utilities of Ascension's Risk Management Plan (RMP) is kept on file in the plant at all times. The guidelines for the RMP are obtained from \"Compliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for Water Treatment Plants.\" This is a book released by The American Water Works Association Research Foundation. The RMP is in \"RMP eSubmit\" format which is a program obtained through the EPA.\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Assessment is conducted to identify the possibility of a release or an accident. Conducting a five-year accident history survey is part of the Hazard Assessment and there were no accidents to report.\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program is conducted to prevent the possibility of a chemical release. All chlorine equipment is inspected and maintained once a year regularly to make sure that all the equipment is working properly. Every inspection and routine maintenance procedure is documented and kept on file with all Risk Management Program information. There is also a procedure followed for receiving and hooking up a chlorine cylinder. Parish Utilities of Ascension has a chlorine system that runs on a vacuum system. This means that in the event of a"

There is a form on file entitled \"Designation of Management Program\". In this form, the chain of authority is defined according to the RMP. There is a specific amount of safety information on file at Parish Utilities of Ascension at all times. The Material Safety Data Sheets for chlorine and all other chemicals are readily available for all employees at all times. Chemical Inventories and safe upper and lower temperatures and pressures are also available at any given time. A hazard review was conducted and is on file with all RMP information. Any hazards identified will be corrected immediately to ensure a safe working climate and community. A compliance audit was conducted and a checklist was put on file for future use. A compliance audit will be conducted every three years or in the event of a major change. Forms for an incident investigation are kept on file in case a situation would arise.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan is written to be certain that employees and certain agencies know what to do in the event of a release or an emergency. Parish Utilities of Ascension is coordinated with Ascension Parish LEPC and local fire departments. LEPC will assist Parish Utilities of Ascension in any way and communicate information to the public concerning a chlorine leak by way of radio transmission or cable over-ride as\n\nneeded. The Louisiana State Police will be contacted in the event of a leak for any assistance they may give. The chlorine distributor and ChemTrec will be called also to offer help in fixing a leaking cylinder if they are needed."
