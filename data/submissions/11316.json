      "SummaryText": "Chlorine gas can be slowed down by closing of the room were the Chlorine is in use,  and we will try to divert as much of the chemical into the system if possible.  This will slow down the amount of leakage into the atmosphere.  Authorized personnel will attempted to shut off or repair chemical using safety equipment and repair kit.  To find a Chlorine leak, tie a rag on a stick,  and dip rag into some 26 degree Baume' Ammonia and hold it near the suspected leak.  White fumes will indicate the exact location of the leak.  NEVER PUT WATER ON A CHLORINE LEAK.  The mixture of water and Chlorine will increase the rate of corrosion of the container adn make the leak larger.  If Chlorine gas from a leaking container can be used in the operating system,  the pressure in the container can be lowered and the leak will be less serious.  If the operating system cannot use it fast enough,  the Chlorine should be passed into an alkaline solution,  which will absorb it.  Such solultions can be made using Caustic Soda  or Soda Ash mixed with water.  The Chlorine should be passed into the Alkaline Solution near the bottom of the container, through and iron pipe or weighted rubber hose.  Either Caustic Soda or Soda Ash, along with suitable containers to hold the solution,  must be kept near the Chlorine unloading areas,  ready for instant use.  \n\nAfter leak is controlled clean up may consist fo the cleaning of all fixures and the replacement of damaged fixtures,  for corrosion control.\n\nThe London Utility Commission's has the Chloine in a enclosed building designed for storage and use of Chlorine.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be for all 6 - 1 ton tanks to leak at the same time.\n\nThe 1 Ton tanks of Chlorine are received from P. B. & S. Chemical Company.\n\nIn the last five years we have not had a  Chloine leak."
