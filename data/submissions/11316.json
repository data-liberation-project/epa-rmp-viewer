              "Description": "Chlorine is a poisonous gas and may be fatal if inhaled, contact may cause burns to skin and eyes.  Irrinant or corrosive,  isolate hazard area and deny entry,  stay upwind and away from low areas,  authorized personnel only with self-contained breathing apparatus and chemical protective clothing near contaminated area.  If chlorine comes in contact with eyes,  immediately flush with large amounts of water for at least 15 minutes,  occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids.  If in contact with skin,  immediately flush with water for 15 minutes.  If clothing is contaminated remove immediately.  If ingested,  immediatly drink large quantities of water.  DO NOT induce vomiting.  If inhaled,  rush to hospital immediately.  IN-PLACE SHELTERING.  The average rate of air change per hour in \"average\" american homes and office-type buildings under average conditions is 0.8 to 1.0 acph with doors and windows closed and ventilation systems closed down.  \"Leaky\" buildings or average buildings exposed to severe weather conditions,  with air change rates of 1.5 to 2.5 acph, may experience 45 to 65 percent of outdoor concentration in 30 minutes.  If a structure is exposed to hazardous concentrations for an extended period of time,  the chemical concentration inside the stucture may approach the outside concentration.  Therefore,  in-place sheltering is generally applicable for releases of short duration (30 min. or less) and may have limited applicaton for releases over a period of time in excess of one hour.  The local radio and television stations will be used to notify residences to stay inside and turn off all air conditioners,  heat pumps,   and all outside ventilation.  The local law enforcement agencies,  local fire departments and rescue department will be ask to assist in notification of residences inside the affected area.  Training of facility personnel,  The facility personnel are trained in the use of the SCBA's,   and have annual retraining in its use.  They have been trained by P. B. & S. Chemical Co. Safety Department  in Chlorine handling and use.  The London Utility Commission does annual retraining on the safety handling of Chlorine.  The  employee's are trained on using 26 degree Baume' Ammonia to detect a leak.  The employees are trained in the use of Caustic Soda and Soda Ash to absorb a Chlorine spill.  Training of Community Response Personnel.  The Ambulance Inc. of Laurel Co.  H.I.T. Unit,  the fire department,  Rescue Squad and Laurel Co. Emergency Management Agency are trained in Disaster Control and are on 24 hour call.  Local fire departments adn many other local emergency response personnel have had the Kentucky Tech (Awareness and Operations Level Training on Hazardous Materials).  The Hazardous Incident Team and Laurel Co. Emergency Management have received the Haz-Mat Techinicans Level Class.",

      "SummaryText": "Chlorine gas can be slowed down by closing of the room were the Chlorine is in use,  and we will try to divert as much of the chemical into the system if possible.  This will slow down the amount of leakage into the atmosphere.  Authorized personnel will attempted to shut off or repair chemical using safety equipment and repair kit.  To find a Chlorine leak, tie a rag on a stick,  and dip rag into some 26 degree Baume' Ammonia and hold it near the suspected leak.  White fumes will indicate the exact location of the leak.  NEVER PUT WATER ON A CHLORINE LEAK.  The mixture of water and Chlorine will increase the rate of corrosion of the container adn make the leak larger.  If Chlorine gas from a leaking container can be used in the operating system,  the pressure in the container can be lowered and the leak will be less serious.  If the operating system cannot use it fast enough,  the Chlorine should be passed into an alkaline solution,  which will absorb it.  Such solultions can be made using Caustic Soda  or Soda Ash mixed with water.  The Chlorine should be passed into the Alkaline Solution near the bottom of the container, through and iron pipe or weighted rubber hose.  Either Caustic Soda or Soda Ash, along with suitable containers to hold the solution,  must be kept near the Chlorine unloading areas,  ready for instant use.  \n\nAfter leak is controlled clean up may consist fo the cleaning of all fixures and the replacement of damaged fixtures,  for corrosion control.\n\nThe London Utility Commission's has the Chloine in a enclosed building designed for storage and use of Chlorine.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be for all 6 - 1 ton tanks to leak at the same time.\n\nThe 1 Ton tanks of Chlorine are received from P. B. & S. Chemical Company.\n\nIn the last five years we have not had a  Chloine leak."
