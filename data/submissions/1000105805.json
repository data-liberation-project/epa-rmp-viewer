Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nAt Don's Cold Storage, we utilize anhydrous ammonia that is considered hazardous by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA). The properties that make ammonia valuable as a\nrefrigerant also necessitate certain safety precautions. Don's strives to protect all its valuable\nresources and assets-both personnel and property.

It is our policy to comply with all\nFederal, State, and Local regulations. Through continual, accurate training and various safety\ndevices and procedures, we work to minimize potential releases.\n\nOur emergency action plan has specific procedures for accidental releases of anhydrous\nammonia as well as other emergencies. We work in conjunction with the Webb City Fire Department\nand the Jasper County Local Emergency Planning Committee to prepare for necessary notification\nof all affected neighbors.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary purpose of our facility is the temporary storage of refrigerated and frozen foods. We\nutilize anhydrous ammonia as the primary means for refrigeration and freezing. An outside company\nis used to fill our main receiver tanks. Piping then carries the ammonia to the needed refrigeration or\nfreezing units.
