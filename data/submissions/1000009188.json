The Chlorinator StationA?s \"Scale Room\" utilizes 8 cylinders in-service at a time, and 4 cylinders are stocked in the same room in preparation for empty cylinder exchanges.  The remaining cylinders are stored in the adjacent bulk storage area, where cylinders are stored until they are transported off-site to remote chlorinator station facilities.  All stock cylinders are provided with safety bonnets that protect fragile valve components on the cylinders from damage during transit and when the cylinders are not in-service.  The bonnets are only removed immediately prior to placing a cylinder in-service.\n\nThe storage area and Scale Room are maintained at a temperature of around 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  An emergency eyewash, shower, and emergency equipment kit are provided at the facility.  The facility is equipped with a chlorine gas monitor that is connected to an alarm that would notify City personnel in the occurrence of a chlorine release.  Blueprints of the facility, MSDS sheets, and a first-aid kit are also provided on-site at the facility. \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency responsibilities have been instituted at the facility which include, but are not limited to, the following programs and procedures:  standard operating and maintenance procedures, training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine, notification of trained personnel, and emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the occurrence that local emergency response is required.  \n\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention program that is in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems, and alarms.\n\nNo reportable accidents have occurred in the last 5 ye"

Procedures are in place to identify and record any future accidents or incidents.\n\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program has been developed to include an evacuation plan, assembly areas, and other safety information.  This program has been coordinated with the City of BaltimoreA?s Emergency Response Program - Sara Title III off-site response plan.  The off-site plan will supersede the on-site response program in the event that an accidental release extends beyond the facilityA?s boundary.\n\nThe City will update the program as required and will review the program every five (5) years or when applicable on-site conditions require updates to the program."
