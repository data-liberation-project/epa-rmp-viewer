Each employee is granted the authority to stop work if it is deemed unsafe. The job will not be continued until the work methods are evaluated and changed, if necessary, to make the work area safe. Management continues to do all it can to protect the Health and Safety of all staff and to provide a safe working environment. However, safety requires the participation of everyone...only you can\nmake safety a reality. Be alert for conditions which appear unsafe. Report unsafe conditions immediately, Report any accident, \"near miss\", exposure, incident, spill or release.\n1.2. A Description of the Surprise, AZ. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n1.2.1. Description of the Surprise, AZ. Facility\nThe Surprise, AZ. facility is located at 13255 West Sweetwater Ave., Surprise, AZ. The facility provides transportation and warehousing services for manufacturers, distributors and end\nusers of pre-packaged specialty chemicals. Warehousing activities include shipping, receiving and storage of chemicals as specified by customer requirements. The chemicals stored at the Surprise, AZ. warehouse include chemicals containing toxic and flammable hazards. Ammonia (anhydrous), chlorine, dichlrosilane, fluorine, hydrogen and hydrochloric acid ?37% are the RMP regulated substances stored and handled in the warehouse/gas pad. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride and ammonium hydroxide 29% are stored in ISO tanks and/or tube trailers/MEGCs in the facility's ISO yard and are a separate storage process from the warehouse/gas pad.  \n1.2.2. Description of the Warehousing and Storage Processes\nRinchem receives various size containers of aqueous chemicals and cylinders of specialty gases by truck as shipped from the manufacturer or distributor. ISO tanks and tube trailers/MEGCs are delivered by the manufacturer or distributor by tractor on chassis. Cylinders a"

      "SummaryText": "re unloaded from the truck using a forklift or dollies and staged for inspection. ISO tanks are typically offloaded from the chassis with an ISO loader for storage.  Tube trailers/MEGCs typically remain on the chassis and placed into appropriate storage locations.  After the storage vessels, ISO tanks, and tube trailers/MEGCs pass quality and safety inspection, they are placed into the hazard-specific storage area until they are shipped to the end user. The storage location of each vessel is tracked in an electronic inventory management system. When an order is received, the storage vessels are picked and staged for quality and safety inspection. After the order passes inspection, it is loaded on to a truck for shipment using a forklift or dolly to the end user. Orders for ISO tanks and tube trailers/MEGCs follow the same basic principle. For ISO tanks in storage, once the order is placed and the load inspected, it is picked with the ISO loader and secured to the chassis of the delivery vehicle.  For tube trailers/MEGCs, the transporter inspects the load and chassis before hooking up to the chassis.  \n1.3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \nRinchem management realizes that implementation of appropriate administrative and technological safeguards ensure the safety of the workers and the continued safety of public receptors. Those recommendations that are planned for implementation will be discussed in \"Planned Changes to Improve Safety\". The safeguards include both administrative and technological safeguards that prevent, detect, or mitigate releases of anhydrous ammonia, ammonia in souution (ammonium hydroxide 29%), chlorine, dichlorosilane, fluorine, hydrogen, hydrochloric acid  ?37% and anhydrous hydrogen chloride.\n1.4.

      "SummaryText": "Program\nOverall safety at the Rinchem Company, LLC, Surprise, AZ warehouse is governed not only by our ability to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, ammonia in solution (ammonium hydroxide 29%), chlorine, dichlorosilane, fluorine, hydrogen, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, and hydrochloric acid  ?37% from occurring, but also by the ability to mitigate any accidental releases of the abovementioned materials. Rinchem has developed an emergency action program to minimize the effects of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, ammonia in solution (ammonium hydroxide 29%), chlorine, dichlorosilane, fluorine, hydrogen, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, and hydrochloric acid  ?37%  to employees. Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by using contracted services for emergency response and spill cleanup. The Surprise warehouse Emergency Action Program consists of a Business Continuity Plan and facility-specific Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters and other emergencies that may arise. The Emergency action plan and documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure of the plan. \nNotification Exercises:\nIn response to the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68.96(a), Rinchem has developed procedures to conduct an exercise of the stationary source's emergency response notification mechanisms.  As all Rinchem Company, LLC facilities are non-responding stationary sources, Rinchem management and EHS recognize the importance of communication to emergency response organizations that hazards that are present at Rinchem facilities.  Rinchem has, and will continue to send community outreach letters to emergency response organizations (LEPC, Fire and Police) and invite these organizations to tour our stationary sources and participate in  accidental"
