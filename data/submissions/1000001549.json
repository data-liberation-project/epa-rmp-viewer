This commitment is an inherent part of our compehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such releases do occur we will notify the Brownfield Fire Department, which provides emergency response.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in 4-10,000 gallon tanks and 3-12,000 gallon tanks.  The maximum amount stored is 354,928 at the maximum fill capacity of 85%.\n\n3.  Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized The Fertilizer Institute, DEGADIS model for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  THe following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the largest anhydrous ammonia storage tank of 56,078 pounds (12,000 gallons) over a 10 minute period.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .79 miles. \n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The scenario involves the release of 26,638 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 2 minutes. The distance to the endpoint is .59 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydours Ammonia of the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  We are also guided by the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administrat"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nOur record of prevention accidental releases over the last 5 years is excellent.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release has occured during this period\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency action plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  THe plan addresses all aspects of emergency response including first aid and medical treatment, evacustions, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public."
