Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Ecopax, Inc are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is \n\ndemonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, \n\ninstallation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  \n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass producing foam boxes.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our \n\nfacility.  This substance is Butane.  Butane is used as a blowing agent for plastic products.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-\n\nSpecific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out \n\nunder 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 \n\nStandard, 2002 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program \n\nthat is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nEcopax, Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating \n\nparameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and \n\ncontrolled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by \n\na team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular \n\ninterval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed"
