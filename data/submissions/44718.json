At the sounding of the alarm, the compressors automatically shut down.  An ammonia dump fire access panel is mounted on the exterior wall of each mechanical room.  The fire hose is affixed to the panel and the ammonia charge can be dumped and mixed with water upon discharge.  Formal inspections using the ANSI standard are conducted annually.  Lines and vessels are routinely inspected for corrosion and damaged insulation.  Gauges are calibrated routinely.  Personnel are trained to operate the systems safely.",

Chocolate, nuts and other ingredients are accepted at the plant and used in the preparation of specialty candies.\n\nThe facility maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems, which sustain a milk and nut cooler, a -10 degree F freezer unit, plant process water coolers and facility air conditioners.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration systems in excess of the 112 r threshold.  Ammonia is the only 112 r chemical used at the facility.  \n\nThe plant is located east of Interstate 45 and south of State Highway 287 at 1997 Pecan Delight Avenue.  The plant consists of a production building and a small wastewater treatment building southwest of the main structure.  The production building is a brick fronted, single story, metal frame structure approximately 468,000 feet in size.  The building houses production, offices, and the Candy Store.  The wastewater treatmetn system building is a small metal structure housing the equipment for the activated sludge system including the sludge filterpress and disposal container.\n\nThe facility began production in April 1999, and operates today with two production shifts two maintenance shifts.  Facility operations include receiving and storage of raw materials, measurement of the various ingredients into specific batch quantities, blending of ingredients prior to hand finishing of the chocolates, packaging and warehousing of product prior to shipment.  \n\nOn the south side of the main building is a concrete secondary containment dike where the 12,000-gallon backup fuel tank is located.  Also within the dike are a 300-gallon diesel fuel tank and, typically, several drums of used oil. \n\nThe grounds are open with access to employee parking and the Candy Store along the north side from Pecan Delight Avenue.

The North System serves the milk and nut cooler as well as the air-cooling Niagara systems and process water-cooling.  It contains approximately 27,799 pounds of ammonia.  The South System serves the freezer and contains approximately 4300 pounds of ammonia.  For purposes of the Risk Management Plan, the larger of the two systems was used to conduct the off-site consequence analyses.  \n\nBoth refrigeration systems are visually inspected each shift by the operators.  Each system is provided with emergency pressure relief valves piped to diffusers on the roof of the building.  The mechanical rooms where the receivers are located are equipped with ammonia sensors, which initiate  visual and audible alarms throughout the plant.  The sensors are set to warn at a perceived concentration of 30 ppm ammonia, and the visual and audible alarms are triggered at 50 ppm ammonia.  In addition to the sensors, there are either equipment electric panel lights or computer monitoring readings for temperature, pressure, and/or liquid level on all pressurized elements of the systems. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario was calculated based on the loss of the contents of the largest system in accordance with the definition provided by the Environmental Protection Agency guidance for RMP development.  As required by the guidance for toxic worst-case scenario, the contents of the ammonia refrigeration process is assumed to be released instantaneously as a gas.  Only passive control systems capable of withstanding a release event were taken into consideration for the analysis.  Determination of the area of potential impact was made using RMP*Comp.\n\nFor modeling purposes it was assumed that the largest of the two ammonia receiving tanks fails and releases 27,799 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.

Release time and weather conditions are dictated by the EPA guidance.  The ammonia gas is considered to pose no further risk to the public when it has dissipated to a concentration of less than the toxic endpoint specified in the RMP rule (1.4 mg/L).  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated to be 1.5 miles from the plant.  The population potentially affected totaled an estimated 4,320.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario is by definition, a more likely release scenario than that considered for the worst case.  Engineered controls, such as chemical detection systems, and alarms, are included in the analysis.  As with the worst-case release scenario, modeling was performed using RMP*Comp.  \n\nThe type of failure identified for the alternative release was the loss of ammonia due to a failure of the flexible hosing used to fill the ammonia receiver tank.  The tank is filled from a tank truck via a fifty-foot metal reinforced pressure hose.  The hose is affixed to the truck and extends through the nearest building doorway to the mechanical room where the tank is located.  Should there be a rupture of the hose, excess flow valves on the t4ruck and the receiver tank would cut off the flow of ammonia.  Only the amount of ammonia in the hose would be released.  The hose would release approximately 0.6 pounds of ammonia.  The distance to the toxic endpoint from such a release was estimated at 0.1 miles.  No off-site receptors would be affected. \n\nA process hazard analysis was performed on the systems beginning with the loading and receiver tanks and ending with the ammonia return to the receiver tanks after having cycled through the refrigeration systems.  A HAZOP type of analysis was used.  General questions regarding the storage and use areas as well as practices and protocols associated with the management"
