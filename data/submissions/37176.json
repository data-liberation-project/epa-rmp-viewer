      "SummaryText": "The City of Gillette Environmental Services Wastewater Division (WWTF) accidental release prevention program involves a unified approach that uses available technology and management policies to meet the requirements.  The Gillette WWTF emergency policy involves the preparation of response plans tailored to each facility and to the emergency response available within the community.  All applicable procedures of the EPA RMP are adhered to.\n\nThe clorine unit at the Gillette WWTF is a facility used to disinfect the outgoing effluent from the treatment process.  This unit includes a chlorination room, which may contain four 1 ton choroine containers and a repair kit.  The unit also contains a feed room, housing the chlorinator, injection equipment, flow recorders and alarm systems.  Two SCBA's are located in the ajacent building.  Wastewater operators check the unit and it's alarm systems daily and respond to any trouble alarms which may occur.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as worst case release and alternative release.  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the Owner/operator shall assume that the\u00bf maximum quantity in the largest vessel\u00bf is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative release is defined as a more likely to occur than the worst case.  The worst case scenario at the Gillette WWTF involves a failure of the one ton container.  The offsite consequence analysis is for the condition of a release of the entire amount as a gas in ten minutes, the first set of conditions pre defined by EPA.  The EPA RMP OFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS GUIDANCE for CHLORINE was used for the modeling.\n\nAt the Gillette WWTF there would be offsite consequences involving a gas release that could effect an estimated population of 7000 within a 2 mile radius.  The chlorine unit is located at the east end of the treatment process.  Leak reduction, mi"

      "SummaryText": "tigation and control devices that are in place are, operating procedures, chloring gas leak detectors, and enclosed rooms for the ton containers as well as alarms in both the feed room and the container room.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the flexible connections (pigtail) or a lead washer leak.  The same systems are in place for both passive and active mitigation, allowing us to respond to minor leaks in an efficent and timely manner.\n\nThe Gillette WWTF accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n  High level of training of the operators\n  Preventive maintenance program\n  High quality process and safety equipment\n  Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n  Hazards reviews of equipment and procedures\n  Auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) worn by the operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, and the awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine.\n\nNo accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program, which has been coordinated with the Campbell County LEPC/Fire Department.  The Operators have on going training in the use on SCBA's first aid and CPR, as well as equipment failure drills or related items quarterly."
