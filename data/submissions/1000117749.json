Process 2 is equipped with a plate heat exchanger and liquid recirculator as required for a pumped overfeed operation.\n\nProcess 1 and 3 control valve groups are located on the roof to provide easy access. The refrigeration machinery is contained within or directly above each machinery room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\nP1 North Machinery Room\n(3) Screw compressors\n(3) Oil separators\n(1) Shell and tube oil cooler\n(2) plate oil coolers \n(2) Liquid recirculators\n(4) Ammonia pumps\n(1) Auto purger\n(1) Thermosyphon vessel\n\nCondenser Area\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n(1) High pressure receiver\n(1) Liquid transfer vessel\n(1) Diffusion tank\n\nRoom 1\n(8) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling suspended)\n\nRoom 2\n(8) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling suspended)\n\nRoom 3\n(8) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling suspended)\n\nLoading Dock\n(4) Air-cooling evaporators (ceiling suspended)\n\nP2 South Machinery Room\n(3) Screw"

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into each evaporator. Low temperature liquid circulates through each evaporator. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\nThe Wonderful Citrus D1 facility was originally built in the 1998 by California Controlled Atmosphere and has been added to since that time. Most recently the following projects have occurred:\n\n2012/2013 - American Inc. renovated the computer control system for Process 1 and 2.\n2012 - American"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\nWonderful Citrus has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration processes at the Wonderful Citrus facility are an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia processes contains a total charge of approximately 39,000 (LBS). It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\nWonderful Citrus has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\nWonderful Citrus' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\n- Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38 \n- California \"Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response\" (HAZWOPER)"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWonderful Citrus has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Wonderful Citrus continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Wonderful Citrus' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Wonderful Citrus' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nWonderful Citrus has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Wonderful Citrus has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\nFor the future, Wonderful Citrus now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document"
