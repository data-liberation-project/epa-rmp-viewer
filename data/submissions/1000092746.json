Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nIt is XCL Midstream's policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations. The Bryan Condensate Facility has established a commitment to worker and public safety as well as the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility. It is XCL Midstream's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, regular personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. Also, XCL Midstream has coordinated response activities with the Marshall County EMA and local Fire and Rescue Departments.\n\n\n\nB. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Bryan Condensate Facility is a condensate stabilizer facility located in rural Marshall County, West Virginia, near Proctor, West Virginia. The products handled are flammable mixtures that meet the criteria for the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA) 4 rating and are handled in quantities that exceed EPA's threshold of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nC. The Worst-Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\n\na. Worst Case Scenario:\n\nSince the Bryan Condensate Facility does not have any toxic regulated substances above the threshold quantity, the worst-case scenario was only carried out for the uncontrolled release of the largest inventory of flammable mixtures, which was more than 10,000 pounds of a mixture of flammable substances that meet criteria for the NFPA-4 rating. To carry out this analysis, it was assumed that none of the protective barriers in the facility worked. EPA assumes the worst-case scenario to be a vapor cloud explo"

For the Bryan Condensate Facility, it was assumed that the single pressure vessel with the largest amount of flammable mixture (NGL Storage Tank V-410) had a catastrophic failure resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. RMP*Comp, an EPA-sponsored software tool, was used to calculate the distances to 1 psi of overpressure endpoint. As described in the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, the worst-case scenario was carried out based on a release of propane, a component of the mixture in the tank. Meteorological conditions for the worst-case scenario are defined in 40 CFR ?68.22(b) as atmospheric stability class F (stable atmosphere) and wind speed of 1.5 m/s (3.4 mi/h). The scenario involved a catastrophic release of the total quantity of the flammable substance assumed to form a vapor cloud, which detonates. Ten percent (10%) of the material in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion, 13,252 lbs.\n\n\n\nb. Alternative Case scenarios:\n\nAn alternative case scenario considered a release from the NGL Storage Tank V-410 resulting in a vapor cloud fire. Ethane was selected as the predominant regulated component of the mixture, as it resulted in a greater distance to the lower flammable limit (LFL) endpoint. RMP*Comp, was used to predict a distance of 0.1 miles to the LFL endpoint, with a wind speed of 3 m/s and a stability class D with ambient air temperature (77?F). The scenario involved a release of 4,290 lbs/min which continues until the NGL Storage Tank is empty.\n\n\n\nD. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements, which are set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. The Bryan Condensate Facility is a PSM- covered facility and, as such, it has a viable process safety program. Workers and the"

Complete and accurate information on the process technology, process equipment, and hazardous characteristics and physical properties of all chemicals and intermediates for all covered processes is maintained.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information - The Bryan Condensate Facility maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the hazards of regulated substances, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Much of this information was compiled during the preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Chemical- specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's).\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - The facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The HAZOP method is used to perform these evaluations. The studies were undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at regular intervals of no more than 5 years. All findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, the Bryan Condensate Facility maintains written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the process safety. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.

Initial training on gas plant operations is provided, and refresher training will be conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed. Employee training is documented, and records of training will be maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporates training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures. Documented maintenance checks are carried out on process equipment to ensure proper installation and operation. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations at the site. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.
