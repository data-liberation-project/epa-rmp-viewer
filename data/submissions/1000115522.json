The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 1.30 miles from the chlorination facility, assuming a wind speed of 3.4 miles/hour and an atmospheric stability rating of Class F. The potential population affected by the worst-case scenario was estimated to be 8,500 persons.\n\nThe alternate release scenario involves an accidental pipe leak releasing 1,500 pounds of chlorine gas within ten minutes. The distance to the endpoint was estimated to be 0.20 miles from the chlorination facility, assuming a wind speed of 6.7 miles/hour and an atmospheric rating of Class D. The endpoint determination includes the enclosure of the container within the storage room. The potential population affected by the alternate release scenario was estimated to be 200 persons.\n\nActuation of the Chlorine Gas Detectors is considered to be an active mitigation measure. Additionally, the chlorine gas piping is vacuum tubing connected directly to the chlorine containers. A loss of vacuum in the tubing immediately stops chlorine gas flow from the containers and virtually eliminates the possibility of a chlorine release due to a piping leak. The Salem Water Treatment Plant is equipped with a Chlorine Gas Scrubber, which is also considered to be an active mitigation measure.\n\nThe Salem Water Treatment Plant RMP has the key elements listed below. These elements are aimed at preventing a chlorine release from the chlorination system.\n\n-\tHigh level of operator training and maintenance training;\n-\tAn established preventative maintenance program;\n-\tImplementation of an audit and inspection program;\n-\tUse of effective written operating procedures;\n-\tImplementation of an employee participation program;\n-\tUse of emergency air supply and container leak kits;\n-\tUse of a chlorine gas scrubber;\n-\tPerformanc"

      "SummaryText": "The City of Salem, Virginia, is committed to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) requirements under 40 CFR Part 68 and recognizes the responsibility to prevent harm to employees and the public due to a chlorine release. Salem's accidental release prevention program integrates management practices, safety procedures, employee participation, process safety and operating information, process hazard analysis and compliance auditing, pre-startup reviews, mechanical integrity, management of change procedures, incident investigation, emergency planning and response and updating practices and procedures. Applicable requirements for Program 3 Risk Management Programs are adhered to. The emergency response program is tailored to the available emergency responders and the City of Salem Local Emergency Planning Coordinator (LEPC). It includes notification procedures and plant evacuation procedures.\n\nThe chlorination system for the Salem Water Treatment Plant is used to disinfect drinking water. This water is supplied to the residents and businesses in or near the city. The chlorination facilities include a Chlorine Storage Room for one-ton containers, the necessary container handling equipment, and a Chlorine Feed Room with ten chlorinators and various safety equipment and controls. Chlorine is supplied from four one-ton containers connected to the process feed piping. The container in service is controlled automatically using an automatic switchover device that limits operation to a single container at a time. Plant operators check the operation of the chlorination system at least once every hour during each shift and respond immediately to trouble or warning alarms.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis considers two chlorine release scenarios identified as the worst-case and alternate release scenarios. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) RMP COMP model was used to obtain the predictive release information to identify the distance to the endpoint for a potential chlorine re"
