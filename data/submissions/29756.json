There is no permanent storage at this location so full railcars are delivered to the site and then shipped to customers as needed. Occasionally  a contractor comes to the site and connects Anhydrous Ammonia and Phosphoric Acid cars to their batching unit to blend a non-hazardous fertilizer with the analysis 10-34-0. Procedures and training for this process is the responsibility of the contractor, as Simplot Employees are not involved with any Ammonia handling.",

Simplot Company\n302 East Danenberg Drive\nEl Centro,  CA      92244\n\nPhone: 760) 352-8931\n\n1.  Policies and Guidelines\n\nIt is the policy of the J.R. Simplot Company (Policy Statement EN 01.1) to manufacture, handle, store and dispose of all substances safely and in compliance with the requirements of federal, state and local environmental laws while reducing the risks to human health, safety and the environment. Each manager is expected to responsibly implement this policy, and each employee is expected to comply fully with the spirit, as well as the letter of this policy. The Company will assure that the environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, and standards applicable to its products and operations are known and obeyed by employees.\n\nIt is the policy of the AgriBusiness Group of the J.R. Simplot Company (AgriBusiness Policy Statement \"Emergency Response\") that the processing, manufacturing, storage, shipping, or disposal of products and materials shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of public safety and the environment, and in full conformity with the requirements of the law. Each location shall maintain an appropriate level of emergency response capability sufficient to fulfill all legal responsibilities and assure proper response actions in the event of emergency situations involving our own products or facilities.  This includes immediate and prompt notification to regulatory agencies and emergency response authorities as required by the situation and environmental laws and regulations.\n\nThe J.R. Simplot Company Guideline (Guideline Statement SA 01.2) states that the Company is committed to reducing incidents or occurrences in the workplace that result in human injury, illness, or death, and/or destruction or loss to the corporation's assets an"

It is, therefore, our intent to provide a safe work environment and to protect the corporation's assets. This guideline applies to all groups and separate operating entities of the J.R. Simplot Company. Emergency plans shall be developed for each operating unit outlining the practices and procedures for emergency medical care, fire response, evacuation, or other emergencies. Each group shall develop and implement appropriate programs for initial and ongoing safety and loss prevention training of employees.\n\n2.  Regulated Substance(s)\n\nThe substance(s) that are intermittently stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by rail car then the cars shipped to customers, or occasionally mixed with phosphoric acid then distributed to area customers as a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer (10-34-0). \n\nMaximum Quantity Stored in the largest stationary source at this site is 145,00 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in a  33,600 gallon rail car tank. The maximum quantity handled would be a rail car loaded with 145,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car tank, released as a gas over a 10 minute period. The maximum quantity released would be 145,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest stationary storage tank at the facility at 85 percent capacity, as limited by design standards. \n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose, which is estimated to release 11,908 pounds.    \n\n4.  Accidental Release Program\n         \nThis facility has no permanent Anhydrous Ammonia storage, but will follow the appropriate portions of the following rules when an Anhy"

Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site. This is a new process for this location.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194. Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
