      "SummaryText": "The City of Las Cruces owns and operates the Jacob A. Hands Wastewater treatment Facility (JHWWTF) through the Department of Water Resources.  This facility has a design capacity of 13.5 million gallons/day. During the treatment process, chlorine gas is used to disinfect treated wastewater to protect human health, and is followed by sulfur dioxide gas to dechlorinate the treated wastewater before it is discharged to the Rio Grande. Treatment with sulfur dioxide removes residual chlorine in the last step, so the treated wastewater will not harm aquatic organisms or wildlife in the river.\n\n\n\nThe gases, liquified under pressure, are delivered to the JHWWTF in 1 ton containers to a single receiving and storage facility specifically designed for these operations.   The facility is equipped with area gas detectors and alarms.  The amount of gas used in both processes is enough to require multiple 1 ton conatiners.  Three containers are connected to separate, state-of-art vacuum regulator-manifold assemblies for each process.  Because these are toxic gases, special features for safety and reliability have been built into the design of these systems.  The regulators are attached directly to the valve on each container. When in service, the vacuum applied to the regulator pulls a spring mechanism that opens the valve on the container.  If something fails or leaks, the reduction or loss of vacuum enables the spring to close the valve automatically.  Thus, the system fails to a safe condition.  The hazard prevention policy of the Department is to combine state-of-art engineering controls that are reliable, practical, and cost-effective with pro-active, diligent management to operate and maintain both systems at the highest level of safety and performance.  Operators are certified, and trained on site and through a statewide program of continuing education.  Both systems were upgraded in 1995 from their original design to remain current with technological advances.  The mainten"

      "SummaryText": "ance system is fully integrated within the computerized operations system for JHWWTF. Further, the JHWWTF has been in compliance with the requirements of OSHA;s Process Safety Management.  \n\n\n\nThe Department's incident/emergency response policy is to set well-defined limits on operator exposure and responsibility with direct linkage to our Local Community Emergency Response Team.  When a situation exceeds Level 1 criteria, professional emergency/haz-mat responders are notified immediately to deal with the potentially dangerous situation.  The response of JHWWTF staff is limited to those situations that may occur during normal operations, and for which they are trained and sufficiently experienced, i.e. minor leaks that may occur during the connection or replacement of containers.  Operators wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and a Repair Kit B stands by during these operations.  Any incident that exceeds minor leak during routine connecting or disconnecting of regulators to containers (Level 1) is immediately referred to the Las Cruces Fire and Emergency Services (911) and triggers the Local Community Emergency Response through the NM State Police.  Fire Department units from Station 3 can arrive within 5 minutes, and would be followed immediately by units of the Fire Department's Haz-Mat Response Team from Station 4. In such an incident (2 and 3), JHWWTF staff would notify contact persons at neighboring facilities, and then evacuate the site until the situation has been stabilized and authority has been returned to the JHWWTF Manager.   \n\n\n\nPrudent precautions are taken during operations, and are undertaken only when sufficient supporting staff are present.  Connection and replacement of containers is done only during the day shift. JHWWTF staff conduct training and periodic meetings with the Haz-Mat Response Team to ensure that the entire emergency response is as seamless as possible.  Limited emergency response exercises have been done in the past.  Inspec"

      "SummaryText": "tion continue at the facility by City Risk Managment and Facility personnel. To date we have had no incidents involving chlorine or sulfur dioxide. \n\nReview and updates to the facility and the RMP identified by staff and EPA Region 6 inspection of April 15, 2017 have been implemented. Of significance was the correction of an editorial error between the RMP and Tier II documentation that now correctly indicate that there are up to 6 Tons of both Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide contained in 1 Ton cylinders that may be stored at the facility at any time. Updates to contact personnel and emergency notification team were also revised at that time and have been kept current since.  Updated signage and emergency evacuation and response routes have been updated for staff and responders.  On September 12, 2018, updates were completed to both the water and wastewater facilities Emergency Response Plans by CH2MHill (now Jacobs) and incorporated appropriate RMP components. During the 2017 EPA inspection the utility was notified by the EPA that as a publicly owned and operated wastewater facility, our existing Program Level 3 identification should be a Program Level 2. The 5-year revision and final certification of August 2019 will include the correct facility change from Program Level 3 to a Program Level 2 facility.  \n\n\n\n"
