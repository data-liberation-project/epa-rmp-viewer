The facility also has an established Emergency Response Brigade that routinely undergoes advanced training needed to facilitate a quick response to an emergency and minimize the impact of the event to personnel, to the process, and to the environment. The EPC is reviewed and updated, as appropriate, based on changes at the facility or new information obtained from coordination activities, emergency response exercises, incident investigations, or other available information, and ensures that affected employees are informed of the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency control program for the Geismar Ethylene Plant is coordinated with the Ascension Parish and Iberville Parish Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings which are also attended by local emergency state officials, local government officials, local emergency response agencies, and representatives from other industrial facilities. The Geismar Ethylene Plant has communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., sheriff's office, Geismar Area Mutual Aid, complex emergency brigade, etc.) via radio and telephone. This communication system provides a means for quick notification and, if needed, coordination of mutual aid response as well as notification to the public.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Geismar Ethylene Plant conducts periodic emergency drills on various scenarios to ensure a timely and effective response in the event of an actual emergency.\n\n(F)\t Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant routinely reviews the safety programs in place at the site and implements any identified changes that will improve the overall safety program and enhance protection of all personnel onsite and in the community.  Currently, there are no planned changes outside of these routine reviews. \n\nSubmitted June 11, 2024"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety and environmental consequences in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials. However, if a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n(B)\t Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident \n prevention Provisions. The facility produces ethylene, propylene, crude butadiene and debutanized aromatic concentrate (DAC) from ethane and propane feedstocks. The following regulated chemicals identified in 40 CFR 68.130 are present in quantities above the respective threshold: \n-\tFeedstocks: Ethane, Propane\n-\tProducts: 1,3-Butadiene, Propylene, Ethylene \n-\tTreatment: Chlorine \n\n(C)\t General Accidental Release/Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs Steps\n\nThe Geismar Ethylene Plant has a robust prevention program which is aligned with the elements from EPA\u0092s Risk Management Program (RMP) and OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.
