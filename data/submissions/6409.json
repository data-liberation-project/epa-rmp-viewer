Products is committed to safety and the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances to the environment.  The use of Chlorine in the manufacturing of Phosgene is operated and maintained in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented release prevention programs and emergency response policies in order to preserve and protect the health of employees.  These programs and policies also serve as protection of human health and the environment of the communities surrounding J.H. Products.  \n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOur Lockport facility uses chlorine (Cl2) to manufacture phosgene (COCl2), thus requiring regulation under the RMP Rule.  Cl2 is purchased in 55-ton railroad cars and is combined with carbon monoxide (CO) in the process to make COCl2.  The COCl2 produced is stored in 1-ton DOT-51 cylinders.  Some Cl2 is also transferred directly to 1,600-lb DOT-51 cylinders.  COCl2 and Cl2 are the only toxic chemicals regulated under the RMP Rule by Part 68 that J.H. Products has on-site as part of a process.  J.H. Products has no flammable substances regulated by Part 68.\n\nC. Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nIt is a requirement of the RMP to model releases of our toxic substances as part of a hazard assessment.  This hazard assessment must include one (1) worst-case release scenario and one (1) alternative release scenario for each substance involved in a process covered by the RMP Rule, regardless of the likeliness of the release.  \n\nThe following brief summaries of each of these scenarios give the results of the modeling done using the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, and further give passive and active mitigation techniques that are in place to limit the feasibility of such a release to occur.\n\nAs mentioned above, J.H. Products has two (2) toxic substances covered by the RMP Rule: COCl2 and Cl2 \n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - COCl2\n\nThe wors"

The liquefied phosgene, at its vapor pressure and ambient temperature is assumed to immediately evaporate and be released to the atmosphere as a toxic gas.  Passive mitigation is considered because the release would take place indoors.  Therefore, we multiply the release rate by 0.55 to account for the enclosure.  The scenario assumes rural conditions, F stability and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  The toxic endpoint of 0.00081mg COCl2 per liter of air reached a radius of 15.0 miles.  Public receptors affected by this release are residences, several schools, two hospitals, the county jail, public parks, and numerous area businesses.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario -Cl2\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a release of chlorine is a complete failure of the 55-ton railroad car, thus releasing approximately 110,000 pounds of Cl2.  The chlorine liquid is assumed to instantaneously evaporate and be released as a toxic gas.  The release rate to the atmosphere was calculated to be 11,000 pounds per minute with no mitigation measures in place to limit the release.  Assuming rural conditions, F stability data and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, the impacted radius from the site to chlorine's toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L is greater than 25 miles. The public receptors located within this release radius include the majority of the City of Lockport and its surroundings including numerous residences, schools, hospitals, public parks and recreation areas, the county jail, businesses and major industrial sites.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - COCl2\n\nThe alternate case or more-likely scenario for a release of phosgene is valve failure on the cylinder that would allow a maximum possible release of 2,000 pounds in 1 hour.  The properties of phosgene are the same as above, however the plug valve on the cylinder can only release the entire content"

The public receptors located within this release radius include numerous residences, hospitals, schools, the county jail, pubic parks and recreation areas, businesses and major industrial sites.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Cl2\n\nThe alternate case or more-likely scenario for a release of chlorine is a valve failure on the storage cylinder being filled directly from the railcar that would allow a maximum possible release of 1,600 pounds in 1 hour.  The properties of chlorine are the same as above, however the plug valve on the cylinder can only release the entire contents of the cylinder in an hour as a maximum release rate.

These steps greatly reduce risk:\n\nInspections - Regular inspections are performed on all process equipment to assure that the probability of failure is minimal.  Through constant maintenance and careful monitoring of all operations and equipment, J.H. Products can prevent potential harm to employees and the surrounding environment by discovering an accident before it happens.\n\nPersonnel - J.H. Products maintains high standards for its employees in their ability to monitor and operate the onsite processes.  Extensive training and experience in plant operations makes our employees our most important asset in maintaining safety onsite and preventing accidents.\n\nTechnology - J.H. Products uses advanced technology in its processes to automate and control precise process conditions.  Further, this technology also monitors deviations in these process conditions that include leaks or that could produce a leak.  Any deviations that could potentially result in a release are immediately corrected if possible or otherwise shutdown.  We also have a monitoring system that detects a release of either COCl2 or Cl2 in the process area, and sounds an alarm to alert employees.\n\nEmergency Response - It is a vital part of Risk Management to minimize the effect that any release of a regulated substance could have on human health and the environment.  We maintain an extensive response program for accidents onsite that pose a potential harm to employees and to offsite public receptors, including local residences.  Our program keys in on stopping the release, getting the right people to the scene quickly, and notifying offsite public rece"

Our facility is committed to its programs that minimize the potential for any accidents and releases of a hazardous substance.  We strive to improve safety onsite at all times and operate at or above our own high standards for safety.\n\nE. Five-year Accident History\n\nWe are required by the RMP Rule to report all accidental chemical releases of regulated substances that meet or exceed the reportable quantity and keep them on-file as part of this Risk Management Plan.  Further, we are required to keep on-file all accidental chemical releases that have occurred in the last 5 years.\n\nAs a result of J.H. Products' programs on safety and accidental release prevention, we have had no reportable releases in the past 5 years, as of June 20, 1994 involving substances covered under Part 68.\n\nIf such a release should ever occur, following the implementation of emergency response program procedures, a formal investigation will be conducted to identify and correct the cause(s) of the incident.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency situation, J.H. Products maintains a written emergency response plan to respond in an orderly, efficient and safe manner.  Our emergency response plan provides key background, planning and training for the handling of and responding to releases of regulated substances.  The plan also defines procedures for proper notification of off-site public receptors in an emergency situation.  Procedures for notification of local authorities with which our plan is coordinated are also given in the plan.
