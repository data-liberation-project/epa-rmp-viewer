The primary product group at the plant is a family of chemicals known as organometallics.  The primary use of these chemicals is as a catalyst in the plastics and other industries.  Some of the organometallics are also used on-site in the production of other specialty organic chemicals, including industrial intermediates, agricultural chemicals, and curatives.  Albemarle also handles many of the utility services for the complex, including steam production, potable water, thermal transfer fluids, and compressed air.  Ketjen LLC Pasadena shares its site with partner companies.\n\nPer \u00a768.130, there are six chemicals regulated under the EPA Risk Management Program that are present above the threshold quantity at the Albemarle Pasadena site.  Listed toxic chemicals are chlo"

Anhydrous hydrogen chloride, ethylene, and hydrogen are used on the plant site from pipeline supplies, though these chemicals are not stored or present on site above the threshold quantities.\n\nChlorine is used onsite for water treatment purposes and has a maximum storage capacity of 8,000-lb.  \n\nMethyl chloride, ethyl chloride, 1-butene, and 2-methylpropene, are each used as reactants in the production of different organometallics.  When methyl chloride is used and stored onsite, the capacity is under 200,000-lb.  When ethyl chloride is used and stored onsite, the maximum storage capacity is 275,000-lb.  Typical ethyl chloride inventory is about half that due to mixing with another chemical.  Maximum storage capacity of 1-butene is 1,200,000-lb, although typical inventory is much less.  Storage capacity for 2-methylpropene is 200,000-lb.\nIsopentane is used as a carrier solvent in one of the organometallic production units, and also as a blending solvent when packaging other organometallic products for shipment.  Total plant inventory of isopentane can be up to 400,000-lb, though the maximum storage capacity in any one area is 200,000-lb.\n\nRegardless of regulatory listing or quantity,  Ketjen LLC Pasadena manages all site processes and equipment as if they were covered by the OSHA PSM or EPA RMP standards.  Our release prevention plan and contingency planning programs are tools that we use to manage the potential hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nKetjen LLC Pasadena Site has always believed in taking a structured, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.

The site also aligns its process safety systems with the Risk-Based Process Safety program as promoted by the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS).  The site has a dedicated process safety manager and is staffed with qualified, safety-trained engineering leadership.  Operations and maintenance personnel are also trained and qualified for their job tasks.  Employees are empowered and encouraged to identify anything out of the ordinary and take corrective action. \n \nAll processes (especially those covered by the RMP and PSM standards) are routinely evaluated in a formal process hazard analysis and reactive hazards evaluation, which is at the heart of the release prevention program.  Process safety information for all the processes is well-understood and readily available.  Information from these feeds into the engineering and administrative controls strategy for each production unit.\n\nProcesses are operated and controlled with a computer-based distributive control system that is programmed to alert operators of abnormal conditions and take corrective action when safety limits are threatened.  Independent safety instrumented systems are also implemented for certain process units with higher hazard potential.\n\nSafety and reliability are incorporated into the design and construction of the process equipment, following industry standard practices such as those from the American Petroleum Institute, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, International Society of Automation, National Fire Protection Association, and the Chlorine Institute.  Ketjen has also developed a number of internal engineering standards that meet or exceed these standards, especially for materials in which  Ketjen has extensive experience and expertise, like organometallics. \n\nThe Ketjen LLC Pasadena site has implemented an aggressive mechanical integrity and inspection program to identify and correct potential problems before they occur.
