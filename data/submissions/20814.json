Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management \n        personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n        The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 280,000 pounds,  this \n        location has rail tank car accessability.\n\n3)     The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n       The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released\n       as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which \n       represents the volume of the largest storage tank as limited by design standards.\n\n       The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the worst case scenario is 1.2 miles.\n\n       The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break\n       in a transfer hose.\n\n       The distance to the endpoint of .14mg/L for the alternative scenario is  .56 miles.  This release has the \n       possiblity of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\n4)    The accidental release prevention program.\n\n       This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes\n       an"
