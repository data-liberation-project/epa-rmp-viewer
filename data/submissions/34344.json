Key concepts of this program\n\ninclude  periodic Process Hazard Analyses (PHA),  up-to-date\n\noperations   and   maintenance  procedures   and   training,\n\nManagement  of  Change  and  Pre-Startup  Review  processes,\n\nperiodic compliance audits and incident investigations,  and\n\nemployee participation in site safety processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1  Process Hazard Analyses\n\n\n\nA multi-departmental team of Engelhard employees recently\n\nconducted an ammonia system Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) in\n\nJune 2004 using current Process Safety Information.  The PHA\n\nwas designed to proactively identify and address any system\n\nweaknesses in order to prevent accidental ammonia releases.\n\nItems identified were documented and appropriate work orders\n\nsubmitted.  Procedures are in place to maintain this PHA\n\nconsistent with the current ammonia process and to update\n\nand revalidate it at least every five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2  Procedures and Training\n\n\n\nIt  is  Engelhard's policy to ensure that its employees  are\n\nprovided clear instructions for safely conducting all  work-\n\nrelated activities.  Accordingly, the ammonia system  has  a\n\nset of related standard operating procedures (SOPs) and safe\n\nwork  practices.   Employees operating  the  ammonia  system\n\nreceive  various forms of training in these  SOPs  and  safe\n\nwork  practices  to  ensure that they  have  the  knowledge,\n\nskills, and abilities to safely carry out their duties.\n\n\n\nIt is also Engelhard's policy to inspect, test, and maintain\n\nits process equipment in a manner consistent with applicable\n\nmanufacturer's    recommendations   and   recognized    good\n\nengineering practices.  Accordingly, Engelhard has  ammonia-\n\nrelated   maintenance  procedures  addressing   preventative\n\nmaintenance  and repairs, hot work permits, etc designed  to\n\nprevent  accidental ammonia releases.

To ensure that these changes are managed\n\nand  implemented safely, Engelhard has Management of  Change\n\nand  Pre-Startup Review processes in place  to  ensure  that\n\nsafety and health considerations and procedural and training\n\nrequirements  are addressed in conjunction with  any  change\n\nbeing implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4  Compliance Audits and Incident Investigations\n\n\n\nEngelhard  conducts routine audits of its  ammonia  accident\n\nprevention program to ensure the program's effectiveness and\n\ncontinuous improvement.  However, should an ammonia  release\n\noccur,  Engelhard  has  an  Incident  Investigation  process\n\ndesigned  to  quickly identify root causes  and  appropriate\n\nactions  to  prevent future releases.  These  investigations\n\nare reviewed regularly for trends, etc as a means of further\n\nmanaging the safety of Engelhard's manufacturing processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5  Employee Participation\n\n\n\nEngelhard's ultimate goal is to achieve an injury-free\n\nworkplace.  An ongoing objective in support of this goal is\n\nto include all employees in all facets of safety.\n\nParticipation in site safety efforts is therefore expected\n\nand rewarded.  Employees participate in various safety\n\nprocesses such as Workplace Inspections, Behavioral Safety\n\nObservations, Job Safety Analyses, Root Cause Analyses,\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n4    Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nEngelhard has had no releases of ammonia that have  affected\n\nonsite personnel, the public, or the environment in the past\n\nfive years.\n\n\n\n\n\n5    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nEngelhard does not have onsite emergency response capability\n\nto  respo"
