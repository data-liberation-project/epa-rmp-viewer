Seq.  The regulations are also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  Pacific-Ultrapower prepared the RMP to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling system and practices at the facility.  Pacific-Ultrapower has incorporated many safety features into the ammonia systems at the facility as part of original system design. Pacific-Ultrapower will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP.  Pacific-Ultrapower Chinese Station revised this document in June 2004 to satisfy regulatory requirements requiring re-validation and re-submittal every five years (five-year update) and to incorporate recent regulatory changes effective April 2004.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific-Ultrapower facility is located approximately 6 miles south of Jamestown and 1.5 miles east of the junction of State Highway 108 and State Highway 120.  The area surrounding the facility is primarily open range land with a few private residences and a small industrial park.  The Pacific-Ultrapower Chinese Station facility was constructed in 1985 and is operated by Constellation Operating Services.  The Pacific-Ultrapower facility is a wood and biomass fueled power plant that produces electricity.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used at the facility to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) produced when the wood and biomass is burned in the power plant.  Ammonia is stored in a 12,000-gallon tank as a liquid under pressure.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and is injected into the boiler combustor.\r\n\r\nThe"

      "SummaryText": "RMP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the facility.  Pacific-Ultrapower has incorporated many safety features in the ammonia system to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases.  The predominant safety concern with pressurized systems is inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to ammonia expansion.  The Pacific-Ultrapower ammonia system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down components if deviations from normal operating conditions occur.  Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels and all locations within the systems where ammonia could become trapped.  The pressure relief valves are replaced every five years. \r\n\r\n\r\nOther safety features at the facility include: \r\n\u00bf\temergency shutdown systems\r\n\u00bf\tpressure relief valves on vessels and line segments that contain, or could contain, liquid ammonia \r\n\u00bf\tcomponent specific safety shutdowns that are independent of the central computer control system\r\n\u00bf\toperating alarms \r\n\u00bf\tsystem is inspected by facility operators at least every shift\r\n\u00bf\tphysical barriers around the storage tank and vaporizer\r\n\u00bf\tcaps on all lines\r\n\u00bf\tthe ability to double block and bleed some of the line segments in the systems\r\n\r\nIn addition to the physical features of the ammonia system at the facility, Pacific-Ultrapower has extensive administrative controls in place to maintain safe operation of the system.  Administrative controls include, but are not limited to: formal training programs for system operators and mechanics, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, confined space entry program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program and an RMP auditing and inspection program.

A computerized preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the system.  Preventive maintenance at the facility includes shift, daily, weekly, annual and periodic inspection, calibration, testing and overhaul of the equipment.  The computerized system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nThe RMP regulations require a review of the five-year accident history at the regulated facility.  Pacific-Ultrapower reported no accidental releases of ammonia during the past five years.  \r\n\r\nIn the unlikely event that an ammonia release requiring emergency response occurs at the facility, Pacific-Ultrapower trained all operators and mechanics for emergency response.  The facility has a written emergency action plan that identifies the roles, responsibilities and actions of personnel during an emergency.  Pacific-Ultrapower will rely on local community responders to assist in mitigating ammonia releases at the facility.  Pacific-Ultrapower will also rely on community responders for medical assistance and public evacuation or protection in place, if necessary.\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety at the facility are ongoing.  The mitigation measures suggested by the process hazard analysis team have been implemented.  The status of significant mitigation measures is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tSOPs have been prepared.
