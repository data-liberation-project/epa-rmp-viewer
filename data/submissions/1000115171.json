Facility Policy:  The management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia.  Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  \n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient. \n\n3.  Accidental Release Program:  This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association\u0092s (CGA\u0092s) \u0093American National Standard Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\u0094 (6th edition), commonly referred to as \u0093ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014\u0094, as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". Compliance with these regulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention program.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Program:  This facility is a non-responding facility.  This facility has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA Standards 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120.  The Emergency Plan for this facility includes specific instructions for employees regarding the response procedures to an emergency.  Response pro"
