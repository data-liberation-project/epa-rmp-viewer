Acrolein is loaded via a hose into a maximum of twenty pressurized field tanks containing up to 399 gallons (2,797 lbs.) of acrolein each.  During unloading, the ISO tank remains under motive transport; potential spills from the ISO tank have not been considered per EPA RMP requirements.  During and after field tank filling, the transfer hose line is purged of acrolein using nitrogen, and the purge gas is vented through a gas scrubber control system into the atmosphere. The acrolein is inhibited by adding hydroquinone to slow oxygen catalyzed polymerization. Additionally, the head space at the top of the cylinder is filled with pure nitrogen.  The maximum expected inventory of acrolein at the Multi-Chem facility is 56,000 pounds (twenty 2,797 lb acrolein tanks).  There are no acrolein chemical processes involved at the Multi-Chem facility as no product is used at the facility.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nThe HAZOP method will be employed by Multi-Chem personnel to systematically identify, analyze and correct potential hazards associated with the storage, handling and movement of acrolein at the facility.     After completion of the initial process hazard analysis, the HAZOP will be reviewed and the finalized. The process hazard analysis findings worksheets will be used to document the findings, recommendations, corrective actions and completion dates.
