Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Crowne Cold Storage has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Crowne Cold Storage, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Crowne Cold Storage has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name           | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration    Anhydrous Ammonia           17,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses, and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures, and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Description\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage operates a commercial packing and storage facility for blue berries in Stockton, CA. The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system which provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n(8) Post-cool Rooms\n\n(1) Staging Area\n\n(1) Loading Dock\n\n(2) Refrigerated Domes\n\n\n\nThe Refrigerated Domes are equipped with evaporators and accumulators as required for flooded operation while Post-cool Rooms, Staging Area, and Loading Dock are equipped with evaporators and a pump recirculator as required for pumped overfeed operation. The refrigeration machinery is contained within the Machinery Room and outside the Post-cool Room. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n(1) High Pressure Receiver\n\n(1) Main Suction Accumulator\n\n(1) Liquid Transfer Vessel\n\n(1) Liquid Recirculator; equipped with an Oil Pot and (2) Ammonia Pumps\n\n(2) FES Screw Compressors\n\n(1) Imeco Evaporative Condenser\n\n(19) Ceiling Suspended Evaporators\n\n\n\nThe Refrigerated Domes operate as follows: high pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to each dome, where it passes through an expansion valve into low temperature and pressure accumulator. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which is returned to the accumulators. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulators through a suction return line to a main suction accumulator. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a wa"

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each evaporator, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculators. The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage was purchased from Calamco in 2014. California Controlled Atmsophere was hired in 2015 to supply and install new refrigeration equipment for a new Machinery Room. In addition, California Controlled Atmosphere disconnected the tunnel piping from Calamco's system and moved two (2) screw compressors to the Machinery Room.\n\nThe refrigeration system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent ammonia gas to a diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. Each entrance to a machinery room contains emergency refrigeration shutdown and ventilation controls for use during an emergency situation.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at Crowne Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are "

As such, Crowne Cold Storage has one (1) refrigeration process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Crowne Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business. The process is only operational approximately 3 months out of the year. The remainder of the year, ammonia is stored in vessels. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n\n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- Cal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- U.S. Occupation"

Nevertheless, Crowne Cold Storage continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Crowne Cold Storage's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Crowne Cold Storage's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nCrowne Cold Storage has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.

A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Crowne Cold Storage has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Crowne Cold Storage now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\". It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Crowne Cold Storage employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement. Through the RMP-PSM program Crowne Cold Storage will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety."
