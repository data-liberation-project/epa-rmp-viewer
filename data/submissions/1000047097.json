If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.                                                                                           \n\n\n\nAirgas manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.

The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous materials unit so that the approriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental releases.                                                                                              \n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no planned changes to improve process safety, however if Airgas identifies technologies or procedures that might improve safety, they will evaluate the feasibility of such a change and implement if appropr"
