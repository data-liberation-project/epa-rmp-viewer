If an emergency to occurs it is our policy to  notify the Monona Fire Department and request they respond to the emergency.\nA description of the facility and the regulated substance handled.\nThe Monona Propane plant is a storage tank providing back-up  fuel for the Grain Dryers during natural gas cold weather curtailment. \nThe worst-case release scenario.\nOur worst case scenario is failure of the storage tank when filled to the amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to end-point is .4 miles. There would be private homes within the distance to end-point, with a total population of 14 people.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention program steps. \nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\nFive year accident history. \nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused death, injuries, property  or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \nThe emergency reponse program.\nIn event of the an emergency involving our propane storage, it is our policy to notify the Monona Fire Department and the Clayton County LEPC and request they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with the fire department and  members of the fire department have inspected our propane system.\nPlanned changes to improve safety. None."
