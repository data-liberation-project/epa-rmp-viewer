      "SummaryText": "I have been asked to comment on what type of facilities and people that we have here at Chaffee-Lynchburg Farmers Elevator.  In 1992, the Agronomy Department manager, Mark Dooley, along with the rest of the employees of Chaffee-Lynchburg Farmers Elevator, were named the North Dakota Outstanding Pesticide Dealer of the Year.  In 1993, the business received the Environmental Respect Award from DuPont for taking steps to improve the environment.  This award allowed Clark Holzwarth and Mark Dooley to attend a conference in Washington D.C. in order to lobby for the continued use of fertilizers and chemicals.  We have also been working with the North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Division on their risk management program.  We have received some very good benefits from this program because we have had only one week of down time on one person since we started this program.  Another program that we have put in is the North Dakota Grain Dealer's Safety and Health Emergency Action plan and Hazard Communication Standard.  With this program, we can keep the training and right to know laws in effect for the people who work for Chaffee-Lynchburg Farmers Elevator.  We are keeping our facilities and equipment in as good of working order as we can so that our employees have a good working environment.  Submitted By:  Clark Holzwarth, General Manager."
