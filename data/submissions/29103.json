              "Description": "Designing For Safety\n- The Department of Transportation (DOT) approved carriers are made of heavy gauge steel with reinforced bases.  This design gives them a low center of gravity and makes them hard to tip over.\n- Dome cover lids protect the valve connections on the top of the carrier.  Connections are blanked during transport.\n- The carriers have lead liners for corrosion prevention.\n- There is no bottom drain valve on the carriers; bromine liquid is discharged by pressure through a well line in the top of the carrier.\n- There is protected access to the bromine feed lines, making a break by impact improbable.\n- A dedicated warehouse area has been specified and clearly marked to protect the carriers from flammable substances.  Protective railings minimize the possibility of an accidental impact by a forklift.\nOperating Safely\n- A pressure relief valve is installed on the carrier when it is in the production area.  If a fire occurred, the carrier could not pressurize to dangerous levels.\n- Bromine carriers within the building are not transported on pallets.  The carriers are equipped with slotted attachments so that a special fork truck can pick them up without tipping them over.\n- Bromine leaks are easily detected visually and by smell.  Since operating procedures require continual operator attendance during charging periods, reaction time to leaks is minimized.  At all other times, procedures require pressure on the carrier to be relieved and the valves closed to isolate the carrier from the process.\n- Procedures require two operators to be present to ensure correct valve positioning/sequencing any time a carrier is connected to or disconnected from process piping. \n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the bromine process are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n- Flex hose connectors to the process are replaced every six months, regardless of condition.\n- The supplier visually inspects the lead lining and corrects deficiencies before filling the carrier with bromine.\n- Every five years the carrier is physically opened to measure the lining thickness and is cleaned and water-tested to 1.5 times the design pressure.\n- The bromine system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\nAuditing Our Operations\n- Bromine carriers undergo a safety inspection on a routine annual schedule.  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use.\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

Also, the total inventory in the tank is controlled so there is always room to hold the entire contents of a railcar. \n- The storage tank is located in a dike that can hold the contents of the tank should a leak develop. \n- The tank, unloading station and distribution pumps are protected by a fixed fire protection system that is automatically activated by heat from a fire, by signals from an automatic leak detection system, or manually if necessary. \n- The tank is equipped with a pressure relief valve to prevent overpressurization of the tank. \n- The tank is equipped with pressure indicators/alarms and temperature indicators/alarms.\n- The unloading system consists of closed loop piping to minimize releases to the atmosphere.\nOperating Safely\n- The railcar is visually inspected before it is unloaded.\n- Personnel verify that the storage tank can hold the entire contents of the railcar before the transfer is started.\n- Operating procedures require continual operator attendance during acetaldehyde transfers to the storage tank so reaction time to leaks is minimized.  \n- The operation of the storage tank system is continuously monitored using a distributed control computer system.  \n- Operators mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the process are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations.\n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n- The acetaldehyde system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.  \n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\n- The area leak detector system is routinely checked by Certified Instrument Analysts. \n- The fire protection system is inspected, tested, and maintained per NFPA 25.\nAuditing Our Operations\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

The cylinder valves are recessed to prevent the valves from being damaged.  \n- The HF cylinders are not equipped with thermal or pressure relief devices.\n- The HF cylinder is contained in an enclosed concrete cubicle.  There is protected access to the HF cylinder, making a break in the cylinder improbable.\n- The HF cylinder cubicle is equipped with emergency shutdown systems which will mitigate releases.\n- HF detectors at the HF cylinder cubicle and in the production facilities provide notification of leaks in these locations and activate water systems designed to prevent HF vapors from traveling out of the immediate area.\n- Piping used for transferring HF to the process is a special thick walled corrosion resistant material.\nOperating Safely\n- A fire inside the HF cylinder cubicle is very improbable because no flammable material is stored in the area; therefore, overpressurization of a cylinder to dangerous levels is highly unlikely.\n- Only one full cylinder and one partially full cylinder of HF is allowed on-site.  There is no other on-site or off-site inventorying of HF.  The HF cylinder is delivered by the vendor directly to the HF cubicle.\n- Leaks are easily detected visually and by smell.    \n- The HF transfer supply line between the HF cubicle and the production facilities is purged clear between additions of HF.  The HF addition step is a small component of the batch cycle.   \n- The HF addition is DCS controlled. \n- The HF addition is a low pressure addition which is well below the design criteria of the piping system.\n- Procedures require two operators to be present when connecting or disconnecting an HF cylinder.\n- DSC interlocks and ESD systems (both software and hardwired) are in place to ensure the safe handling and addition of HF and to safely terminate an HF addition should a release occur.\n- Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel who work within the HF system are trained and qualified in accordance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. \n- Any changes to operating procedures or equipment are reviewed for potential impact on health, safety, and the environment using the Management of Change Process.\nMaintaining Safe Operations\n- Flex hose connectors to the process are routinely inspected to be in good condition as part of the operating procedure. \n- The HF cylinder/process piping connection and the HF reactor system are routinely pressure checked for leaks to ensure the integrity of the system. \n- HF detection systems are routinely calibrated.\n- The HF system is inspected on a routine basis to ensure the mechanical integrity of the piping, instrumentation, interlocks, and ESDs (as applicable).  Any discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use or in a safe and timely manner when necessary means are taken to assure safe operation.\n- Operators are initially trained on the process.  Refresher training is completed at least once every three years.\nAuditing Our Operations\n- HF cylinders undergo a safety inspection by the vendor on a routine schedule.  Discrepancies or defects are corrected before further use.\n- Audits are completed at least once every three years in accordance with PSM/RMP requirements.",

Refresher training is completed periodically, but at least once every three years.\n\nIn addition to the above elements, the Eastman Kingsport Site is a State of Tennessee Volunteer Star site.  The Volunteer Star program, administered by the State of Tennessee Department of Labor, is Tennessee's version of the federal Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), a cooperative effort between employers and OSHA to improve worker safety and recognize outstanding safety performance and programs.  Fewer than 400 sites nationwide have qualified for Star status.\n\n\n\n\nV. Five Year Accident History\n\nIn the five years previous to the submission of this report, the Tennessee Eastman Division has had only one RMP reportable incident. In 1998, the Tennessee Eastman Division experienced a release of 200 gallons of anhydrous ammonia to the air and to the Holston River, which had an adverse affect on some aquatic life.  There was no impact on either plant personnel or the community.\n\n\nVI. Emergency Response  Program\n\nGeneral Emergency Response Practices for All Chemicals:\n\n1. Eastman emergency response personnel use a computerized modeling system to predict the concentration and location of any vapor cloud resulting from a hazardous vapor release.  The system is able to provide real-time monitoring of the weather to enhance protection of anyone who may be impacted in the plant and in the community.\n2. Response is coordinated with emergency response agencies in the community via a Field Command Post and a Control Center.\n3. Eastman's emergency response crews use a multi-tiered emergenc"

For vapor releases that might impact the community, a direct line to city and county central dispatch services is available.  Sirens are activated and local radio and TV stations are notified.\n4. Emergency response personnel are regularly trained to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements.\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nImprovement plans fall into three primary areas:\n\n1. Hazard Analysis-Continual identification of potential hazards and prompt implementation of corrective action will be done in accordance with applicable regulations and as a matter of company policy.\n\n2. Incident Investigation-Prompt, thorough investigation of all significant incidents and near-misses will be conducted using root cause failure analysis (RCFA) techniques, and learnings will be shared across the company.\n\n3. Benchmarking-Through our trade association, the Chemical Manufacturers Association, and through other cooperative efforts, such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety, we will continually evaluate our safety programs and processes against the best in the world, with the goal of continual improvement."
