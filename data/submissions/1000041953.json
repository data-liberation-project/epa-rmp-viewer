      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\r\nMonte Vista Cooperative Center Fertilizer Plant stores liquid anhydrous ammonia which is considered a regulated toxic substance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The anhydrous ammonia is primarily used as a raw material to produce Ammonium Polyphosphate fertilizer.  The Center Fertilizer Plant also sells anhydrous ammonia for fertilizer application and industrial refrigeration.  \r\nThe properties that make anhydrous ammonia a valuable fertilizer and refrigeration source also makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during handling and storage.  It is the policy of the Cooperative and its employees to adhere to all of the Federal and state rules and regulations, so as to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to the community.  Safety depends upon the competent training of Cooperative personnel, the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia and the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.\r\n\r\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled: (this section will be omitted from the Executive Summary in RMP*eSubmit)\r\nThe only regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount stored at the site is 185,153 pounds.\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck (transports) and is stored in one (1) storage tank and is distributed from this facility by nurse tank.  The facility has the necessary equipment to safely load and unload transports and nurse tanks.  Access to the tank controls and hoses are restricted to authorized employees and management personnel, along with authorized contractors that may work on the facility.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios: (the language below will be replaced with the following for the Executive Summary in RMP*eSubmit:  This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requ"

      "SummaryText": "ested by EPA.)\r\nThe likely-hood of the loss of the total contents of the largest storage tank is extremely remote due to administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the amount of anhydrous ammonia released.  However, if the largest storage tank were to totally fail when filled, there would be a release of 16,800 gallons or 139,914 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  Company policy limits the maximum filling of all tanks to 85% of the capacity at 60 degrees F.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released as a vapor.  The distance to the end point of the toxic cloud for the worst case scenario release of 140,000 pounds in a ten minute time period would be 1.16 miles in the urban topography.  This would extend beyond the facility boundary, encompassing public receptors.\r\nThe alternative scenario would be a pull-away while filling a nurse tank which would result in the release of contents of a two (2) inch diameter hose.  As in the worst case scenario this has not occurred at this facility and if it were to happen the facility has excess flow valves and emergency shutoff valves in place to actively mitigate the release.  Again, if this event were to happen and the excess flow valves and/or emergency shutoff valves stopped the flow, the contents of the hose would be released.  The end point for the toxic cloud in a urban topography is 0.56 miles.  This distance would extend beyond the facility boundary and encompass public receptors.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention program:\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule, with OSHA's requirements and with other applicable Federal and state codes, standards and regulations.  The facility design and construction are in accordance with the ANSI/CGA G-2.1 and the OSHA 1910.111 standards.

A permit is required when hot work is to be conducted on or near the process.

Recommendations resulting from the audit are addressed and efficiencies documented and corrected.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC):\r\nThe Cooperative's MOC system was developed to ensure that changes at the plant will not result in undetected unsafe situations and employees will be aware of all changes and their implications.  The MOC system includes the following considerations before any process changes take place:\r\n\u00bf\tAuthorization requirement for the change\r\n\u00bf\tTechnical basis for the proposed change\r\n\u00bf\tImpact of the change on health and safety\r\nAfter changes are made, all affected employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the affected employees prior to startup of the modified process.
