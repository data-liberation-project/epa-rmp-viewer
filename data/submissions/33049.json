      "SummaryText": "LAKE SALTONSTALL FACILITY\n\nThe Lake Saltonstall Water Treatment Plant (Lake Saltonstall) has two independent chlorine injection systems that are fed through a one ton container.  There is only one ton container of chlorine on line at any given time.  The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is a vacuum regulator to automatically switch from one chlorine cylinder to the other when the pressure drops and the gas container is empty.  Each one ton container is equipped with a spring loaded normally closed valve attached to the container head.  If the system loses vacuum (due to a down stream malfunction, leak, etc.), the valve shuts and chlorine addition is automatically stopped.  The valve is a normally closed, static control device that requires no electrical power to operate.\n\nThe facility has three chlorine detectors to monitor leakage in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms.  One detector in the chlorine storage room gives a digital readout of the atmospheric chlorine concentration.  The sensor is located in the storage room, but the readout is located outside this area. Chlorine sensors are located at six inches above floor level in both rooms.  The detector will alarm at the main control room panel and automatically start the dry scrubber in the affected area.  Currently the facility has two building exhaust fans to vent the chlorine gas from the building and to provide a minor level of worker safety.   A chlorine release inside the building will be drawn into the scrubber and neutralized using a solid adsorbent.  The scrubber has the capacity to adsorb one full ton container of chlorine gas (2000 pounds of chlorine).\n\nThe Lake Saltonstall Facility normally stores a maximum of eight one ton containers at the site at any one time.  All containers are stored indoors in a building with doors, which seal.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area.  The building doors are open and the chlorine contai"

All chlorine containers are stored within the chlorine storage room.  If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound and the dry scrubber starts-up automatically.  Air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn into the building.  The scrubber will provide a negative pressure within the building and not allow the chlorine gas to leak outside\n\nA second safety feature in operation at this facility is vacuum regulator units.  These units are installed on the operating and standby containers.  If the valve loses vacuum because of a down stream leak on the vacuum side of the valve, the system will lose vacuum and automatically shut down.\n\nThe facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process in the last five years)."
