We have not experienced a major refrigerant loss in over seven years of operation.\n\nWe utilize state operational safety analysis on a voluntary basis to help us correct areas we might be overlooking.\n\nWe coordinate with the state of Texas Emergency Response Commission regarding T.R.I. reporting.\n\nWe utilize IIAR material for posting equipment areas.\n\nThe facility is located in an industrial area, and prevailing winds would distribute a release toward very low population areas.  Personnel have long experience and protective equipment to aid in securing a release event.\n\nAll pressure vessels have safety pressure reliefs, and power equipment has safety over-pressure switches.\n\nWe try to operate so the risk of a major event is minimized, and the response is effective and timely."
