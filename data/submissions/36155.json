A Risk Management Plan (RMP) is in effect at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  This document is a RMP update to verify the facts set forth in the orginal RMP and to advise the 45th Space wing if they are not correct and compliant with 40 CFR 68.\n\nCCAFS policies to protect the environment, health and safety of people\n\nCCAFS has numerous plans in place for the protection of the environment such as the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.  CCAFS also has emergency response plans in place for the protection and safety of people.  CCAFS emergency response plans have recently been changed and updated concerning the protection of the health and safety of the people working at CCAFS and the populous surrounding CCAFS.  Moreover, the RMP assists in the protection of the CCAFS community and the surrounding population.  These plans give specific and detailed directions of the actions to be taken by different organizations to protect the health and safety of CCAFS personnel, the public, and the environment. There are several response plans in place at CCAFS and Kennedy Space Center.  The following are examples of such documents:\n\n32-1 45th Space Wing Disaster Preparedness Operations Plan;\n32-3"

      "SummaryText": "45th Space Wing hazardous Materials Response Plan;\nCape Canaveral Emergency Management Plan (CCEMP) \n\n\nLockheed Martin Astronautics (LMA) is the prime contractor for the Process 3 operation at CCAFS.  Under LMA's contract with the Air Force, LMA's contractural requirements are that LMA follow the directives in the 32-1 45th Space Wing Disaster Preparednes Operations Plan.  Therefore, there is one consolodated emergency response plan to be implemented by LMA in the event of an emergency.\n\nFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes\n\nCCAFS is located near the city of Cape Canaveral, Florida in Brevard County.  Hydrazine and 1,1-Dimethythydrazide (within a mixture called Aerozine-50) are stored at CCAFS in Complex 40.  Hydrazine and 1,1-Dimethythydrazide are stored above the threshhold limit of 10,000 lbs (89,250 and 85,750 lbs, respectively).  CCAFS stores hydrogen above the threshold limit also; however, it is exempt from the RMP requirements of such due to the Fuels Relief Act.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Process 3 at CCAFS, a mixture of hydrazine and 1,1-dimethythyrazide is mandated by federal regulations to have a prevention program.  The Process 3 prevention program includes a Process Hazardous Analysis (PHA), training, maintenance, management of change, a pre-start review, compliance audits, incident investigations, employee participation, hot work permits, and contractor safety procedures.  There numerous regulatory mandates pertaining to the Prevention Program that must be adhered to in order for the RMP to be adequately up-to-date and compliant with 40 CFR 68 regulatory requirements.  The following are regulatory requirements of the Prevention Program Program that CCAFS personnel review before each launch:\n\nMajor Hazards Identified\nProcess Controls in Use\nMitigation Systems in Use\nMonitoring/Detection Systems in Use\nReview of Operating Procedures\nContinuous Training\nProper Maintenance\nManagement of Change\nPre-Startup Review\n\nAdditionally,"

      "SummaryText": "Compliance Audits and Process Hazardous Analysis are performed on a regular basis.\n\nPlanned Updates\n\nThe Titan launches will occur into 2005.  Updates on all RMP requirements will be performed before each launch.\n\nFive-year accident history\n\nThere has been no reportable accident within the last five years of this update.\n\nCCAFS coordinates emergency response activities as the situation dictates with the Office of Emergency Management (the local LEPC), and the local port and county authorities as required by 40 CFR 68.12 (b)(3)).\n\nCCAFS also notifies certain local, state, and federal emergency planning and response agencies depending upon whether there is a reportable spill.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCCAFS is now and has always been cognizant of the importance of safety and emergency preparedness.  Therefore, an ongoing and continuous effort to minimize exposure risks to CCAFS and the surrounding population is incorporated into the daily activities at CCAFS.  CCAFS provides ongoing inspections and documented compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  CCAFS has no new safety improvements planned at this time."
