      "SummaryText": "The Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals - Nashville, NC Terminal is a butane rail car storage facility consisting of up to thirty (30) rail cars.  \n\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe primary function of the facility is butane rail car storage.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals, L.P. - Nashville, NC rail car storage is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Nashville, NC Rail Car Storage Terminal adheres to all applicable federal, state, and local laws/codes.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility's policy to notify the Nashville Fire Department as well as the Nash County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), as necessary.  Medical emergencies will require notification of the Nash General Hospital.  This facility does not maintain a trained fire brigade or hazardous material response team on-site to respond to the small initial stages of an emergency.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances handled at the Facility:\n\nThe Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals Nashville, NC LPG Tank Car Storage Terminal is a tank car storage facility (specifically, rail car).  This Risk Management Program (RMP) covers the butane storage systems only, including the associated thirty (30) detached 33,500 gallon storage rail cars on 1825ft of leased rail.  The maximum amount of butane that can be stored at this facility is appr"

      "SummaryText": "oximately 4,960,500 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility complies with DOT 122J340W, 40CFR Part 68 of the EPA, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  \n\nThis facility's worst-case scenario is the failure of one (1) of the tank car storage system's 33,5000-gallon storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).  The facility's alternate (feasible scenario affecting off-site receptors) release scenario is a VCE incident involving one (1) rail car with vandalism at hatch releasing butane vapors to atmosphere, finding an ignition source and resulting in a VCE.\n\n\n\nFive year accident history:\n\nTo date, this facility has never had an accident involving butane, which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property, environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in-place.\n\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals- Nashville, NC LPG Tank Car Storage Terminal's butane storage system, it is the policy of the facility to initially contact the Nashville Fire Department and request their assistance. The facility currently has no trained fire brigade or hazardous materials response team.  The facility emergency response plans are coordinated with the fire departments and the Nash County LEPCs.  SPM&T is a company that is committed to safety.  \n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility has completed a hazard analysis for this storage facility.  Improvement actions to be considered include working with the railroad to add a de-rail near our storage facility.  SPM&T is always looking for ways to improve process safety systems.\n\n"
