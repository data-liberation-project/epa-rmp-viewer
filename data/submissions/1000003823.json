      "SummaryText": "The Arch Chemicals, Inc. Rochester, N.Y. facility is committed to operating and maintaining its processes in a safe and responsible manner. This is done by a combination of employee training, accidental release prevention programs, and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public along with the environment. This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Arch has designed and implemented and includes:\n   + A brief description of the facility and use of substances regulated by the EPA Risk Management regulation.\n   + An overview of the worst case release and alternate case release scenarios required by the rule.\n   + An overview of the Arch accidental release prevention programs.\n   + The five year accident history for the facility.\n   + An overview of the plant emergency response program.\n   + An overview of planned improvements at the facility to minimize the number and severity of release incidents.\n   + Certification of the executive summary and risk management plan.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF FACILITY\n\nThe Arch Rochester facility produces biocides, wood treatment, personal care and specialty chemical products.The Arch biocide products are ingredients in dandruff shampoos, marine and anti-foulant paints, and coatings. They are also used to prevent formation of mold and mildew in wall board. The wood protection chemicals are used for wood protection and preservation. Personal care products include ingredients in various lotions and creams. Specialty chemicals are used in pharmaceutical, paint,coatings, and other products. The Arch Rochester facility has been in operation since 1950 and currently employs 158 employees. The plant operates 24 hours per day seven days per week and 365 days per year. The facility is ISO 9000 and Responsible CARE 14000 certified.\n\nThe Arch Rochester facility handles one toxic chemical, chlorine, regulated by the EPA risk management regulation. Chlorine is"

      "SummaryText": "used as a raw material and is received in 90 ton railcars. The maximum inventory of chlorine on site would be approximately 360,000 pounds. Arch does not handle any of the EPA listed flammable chemicals.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe EPA Risk Management regulation requires that each facility subject to the rule provide a worst case release scenario for toxic and flammable chemicals and an alternate release scenario for each toxic chemical handled. The Arch Rochester facility does not handle any of the EPA listed flammable chemicals. Following are the worst case and alternate release scenarios for chlorine at the Arch Rochester facility.\n    WORST CASE\nAs required by the EPA Risk Management regulation, the worst case is presumed to be a release from the largest vessel or container. For this site, the largest vessel is the railcar the chlorine is received in. Thus, using the assumptions required by the rule, the worst case release would be 180,000 pounds of chlorine released to air in a 10 minute period. As the regulation requires, the wind speed is assumed to be 1.5m/sec, the temperature is 25 degrees celsius, and the relative humidity is 50%.\n\nArch has many layers of safety implemented to ensure that such an out right failure of a railcar can not occur.Some of these measures are:\n   +Substantial construction of chlorine railcars per ASTM codes\n   +Regular preventive maintainance of chlorine railcars and ancillary equipment\n   +Excess flow valves installed on each car to minimize a release\n   +Chlorine monitors in chlorine handling areas to give early warning of a release\n   +Written operating procedures for handling and unloading railcars\n   +Highly trained employees that perform handling operations.\n\n   ALTERNATE RELEASE\nThe alternate release of chlorine assumes a leak and subsequent vaporization of chlorine from the 2- dichloropyridine manufacturing process. The entire contents of the chlorine process piping system would be released due to"

High standards are maintained throughout each stage to insure compliance with all applicable safety and environmental regulations.This certification process is known as  Safety in Engineering, Technology, Constuction, and Operations' or SETCO process.\n\nAll of these elements work together to prev"

Arch has committed to a management system that minimizes the possiblities of a chemical release. In December 2003, the Arch Rochester facility received certification as one of the American Chemistry Council`s Responsible Care 14000 facilities. This involves a considerable effort to continuously improve the plant safety and environmental performance. Arch also has a  Goal Is Zero initiative in which Arch facilities have a goal of achieving zero incidents of any kind--- zero injuries, zero accidental releases of chemicals, zero impact on its neighbors.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nArch has had no chemical release incidents of risk management regulated chemicals that resulted in on site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or had any off site impact in this five year period.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nArch maintains a comprehensive emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Monroe County emergency response plan. The Arch plan provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting the employees, the public, and the environment on an ongoing basis and during emergencies. Arch jointly conducts training and emergency drills with the local fire department and other emergency agencies. \n\nPLANNED SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nArch is committed to the continual improvement of its safety and environmental programs.
