Ethyl mercaptan, an odorant, is also stored at the terminal and is injected into the propane stream to odorize the propane prior to truck and rail loading.  The facility is completely automated and is available for around the clock loading by trained, qualified drivers.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\tNot applicable\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\n\tNot applicable\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nDome Petroleum Corp has determined the worst case scenario at the St. Clair facility is a vapor cloud explosion of the 40,000 gallon aboveground flare recovery tank.  This tank contains a maximum of 35,000 gallons (85% storage capacity) of an approximate 80% butane 20% propane mixture.  The scenario was based on the remote possibility of the tank being compromised due to physical  or mechanical damage.  The distance to 1 PSI overpressure has been calculated at .455 miles.  Dome Petroleum Corp. has determined  that the following public receptors are within the .455 miles (200 residents, 35 homes, 9 commercial businesses, one meeting hall, one golf course, and 15 fishing shacks).  No environmental receptors were found.  To eliminate potential fuel and ignition sources, the following control measures are :  (1) the area near the storage tanks is rocked; (2) a vegetation control program is in place; and (3)"
