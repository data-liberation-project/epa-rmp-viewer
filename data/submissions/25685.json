The quantities of chlorine planned for use exceed the applicability thresholds for the California Accidental Release (CalARP)/EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and the OSHA Process Safety\n\nManagement (PSM) program for worker safety.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response Policy\nIt is the policy of the HMPI management to implement the requirements of this RMP.  This RMP was developed in accordance with the CalARP (California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5) and in accordance with EPA regulations (40 CFR Part 68, Section 112r).  The objective of these programs is to minimize the risk of a release of regulated chemicals and, if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to HMPI's employees, the public and the environment. This objective will be accomplished by utilizing equipment designed for safe operation; by utilizing good operating procedures; by providing appropriate training to affected employees; and by coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the on-site and off-site emergency response providers.  HMPI's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\n\nFacility Description\n\nHMPI is located at 13429 Alondra Avenue, Santa Fe Springs, California.  The facility contact is Bob Pliska, Director, Environment, Health/Safety & Quality.  HMPI is a precious metal recovery facility.  HMPI uses a variety of chemical and thermal treatment technologies to recover and purify precious metals from industrial catalysts and other secondary materials.  HMPI also manufactures various precious metal-containing chemicals that are used to manufacture new industrial catalysts.\n\nProcess and Equipment Description\n\nHMPI plans to use chlorine as a chemical reagent in a process for t"

The chlorine is introduced into a slurry of the material to serve as the oxidizing agent and chloride source for the dissolution of precious and other metals.  HMPI will feed liquid chlorine from the one-ton container to supply the process requirements.  \nThe chlorine system to be installed is comprised of two (2) one-ton chlorine containers, two (2) secondary containment storage vessels, a chlorine evaporator, four reactor vessels, and the necessary piping and valves to distribute chlorine to the four process vessels.  Emissions from the reactors are vented to an existing air pollution control scrubber.  A monitoring system consisting of sensors located adjacent to each storage vessel, the evaporator and each reactor will detect chlorine releases from the system and shut off the chlorine supply if a release is detected.\n\nThe secondary containment storage vessels for the one-ton containers are the ChlorTainerTM manufactured by TGO Technologies.  The ChlorTainerTM is designed to fully contain a catastrophic release of chlorine from the primary container.  The ChlorTainerTM is equipped with an automatic valve that will shut off the chlorine feed from the container in the event of an earthquake or power failure.  In addition, chlorine feed is shut off if any of the chlorine sensors surrounding the system detect a chlorine leak.\nThe chlorine evaporator vaporizes liquid chlorine for distribution to the process.  The chlorine evaporator is designed according to industry standards for safe and effective operation.\nThe reactor vessels are filled with a slurry of base material.  The vaporized chlorine is injected into the reactor vessel where it oxidizes the precious metals so that they can be recovered from the base material.  A majority of the chlorine is consumed in the process.\nThe unreacted chlorine is emitted from the process reactor to an existing three-stage wet chemical scrubber.  A sol"

The chlorine in the containers is liquefied and under pressure.  Both chlorine containers will be connected to the process; the maximum amount of chlorine to be connected to the process at any time is therefore 4000 pounds.  No additional one-ton containers will be stored on-site.  There are typically four (4) 150-pound chlorine cylinders on-site for use in a separate precious metal purification process.  The CalARP RMP requirements are process specific, and as the process using the 150-pound cylinders is a separate process, the storage and use of chlorine in the purification process will not be addressed further in this RMP.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Document was used to define the worst-case release scenario for chlorine.  The worst-case release scenario is based on a release of the entire contents of a one-ton chlorine container within ten minutes at low wind speed and very stable atmospheric conditions.  The impact of the release is evaluated as the distance required for the chlorine concentration to dilute down to a level that would not have serious impact to the health of an average person, if exposed to that concentration for a period of up to one hour.  This concentration is referred to as the \"toxic endpoint\".  The EPA RMP*CompTM dispersion model was used to estimate the distance to the chlorine endpoint.  The endpoint distance for the release of one-ton of chlorine is estimated to be approximately 1.3 miles from the HMPI facility in any direction.   There are approximately 20,900 persons residing within 1.3 miles of the HMPI facility.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is consistent with a release from a ruptured container, a sheared valve from the chlorine container, or broken liqui"

Chlorine containers are constructed of approximately one-half inch thick steel and are designed to survive transportation accidents without failure; therefore a rupture of a container is highly unlikely.  The valves on a one-ton container are recessed into the end of the container and are protected during transport and handling by a protective steel cover and, therefore, the shearing of a valve is highly unlikely. \n\nIn addition, HMPI has established procedures for safe unloading of containers, for transferring containers to the ChlorTainerTM storage vessel by an overhead crane, and for safe connection and disconnection of containers to prevent chlorine releases.  When in position in the ChlorTainerTM, the chlorine containers are prevented from rolling by guardrails within the ChlorTainerTM.  The chlorine piping outside the ChlorTainerTM will be installed with secondary containment, and will be protected from damage by structural steel support members, and therefore, a catastrophic release is unlikely.  A chlorine monitoring system adjacent to the ChlorTainerTM storage vessels will automatically close the chlorine feed valve if a chlorine leak is detected, further reducing the probability of catastrophic release.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based upon a release rate of 6.7 pounds per minute for a ten-minute duration.  This release rate is consistent with a rupture of either the liquid or gas side piping from the evaporator, with the evaporator operating at the maximum rated evaporative capacity.  The release duration is based on the assumption that the monitoring system and automatic valves will stop the chlorine supply by upon detection of the initial release.  The EPA RMP*CompTM model was used to estimate the distance to the chlorine endpoint.  The endpoint distance for the alternative release scenario was estimated to be one-t"

There are no residences within 0.1 miles of the HMPI facility.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe accident release prevention program features containment for the one-ton chlorine containers and double containment piping for the liquid chlorine.  The chlorine system is designed to shut down automatically if there is a leak in any section of the distribution system.  Additional safety systems include: \n? An automatic closing valve (electric powered, fail closed) that activates when a chlorine leak is detected, or in the event of a power failure for both of the one-ton container containment vessels; \n? A seismic detector to automatically activate the chlorine valve closure system when an earthquake exceeds a set threshold, whether or not a leak is detected; \n? Chlorine sensors in the storage area, evaporator room, process area, process vessel ventilation ducts, and scrubber exhaust stack; \n? Chlorine alarms (visual and audible) inside and outside the evaporator building; \n? Fenceline monitoring for chlorine;\n? A central chlorine alarm monitoring station;\n? Personal protective equipment (breathing apparatus) for chlorine handlers;\n? Training for system operators;\n? Written operating procedures;\n? An emergency response plan; and,\n? An emergency back-up electrical generator for power to critical systems, including the chlorine monitoring system. \n\nA Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) was conducted prior to the installation of the chlorine system; weaknesses in the system were identified and the system design improved to eliminate those weaknesses.

There have been no significant releases of chlorine in the last 5 years. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nHMPI has established an Emergency Response Program for the facility that relies on HMPI personnel trained to respond to chlorine releases as the first responders.  In addition, HMPI will conduct joint training exercises with the City of Santa Fe Springs Fire Department.  HMPI has established hazard communication procedures to make all employees and on-site contractors aware of the potential hazards associated with chlorine use and the response procedures applicable to a chlorine emergency.  HMPI intends to conduct an Emergency Response drill at least once per year.  The City of Santa Fe Springs Fire and Whittier Police Departments will handle public notification in the event of a release with potential off-site impact.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nPrior to constructing the full production scale chlorine process on-site; HMPI conducted a PHA of the chlorine system.  The PHA was conducted using a team of people experienced in hazard analysis, operating chlorine systems, operating precious metals recovery systems, and safety management.  Because the PHA was conducted prior to installation of the equipment, and the feasible mitigation measures and design improvements were incorporated into the system design, no changes are planned at this time to improve safety of the system."
