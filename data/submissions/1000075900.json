The plant is on a 14 ac. site located approximately 1 mile west of the center of town in Polk county Georgia.  Currently, GEO Specialty Chemicals, Inc. is a global manufacturer of a variety of industrial chemical products, including paints and coating products, water treatment chemicals, consumer additives, custom solutions resin additives, products, polyester liquids, powder resin coatings, and aqueous polyurethane dispersion resins.\n\n\n\n1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nGEO has a history of commitment to the town of Cedartown, surrounding community and our employees.  Our commitment is demonstrated in the resources invested in accident prevention such as safety and operations training of our personnel, incident investigations, and standards for design, installation, operations and maintenance of our processes.  The Cedartown facility has 3 major process areas and is operated 24 hr./day 365 days/year.  The facility stores three regulated substances in quantities above the Risk Management Plan [RMP] threshold.  These materials are RMP toxic substances.\n\n\n\n2.0 STATIONARY SOURCE & REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOleum [CAS# 7446-11-9].  Used in the production of sulfonated naphthalene intermediates; the precursor for all LOMAR products as well as the alkyl sulfonated naphthalene.\n\nFormaldehyde [CAS# 50-00-0].  Used in the condensation reaction step of the LOMAR products and alkyl sulfonated naphthalene.  Smaller quantities are used in other products.\n\nCyclohexylamine [CAS# 102-71-2].  Used in the neutralization step of certain alkyl naphthalene sulfonates.\n\n\n\n3.0 KEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our"
