      "SummaryText": "Background:\r\nGreat Lakes Cheese owns and operates a processed cheese production plant in La Crosse, Wisconsin.  Refrigeration is necessary to maintain the low temperatures required for food processing and product storage. Great Lakes Cheese uses anhydrous ammonia (CAS#7662-41-7) as the refrigerant. Ammonia is an environmentally friendly and efficient choice for industrial applications. Due to its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.    \r\n\r\nReason for Resubmission:\r\nThe maximum intended inventory was recently recalculated, and there was a slight increase.  The inventory revision is the reason for this resubmission.  Please note that the additional ammonia was not enough to increase the circle of impact.  \r\n\r\nCommitment:\r\nGreat Lakes Cheese is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. The refrigeration system complies with local building and fire codes, and appropriate industry-consensus codes and standards, including ASHRAE and IIAR.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\r\nIn order to prevent accidental releases, Great Lakes Cheese maintains the system in accordance with all aspects of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases, as defined in 40 CFR Part 68.42 (a), within the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nGreat Lakes Cheese maintains a written emergency action plan. The plan includes first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, and follow up.  The plan is updated as appropriate to reflect any changes within the facility that would impact emergency response. Great Lakes Cheese coordinates emergency response activities with the La Crosse Fire Department and the La Crosse County Emergency Management Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nContinuing Efforts to Improve Safet"
