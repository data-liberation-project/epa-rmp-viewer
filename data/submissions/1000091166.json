The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials. Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis. In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases. \r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 22312 Railroad Avenue in San Joaquin, California (the \"facility\"). Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer. There are two aqueous ammonia storage tanks located at the facility with capacities of approximately 8,000 gallons and 15,000 gallons. The two aqueous ammonia tanks are located within secondary containment. The contents of the tanks are used as a pH adjuster during onsite blending of nutrient chemicals. \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying with the requirements and guidelines set forth by the California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) and Federal Risk Management Program.

Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility. Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\nFive-Year Accident History \r\n\r\nThere have been no qualifying accidents involving ammonia in the five-year period prior to the completion of this Plan.\r\n \r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Fresno County Fire Department (\"fire department\") regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of ammonia. The facility has established emergency evacuation procedures to evacuate the site and notify the appropriate agencies regarding a release. The facility's emergency response program is documented in the facility's Emergency Response Procedures. The emergency procedures contain the following key elements: \r\n\r\n1. Procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to accidental releases. \r\n2. Information on emergency health care. \r\n3.

Update Mechanical Integrity procedures to define how instruments are check for accuracy. \r\n5. Update Mechanical Integrity procedures to include replacing the sparge water with clean water. \r\n6. Review and update Piping & Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID).\r\n\r\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describe methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company. The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing\r\nincidents and employee injuries by combining the GPS process with a positive safety culture."
