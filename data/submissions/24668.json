Union, Inc. are committed to the prevention  of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the \nfacility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Des Moines County LEPC, and/or other \nauthorities,  to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n  The primary activity at the facility is the storage fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is\nreceived, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximun\nquantity stored would be 530,000 pounds in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\na.   The worse-case scenario would be the release of total contents of a storage tank released as gas \nover a period of 10 min. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and \nadministrative control.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 3.3 miles.\n            \n b.     The alternate release scenario, a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes  or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.3 miles (the most likely potential incident from a break in a 1-inch transfer hose before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia would be the matter of seconds).\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facililty is in compli"

(ANSI), and the\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see Section 8.3 (b).\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused\nany deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, has there been\nany accidental releases resulted on off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or \nenvironmental damage.\n\n6.  Emergency Action Plan.\n\nThe facility has:\na.  A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.  Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know\ninformation as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess\nconditions at Golden Furrow -  Mt. Union, Inc. There is no additional specific safety\nrecommendations regarding storage or use of anhdrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
