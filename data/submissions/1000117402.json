The delivery vehicles are unloaded, the containers stored and then delivered to the final user. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride is considered hazardous under both Oregon and Federal regulations. Rinchem Company, manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices(e.g. alarms,relief devices)inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility. \n\nOur emergency action program is based upon OSHA's 1910.38 regulation. The emergency action plan includes procedrues for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental releases. \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n1.2 The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and redelivery of a variety or compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The Hydrogen Chloride is a regulated substance that is handled in quanties that exceed the EPA and Oregon State thresholds for regulated substances. \n\n1.3 The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply"

Rinchem has developed an emergency response program to minimize the effects of an accidental release of anhydrous hydrogen chloride to employees and a community notification process. Rinchem management has opted to respond to releases of these chemicals by containing the spill when it can be safely done and using contracted services for spill cleanup. The Tualatin gas pad Emergency Response Program consists of a Business Continuity Plan and facility specific \nEmergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Program outlines the instructions and required information in order to respond to fire, chemical spills, natural disasters, and other emergencies that may arise. The Emergency Action Plan and documents are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to reflect changes that may occur to content and structure\nof the plan.\nNotification exercises:\nIn response to the requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68.96(a), Rinchem has developed procedures to conduct an exercise of the stationary source's emergency response notification mechanisms. As all Rinchem Company, LLC facilities are nonresponding stationary sources, Rinchem management and EHS recognize the importance of communication to emergency\nresponse organizations that hazards that are present at Rinchem facilities.

Changes may be made to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry. Rinchem is always looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement, upgrades to equipment used in the process, and review of operating procedures. Rinchem believes that no changes are necessary at this\ntime to address improvement to safety at our facilities.
