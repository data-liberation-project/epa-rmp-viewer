The plant has a design flow of 17.2 million gallons per day (mgd) and consists of grit basins, bar screens, detriter grit tanks, complete and partial mix aerated lagoons, dual media filtration, chloringe disinfection, and the addition of sulfur dioxide to remove excess chlorine.  The facility uses between 300 to 500 pounds of chlorine per day.  The chlorine storage building is a cinder block building with the capacity to store 4 cylinders of chlorine (2000 lbs each).  Currently the facility stores up to 4000 lbs of chlorine.  Granular calcium hypochlorite is also stored at the facility in a separate building.\n\nThe City of Nogales, Arizona (City) and the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) jointly own the plant.  It is currently being operated by the USIBWC under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit of July 2001 and an Aquifer Protection Permit of March 2003.  Design for an upgraded plant, with a design flow of 14.0 mgd, is scheduled for 2006.  \n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at facility:\n\nUSIBWC Safety and Health Policy Statement:\n\nThe USIBWC's goal is to provide safe and efficient performance-based management and operating services to all employees of the USIBWC.  We strongly believe that all accidents are preventable and that all tasks can be completed without injury or property damage.  Our commitment to proactive safety management; continuously improving processes; complying with state, federal, and local requirements (as applicable); and employee involvement will cultivate a strong safety culture and assist in the achievement of the Commissioner's goal of Zero Accidents.\n\nThe USIBWC Saf"

An Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Tier II inventory of the bulk storage of hazardous chemicals is submitted annually, and in February of 2005, an emergency response plan questionnaire was completed and submitted to the aforementioned agencies.  A hazard communication training program is in place and monthly safety meetings are held.  During May 2005, a drill of the NIWTP Emergency Response Plan was conducted with the local Emergency Planning Committee. The drill simulated a major uncontrollable leak in a one-ton chlorine cylinder. The Rio Rico Fire District, Tubac Fire Department, and the Nogales Fire Department were the principle responders. The exercise served to familiarize the Fire Departments with the NIWTP system and to review NIWTP staff procedures.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response plan that includes policies for the prevention of accidental releases of chlorine gas, sulfur dioxide, and calcium hypochlorite.  Personnel have been trained and fitted with self contained breathing apparatus which are stored and accessible in case of an accidental release.  Personnel are trained in the proper procedures for handling, storing, and using chlorine gas, sulfur dioxide, and calcium hypochlorite, and connecting/disconnecting the pressurized cylinders.

The facility is being upgraded to lessen the dependence on extremely hazardous substances while improving the quality of the treated effluent. Chlorine cylinders in service are contained in Chlortainers\u00ae for safety.  The chlortainers were installed in 2003 and 2004.  There are currently failsafes on the Chlortainers\u00ae  that are tied into the gas alarm system which automatically shuts down the gas feeds if chlorine gas is detected in either the control room of the chlorine building or in the actual tank room, this will occur during a power failure as well. \n\nAggressive environmental compliance and safety and health programs are in place to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, continuously m"

A chlorine repair kit is located in the control room of the administrative building, and a spill kit including booms is accessible to personnel.  \r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:\r\n\r\nThe facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency response program: \r\n\r\nAn emergency response program is in place which includes planned notification procedures to the local emergency response units in the order of proximity to the facility, and the public through the Emergency Services Coordinator.  Procedures for evacuation of personnel including transport location, route, and accounting are included in the facility plan.  A site map and transportation routes to the wastewater facil"

      "SummaryText": "ity in relation of the local area have been provided to the AERC, LEPC, and RRFD.  Cellular phones and handheld radios are available and would be used by facility personnel in an emergency situation.  The chlorine storage building is a cinder block building with the capacity to store 8 cylinders of chlorine (2000 lbs each).  The building has safety shut-off valves and audible and electronic emergency alarms in case of leaks. Continuous monitoring chlorine gas and sulfur dioxide detectors are on-hand to monitor gas leaks.  Should an accidental release occur, an alarm would be activated in the administrative building.  For after-hours releases, the alarm would activate an automatic call out system.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid tampering with empty cylinders, the facility is planning to install an eight foot fence around the loading dock of the chlorine storage building.  The facility is being upgraded to lessen the dependence on extremely hazardous substances while improving the quality of the treated effluent.  These upgrades are expected to be completed within the next three to five years.\r\n\r\nAggressive environmental compliance and safety and health programs are in place to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, continuously monitor procedures and implement strategies for improvements.  Corrections to the Risk Management Plan will be submitted as required."
