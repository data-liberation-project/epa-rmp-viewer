      "SummaryText": "Chlorine gas is used by the Salisbury-Rowan Utilities (City of Salisbury) in the operation of our Water Treatment Plant for disinfection of raw water and to maintain the final disinfectant levels required for distribution of a safe finished product (potable drinking water). Six one ton cylinders are stored in a separate dedicated building. A chlorine leak detector is located in this building with an audible alarm.This device is checked monthly and replaced annually. Vacuum regulators are located on all ton cylinders to eliminate all pressurized lines. Operators wear SCBA gear when changing cylinders to provide them protection and time to repair any connections that may be leaking during a change out. If the alarm sounds detecting a chlorine release at anytime other than cylinder change outs, 911 is called to dispatch the HazMat Team and all plant site personnel are evacuated. The City of Salisbury is fortunate to have a team trained to this response level located within six (6) blocks of the Water Treatment Plant. Operators carry radios with them when on duty that allow direct communications with 911 operators and fire personnel when necessary. The HazMat Team is equipped with gas detectors for determining the vapor cloud concentrations. They are also trained and equipped to repair the chlorine ton cylinders or place an end cap enclosure should a valve stem break. Our LEPC is well aware of the consequences of a chlorine release. The results of this updated RMP will be communicated to them at their next meeting.Training, drills, inspections, and review and updating of all safety procedures and policies will continue to be a priority. Compliance with all federal and state requirments such as the OSHA PSM rule will continue to be emphasized. In reviewing our five (5) year accident history, no accidental releases, evacuations or injuries have occurred. As a result of our Vulnerability Assessment, we will completely update our Emergency Response Plan by December 31, 2004"

      "SummaryText": ". A reverse 911 system will be installed within the next year which will enhance our ability to alert the public of any accidental releases. Construction is currently underway that will double our Water Treatment Plant capacity. As part of this expansion, chlorine gas will be eliminated as a disinfectant and replaced by sodium hyperchlorite. At the time this new system becomes operational, we will submit a request to de-register the site."
