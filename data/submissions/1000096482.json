For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.\r\n\r\nOther safety features of the ammonia refrigeration system include: ammonia sensors that sound a facility-wide alarm, an emergency shutdown button that kills power to engine room equipment, relief valves on all pressure vessels, and continuous ventilation in the engine room to prevent ammonia explosions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, the facility has based its maintenance program on the industry standard: the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems is used at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nAn investigation into the Brewster Cheese accident history showed that there had been no reportable accidents with ammonia in the last 5 years. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nBrewster Cheese - Stockton, IL has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Facility Safety Manual located in the Safety Coordinator's office. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.)  To save lives\r\n  2.)  To minimize and avoid injuries\r\n  3.)  To protect the environment\r\n  4.)  To minimize property damage\r\n\r\nThe Brewster Cheese - Stockton, IL facility maintains a PSM Team, whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure comp"
