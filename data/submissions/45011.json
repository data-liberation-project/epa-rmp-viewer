The Facility Policy\n\n          The owners, management, and employees of Kova Fertilizer @ Cortland are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Emergency Management Agency, LEPC, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n          -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to area farmers.\n          - Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed to area farmers as a vital crop\n             production nutrient (nitrogen).\n          -The maximum amount stored at this facility would be 132,600 pounds (25,500 gallons) in our 18,000 \n            gallon and 12,000 gallons storage tanks.  Product is routinely loaded into 1000 gallon mobile tanks for pick-up by and \n            sale to area farmers.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\n      a. The worst case scenario for this facility would be the release of the total contents of the largest  \n          tank (18000 gallons) storage tank as a gas over a 10 minute time span.  The maximum quantity \n          released would be 80,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 \n          percent capacity as limited by design standards, industry recommendations, and company policy.  \n         The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) has been calculated for this rural \n          community as 1.89 miles.\n      b. The alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history and/or \"most likely to \n           happen\" release "

      "SummaryText": "information.  For this facility, we have made our calculation based on hose rupture \n           during load-out thru a 1inch fill line and a simultaneous emergency excess flow valve fails  to close \n           during rapid flow rate changes associated with the hose rupture.  The distance to endpoint (point of \n           dispersion to 200 ppm) is .22 miles (1160 ft.).  Since this filling process is always supervised by an \n           employee, we calculate maximum time of escape to be two (2) minutes before a secondary shut-off \n           measure can be initiated.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n           This facility has instituted the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of \n           Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the \n           standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \n           \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-Year Accident History\n\n          There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia from this facility in the past five \n          years that:\n           - have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n           - to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, \n             property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program.\n\n        -The facility has:\n          a.   A written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and            \n                Secondary Containment Regulations for the State of Indiana;\n          b.  Provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know \n                information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA)\n          c.  A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, \n               including pre-emergency "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n           Safe operations of our facility is an on-going process and is constantly reviewed as new \n     knowledge is generated and additional regulations impact our industry.  Periodic evaluations are \n     performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous \n     ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this site at this time."
