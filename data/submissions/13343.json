This is a worst case scenario, which assumes the entire contents of a one ton cylinder escapes within a ten minute period of time.  This scenario assumes a worst case wind speed of 1.5 mile per hour, 25 degrees celsius and a F stability.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l (3ppm).\n\nAlternative Scenario\n\nUsing the same guidance document the calculated distance to the toxic endpoint for and accidential release of chlorine is 0.2 miles or 1056 feet.  This alternative scenario assumes a wind speed of 3 meters per second, 25 degrees celsius and a D stability.  This alternative scenario is calculated based on the release of the entire contents of a chlorine cylinder over a period of eighteen minutes.  This is less than the rate of release for the worst case scenario because it takes into account the mitigating effect of the chlorine cylinders being inside.  This alternative scenario represent an accidential release that is more likely to occur than that of the worst case scenario.\n\nOffsite Receptors (Worst Case Scenario)\n\nIn the worst case scenario the 1.3 mile distance to endpoint would include a large residential area, several schools, public parks and business establishments.

It does not include any residential or commercial areas and a more realistic effected population would be the 25 day shift employees that work at the Water Reclamation Plant.  It does extend beyond the facility boundaries slightly to the north, which includes a commercial gravel pit and to the south which includes about one quarter mile of 37th Street (a major east west travel corridor).

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe Purpose of the Risk Management Plan\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires facilities, which use potentially hazardous material, to assess the risks of any accidental release and develop a plan to minimize these risks.  These regulations are referred to as the Risk Management Plan and are found in section 112. of The Clean Air.  It is the intent of these regulations to reduce the number of offsite injuries and death that could occur from the accidental release of a hazardous substance.\n\nWhat this Regulation Covers\n\nThe Rochester Water Reclamation Plant is the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) which treats the wastewater from the City of Rochester and its residents under the authority of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).  As a wastewater treatment plant the Rochester Water Reclamation Plant uses chemical that are common to the industry, including chlorine.  Chlorine is regulated under the risk management plan when used in quantities greater than 2,500 pounds (maximum use in the process).  Chlorine is stored in one ton (2,000 pound cylinders).  \n\nChlorine\n\nThe Water Reclamation Plant is required by its NPDES permit to continuously disinfect its discharge from April through November of every year.  Chlorine has been used for many years as an economical safe, effective agent for disinfection.  To ensure that disinfection is not interrupted when changing chlorine cylinders, it is common in the wastewater industry to have multiple cylinders connected at one time.  Once a cylinder is exhausted the system automatically switches over to the back-up cylinders, thus ensuring an uninterrupted supply to meet the continuous disinfection requirement.  Because more than one cylinder is hooked up at a time, the process is considered to have greater than 2,500 pounds of chlorine in it at one time.  Thus the Risk Management program rules apply.  \n\nOther Alternatives\n\nAlthough it is possible to obtain chlorine in smalle"

      "SummaryText": "r 150 pound cylinders, this size is impractical for use at the Water Reclamation Plant.  The use of 150 pound cylinder at the Water Reclamation Plant would exhaust more than one cylinder every day.  Although the use of these smaller cylinders would eliminate the need for complying with the Risk Management Plan it would create a greater hazard in the number of connections which have to be made.  Connecting and changing of cylinders is an operation that can potentially cause an accidental release.  Therefore, an appropriate sized cylinder is the safest all around alternative.  Chlorine is also available in larger rail car sized containers.\n\n \nWhat is Not Regulated\n\nAlthough the Water Reclamation Plant uses other chemicals, none of them are used in quantities above regulated threshhold quantities.  The Water Regulation Plant does neutralize the chlorine in its discharge prior to mixing with the receiving stream, the South Fork of the Zumbro River.  Instead of using a regulated chemical such as sulfur dioxide, the Water Reclamation Plant uses a safer alternative, liquid sodium bisulfite.  \n\nFlammable substances stored in quantities equal or greater than 10,000 pounds are also covered by the Risk Management Plan Regulations.  Although the Water Reclamation Plant does store methane ( a byproduct of wastewater solids digestion), it does not have the capacity to store enough to be regulated (see figure 1). \n\nFigure 1\nMaximum Methane Storage Calculations\n\nThe Water Reclamation Plant does store digester gas in a 50-foot diameter high-pressure (Maximum 45 PSI) gas storage sphere.  \nThe following is a summary of the maximum storage calculations based on the formulas given in the Risk Management Program EPA Guidance Document for Wastewater Treatment Plants EPA 550-B-98-010:\n\nVolume of Sphere (V)\n\nV = 4/3 3.14 x R^3\nV = 4/3 3.14 (25)^3 = 65,417 Ft^3\n\nR = Radius = 25 feet\n\nDensity of Methane (Pm)\n\nPm = 0.22 X / (460 + T)\nPm = (0.22) (70) / (460+1)= 0.0334 pounds per Ft^3\n\nX = Perc"
