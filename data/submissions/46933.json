These manuals are routinely updated.\n\nFive-year Accident History (? 68.155(d))\n\nThere were not any RMP accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response Program (? 68.155(e))\n\nThe Pedricktown PVC facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response team (?ERT?) trained in these emergency response procedures. The team is comprised of employees from PolyOne, OxyVinyls and Noveon.  All plant personnel are trained in evacuation procedures and in-plant drills are conducted periodically.  The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Operations Center (?EOC?).  In addition, the Pedricktown PVC facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (?SSP?) which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  The Special Situation Plan links the local response to the OxyChem Corporate Emergency Response Center located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nThe facility is a member of the Oldmans Township Local Emergency Planning Committee (?LEPC?), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (? 68.155(f))\n\nThe Pedricktown PVC facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.\n\nCertification Statement\n\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\n\n\n       Robert J.
