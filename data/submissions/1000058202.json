WBC is committed to the safe operation of our ammonia refrigeration system.\n\nThe system was designed and maintained in accordance with:\n\nThe American National Standard for Equipment, Design and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems\n\nThe American National Standard: Safety Code for Mechanical Refrigeration\n\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Minimum Safety Criteria for a Safe Ammonia\n\nRefrigeration System.\n\nGuidelines for Ammonia Machinery Room Ventilation.\n\nGuidelines for Identification of Ammonia Refrigeration Piping and System Components.\n\n- Furthermore, senior management provides the resources and support necessary to maintain a safe system and ensure appropriate training. The corporate safety policy is to operate an accident - free environment by performing all our work in the safest possible manner. Management is responsible for preventing injuries and every individual associate is responsible for following safe work practices.\n\n- The ammonia system refrigerates our dairy building and automated storage & retrieval system(asrs) . The facility processes milk, juices and teas primarily for the Wawa convenience stores. Raw product is pasteurized and bottled on the Dairy and finished product is warehoused in the asrs building and then loaded onto our trucks and shipped out to the stores.\n\n-The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system consists of a single stage system that provides glycol chilling for process cooling, milk cooler, automated storage and retrieval area cooling and cooling of various tanks and silos.\n\n-Over the past five years we focused on maintaining compliance with OSHA Process safety Management Regulations. We formed a team consisting of management, front line associates and environmental health and safety professionals to focus on complian"

The team meets on a routine basis to update programs, review proposed changes and modifications and address safety issues and concerns.\n\n-WBC developed a program to implement associate participation into process safety management policy, development and implementation. Associates (management & frontline) are consulted on the development and maintenance of all aspects of the PSM program. Furthermore, all information with regards to the ammonia refrigeration system (prints, policies, etc.) is available to associates and emergency responders.\n\n-Process Hazard Analysis are conducted to identify, evaluate and control the hazards associated with the ammonia refrigeration process. A team of associates with expertise in engineering and process operations, knowledge of processes being evaluated and knowledge of the specific analysis methods utilized perform the PHA updates and reviews. PHA reviews are conducted in compliance with the Management of Change program.\n\n-The PSM Team developed and implemented standard operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities regarding the ammonia refrigeration system. The procedures include steps for each operating phase operating limits and safety and health considerations. The team reviews the Standard Operating Procedures annually. In addition, the SOP's are reviewed in coordination with the management of change program.\n\n-WBC implemented a training program that exceeds regulatory requirements. All associates receive an overview of the system and process safety process management program, as well as annual evacuation training. Furthermore, our ammonia refrigeration mechanics receive the three year training, but also receive additional training when warranted or requested.\n\n- In order to protect associates, the community and environment, WBC maintains strict controls over work practices of all vendors and contractors. The program incorporates pre and post bid activitie"

Associates involved in maintaining the ongoing integrity of process equipment have been trained in the procedures applicable to the associate's job task. Inspection and testing is performed on process equipment, using procedures that follow recognized and accepted good engineering practices.\n\n- WBC fully evaluates changes to the ammonia refrigeration system to fully assess their impact to associate, community and environmental safety and to determine needed changes to operating procedures. The management of change program requires a four step process: initiation, pre-modification checklist, prestart up safety review, and a final sign off.\n\n- Pre Startup Safety Reviews are conducted to ensure new and modified equipment is ready and safe for start-up. The Pre Start up Safety Review confirms construction and equipment is designed in accordance with specifications, safety, operating and maintenance procedures are in place and adequate, a process hazard analysis was performed and recommendations were resolved before startup and training was conducted.\n\n- Hot Work permits are issued for hot work operations conducted on or near ammonia refrigeration system. The permits documents that fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to the initiation of hot work operations.\n\n- A team of associates investigates every incident that results in or could have reasonably resulted in a catastrophic release. The Team establishes the root cause of the incident and identifies corrective actions to prevent the incident from occurring again.\n\n-Compliance audits are conducted every three years by a third party consultant in order to verify procedures and practice developed under the standard are adequate, accurate and implemented.
