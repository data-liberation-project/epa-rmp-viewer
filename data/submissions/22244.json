Vanitico occupies the northeast quadrant of the manufacturing area that was formally Ciba Specialities Chemicals Corporation.  This site was purchased from Ciba Specialty in June 1, 2000 and presently is operating with 223 employees.  This site is part of the Polymer Specialties Division (Area 12/19) and produces specialty polymers and basic liquid epoxy resins.  As the former Polymers Division of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Vantico  participated in the OSHA Star program and will continue to strive towards safety excellence.\nIn addition it is a  worldwide  member of the chemical industries  Responsible Care program.  We maintain a staff of EHS professionals who are trained/educated  in their respective areas and provide professional training to our employees.   \nVantico strives to be an accepted part of the community by being a good citizen.  We focus daily on all laws and regulations in order to protect the health and safety of our employees, our community, and the environment.  Our current OSHA Recordable injury rate is 1.2 and the site has worked greater than 337,000 hours without a lost time injury.  \n\nThe Clean Air Act Amendments (Section 112 r) mandated by the EPA requires a Risk Management Plan (RMP) which requires covered sites to perform an Offsite Consequence Analysis by determining its Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\nEpichlorohydrin is the only chemical that is covered by RMP with inventories of 3,400,000 lbs which exceeds the threshold amount of 20,000 lbs.\nThe Worst Case was based on the highly unlikely scenario of complete failure of an Epichlorohydrin railcar without any mitigation.  This consists of the release of 187,000 lbs of the chemical from the railcar in 10 minutes assuming the worst possible weather conditions. The toxic end point is 20 ppm and 5.8 miles.
