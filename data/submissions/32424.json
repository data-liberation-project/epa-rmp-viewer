Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\nThe management and employees of Lincoln Land FS, Inc.are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Winchester Fire Department, Scott County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at  97 N. Commercial Winchester IL., is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of one 26,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 394,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and\nalternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive\ninformation as requested by EPA.\n\n4. The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling"

The emergency response program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Winchester Fire Department and Scott County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
