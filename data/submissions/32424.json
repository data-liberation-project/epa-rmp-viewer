Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of one 26,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 394,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: This facility has developed a worst-case and\nalternative-case scenario however it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive\ninformation as requested by EPA.\n\n4.

Five year accident history.                                                                                                                             \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Winchester Fire Department and Scott County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
