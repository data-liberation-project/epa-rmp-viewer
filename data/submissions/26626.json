The owners, management, and employees of the Radium Branch are committed to the prevention of any accidental relesase of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work and assist the local emergency response authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.  The faciltiy is located on the west side of Radium, Kansas.  The primary acitivity at this location is storage for grain, chemicals, and fertilizer.  Chemicals and fertilizers are stored for retail sale to producers of agricultural products.  The maximum storage capacity of anhydrous ammonia at this location is 388,500 pounds, which included storage tanks and portable nurse tanks.\n\n3.  WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The worst case scenario would be thr release of the total contents of the bulk storage tanks.  The maximum release would be 159,000 pounds, the distance to end point would be 2.0 miles with approximately 102 people affected.\n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative relase scenario is a release from a ruptured transfer hose.  The release of approximately 2400 pounds would travel .3 miles and affect about 52 people.  The population of Randium, Kansas is around 45 people.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The Great Bend Coop is a Farmland Industries AG-21 member.  AG-21 is a program that is environmental driven.  The Coop strives to go above and beyond industry standards for the safety of customer, employee, and the environment.\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia whitin the past five years at this facility.\n\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.  The Coop's Safety Committee which is comprised of a representative from each Department and Branch.  The committee tours a Branch or Department once a month.  All areas are toured"
