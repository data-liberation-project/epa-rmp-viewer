KNC?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators. \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Crawfordsville Terminal is one of many facilities owned and operated by KNC that supply anhydrous ammonia to the Midwest farming area where it is used primarily as a fertilizer.  At the terminal, anhydrous ammonia is delivered by pipeline and stored until it is loaded on to trucks for distribution.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is the only toxic substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Crawfordsville Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\n?Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \n?Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\n?Operating and maintaining assets in such a m"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\n?Minimizing the possibility that flare combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having continuous pilots.\n?Minimizing the possibility that combustion of ammonia vapors would be interrupted by having a backup connection to a second power grid.\n?Requiring trucks to have a brake interlock system that helps prevent a truck driver from driving away before the transfer hose is properly disconnected.\n?Providing annual truck loading training to ensure driver safety. \n?Ammonia sensors in the process areas and on the property to detect ammonia and activate the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition monitoring system if the threshold for ammonia is exceeded.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Crawfordsville Ammonia Terminal has had one incident occur during the last five years that is reportable in the five-year accident history maintained under the RMP regulations.  In April 2006, an operations technician was working on a pilot valve on the Number 3 loading rack.  When the technician began removing the top of the pilot valve, ammonia was released on his face, neck and arms.  The technician showered off and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  He was given initial treatment at the hospital then moved to the "

As a result of this incident, the maintenance procedure was modified to specify which valves would be used for isolation as well as blowing down pressure during this operation.  An equipment-specific lock out/tag out procedure was written for this task that specifies which valves are necessary for isolation, relieving pressure, and how to check for isolation.  Also, the incident was reviewed with all terminal employees to communicate the causal and contributing factors of this incident.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe terminal will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Crawfordsville Terminal with the Crawfordsville Fire Department.  Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Montgomery County Sheriff and, as appropriate, the Culver Union Hospital, the Indiana Gas Company, the Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the Indiana State Highway Patrol.  The Crawfordsville Operations Technician is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program, coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby lead"

The terminal coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
