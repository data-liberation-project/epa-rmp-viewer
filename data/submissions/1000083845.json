      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe Municipal Plant #3 is located at 119 West 24th Street, in the northeast section of Laurel. On average the plant treats 2 to 3 million gallons of groundwater per day and uses approximately 70 pounds of chlorine per day. The Plant has never had a chlorine-related accident above the RQ and has never had any incident that affected a public receptor. This safety record can be attributed to the awareness and conscientiousness of the administration and staff.\n\nTo further improve the overall safety of the plant, a Risk Management Plan has been developed for chlorine, a hazardous chemical used in the water treatment process. When dealing with hazardous chemicals, it is imperative to take all necessary precautions to protect the safety of the employees and the surrounding community. The Municipal Plant #3 has accomplished this through employee safety training, the use of proper methods and equipment for handling chlorine, and the preparation of emergency response procedures.\n\nChlorine is an essential chemical in the treatment of drinking water. It is a strong disinfectant and is used in the treatment process to eliminate any pathogenic organisms in the final supply. The chlorine at Plant #3 is stored on-site in one ton containers on a concrete pad adjacent to the chlorination shed near the center of the facility. Currently, the plant stores a maximum of 4000 pounds of chlorine on site at one time. The chlorination shed serves to supply, meter, and apply the chlorine to the final water stream.\n\nChlorine is listed by the EPA as an extremely hazardous substance (EHS.) It has a characteristic penetrating odor and is greenish yellow in the gas phase and clear amber under pressure in the liquid phase. Chlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant, while liquid chlorine will cause burning to the eyes and skin. Yet, with the proper equipment and proper handling of this chemical, the hazards can be controlled.\n\nThe prevention program is an essential component of the risk mana"

      "SummaryText": "gement plan. This program covers safety information, a review of potential hazards, operating procedures, employee training, and maintenance of equipment. It is essential to have up-to-date and complete information available on these topics to protect the employees and the surrounding community by eliminating possible hazardous situations. The Municipal Plant #3 keeps current safety data sheets on chlorine available to the staff at all times. There are also equipment specifications and safe upper and lower parameters for the process available in the main building at Plant #2.\n\nProcess hazard analyses (PHA) were conducted by the employees at Plant #3. The purpose of the PHA is to identify all hazards associated with the chemical and the process, opportunities for equipment malfunction or human error, safeguards in place, and detection or monitoring equipment in place or needed. Possible hazards identified include toxic releases, overpressurization of a container, and equipment failure. Safeguards in place to protect against these hazards include vent lines, relief and check valves, manual shutoffs, and an emergency power system. Leak detectors are provided both in the chlorination shed and outside near the one ton containers. They will trigger audible and visible alarms at the chlorination shed and in the operators' room in the main building at Plant #2.\n\nOperating procedures are available to all employees in the manufacturers' instruction manuals, which are located online and in the main office building. These procedures cover normal operations, including start-up and shutdown, of each piece of equipment in the chlorination process. Also, emergency procedures to be carried out in the case of a chlorine leak are posted in the chlorination room. All operators working in the plant have been properly trained on the plant operations and emergency procedures. On-the-job training is conducted continuously to keep employees current on safe handling procedures. Routine maint"

      "SummaryText": "enance of the equipment is conducted each day by trained operators. An outside contractor is brought in if the chlorination equipment requires repair service.\n\nDue to the safety procedures discussed above and the adherence to these procedures by the plant operators, the Municipal Plant #3 has never had an >RQ accidental release. Although it is unlikely that the plant will have an accidental release in the future, emergency response plans are in place in the event one does occur. The Plant has coordinated with the Laurel Fire Department to respond to emergency situations. Therefore, the fire department maintains emergency repair kits and self-contained breathing apparatuses (SCBA's). In the event of a chlorine leak, the Laurel Fire Department has an interlocal agreement with the Hattiesburg Haz-Mat Team to respond. Emergency numbers for the fire department are posted in the chlorination room and in the operator's room. Also, the Plant has been furnished with notices from the Chlorine Handling Institute, Inc. that outline first aid procedures to be carried out during an emergency release. \n\n"
