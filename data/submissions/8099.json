      "SummaryText": "16948 LDEQ Facility ID Number\n\n\nCajun Electric Power Cooperative is committed to safe and environmentally sound operation of the Big Cajun 2 power plant. The Big Cajun 2 power plant is a 3 unit coal-fired power plant located on a 2000-acre site near New Roads, Louisiana on the Mississippi River.  The mission of the power plant is to produce electricity for the 11 electric cooperatives located throughout Louisiana.  The plant burns Wyoming sub-bituminous coal in its boilers, and utilizes Mississippi River water for cooling and boiler make-up water.\n\nThe Big Cajun 2 power plant is dedicated to a safe working environment.  A Corporate Safety Policy was instituted in 1983, and revised in 1992.  A Cajun Safety Manual is provided to each employee of Cajun Electric.  Management incorporates training in safe-handling practices of hazardous materials and in fire-fighting techniques on a regular basis.  The Safety Department provides training in HAZCom,  and Emergency Response Team (ERT) training is also provided.    \n\nChlorine is the only regulated substance utilized at this facility. Chlorine is used in the pretreatment of water, and in cooling towers located onsite.  Chlorine is delivered to the site in one (1) ton cylinders.  Each cylinder is transferred by the delivery driver from the delivery truck and positioned on its side in a Bulk Storage Rack. Two Bulk Storage Racks are located on the site, and each of the Bulk Storage Racks are in well ventilated areas that require minimal exposure to personnel. The chlorine is stored in one ton (2000 pound) cylinders at the following two locations on the site.   \n\nAt the Circulating Water Chlorination Process (cooling towers), the storage rack holds up to twelve 1-ton cylinders.  The function of the Circulating Water Chlorination System is to add chlorine to the Circulating Water System for the purpose of killing potentially harmful water-philous bacteria and fungi (algae), and for preventing \"algae blooms\" that can foul cooling"

Alarms are provided for the Circulating Water Chlorination System.  The alarms include chlorine detected (Chloralert), and pressure and temperature switches in the process which detect and alert emergency personnel.\n\nThe second chlorine storage area is located in the water Pretreatment Chlorination Process.  At the Pretreatment Chlorination Process, the storage rack holds up to four (4) cylinders.  The function of the Pretreatment Chlorination System is to supply chlorine to clarifiers (1,2 and 3) and to the River Water Header.  The chlorine is used to kill or retard the growth of water-philous bacteria and algae.  These contaminants pose health hazards for exposed employees and can foul process components.  At the Pretreatment area, only one (1) chlorine container is in-service at any time.  A visual and audible alarm is located at the Pretreatment Chlorination Process, and this alarm also acknowleges in the Unit 3 Control room.     \n\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe guidance utilized for the worst-case and alternative scenarios was the EPA's RMPComp\u0019.\n\nThe worst case scenario analyzed was the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine in the release duration of ten (10) minutes (200 pounds per minute).  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint would be 1.3 miles, which would extend offsite but would not affect any public receptors.  \n    \nThe alternative release scenario analyzed was the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine in the release duration of sixty (60) minutes (approximately 33 pounds per minute).  The estimated distance to toxic endpoint would be 0.1 miles, which would have no offsite impact.\n\n\nThe Big Cajun 2 power plant complies with the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations of OSHA.  The Big Cajun 2 power plant has an on-site safety training facility, and two full time on-site training personnel.  A part time trai"

Incident Commander training has been conducted, and ERT personnel are on-site 24 hours per day.  Personnel assigned to ERT receive a minimum of 1 hour per month on various safety items, and an 8 hours per year in fire fighting.  A public address system is located throughout the plant site.  An audible alarm sound followed by verbal communication will alert the ERT.  Alarms located at the Circulating Water Chlorination Process, and the Pretreatment Chlorination Process, will alert personnel of a possible chlorine leak.\n\nThe Shift Supervisors at Big Cajun 2 perform as an Incident Commander for emergency response.  Also, the plant has two safety coodinators and an evironmental technician trained in HazCom on workdays."
