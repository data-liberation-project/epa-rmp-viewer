As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of sulfur dioxide.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of an uncontrolled release of sulfur dioxide.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to a sulfur dioxide release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Plan as per 29 CFR 1910.38(a).\n\nThis facility has also coordinated with the local emergency responders and will maintain close contact to ensure that the responders are familiar with the system and with the general safety and accidental release program at our plant.\n\nIt "

      "SummaryText": "is the policy of this facility to devote the time, energy, and capital toward maintaining prevention and response programs appropriate to the inherent dangers with the use of highly (acutely) hazardous chemicals.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nAeris, Inc. is a retail supplier of various compressed gases for industrial, commercial, and medical use.  The company provides sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfurous acid (H2SO3) to wineries, as well as welding gases such as acetylene, argon, and oxygen to its customers.  \n\nThe business is located at 1180 Vendels Circle in Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo County, California, just east of the intersection of State Highways 101 and 46 West.  The facility is situated within a few hundred feet along State Highway 101 on the east side of the highway.\n\nThe company property is bordered by commercial businesses, light industrial facilities, and agricultural land. The facility is located south of the town of Paso Robles and lies at an elevation of approximately 740 feet.  The business lies west of the Salinas River in the Salinas River Valley between the Santa Ysabel and Paso de Robles Mountains. The average annual rainfall for the area is about 13 inches.\n \nAeris, Inc. uses one regulated substance, sulfur dioxide, in two processes.  Sulfur dioxide is purchased from a sulfur dioxide manufacturer and stored and used on-site in 150-lb. cylinders and 2000-lb. cylinders as a gas liquefied under pressure.  The chemical is primarily sold to wineries for use as a preserving agent.\n\nAeris, Inc. maintains up to a maximum of 11,950 pounds of sulfur dioxide stored in 25-lb, 150-lb, and 2,000-lb cylinders on site at any one time.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in three separate systems. It is purchased in 1-ton (2,000-lb), 150-lb, and 25-lb cylinders as a gas liquefied under pressure from a sulfur dioxide manufacturer. The sulfur dioxide may be sold directly to customers for use as a compressed gas without any processing or it may be sold as a sul"

There are two sulfur dioxide systems for production of the sulfurous acid solution, depending upon the size of the vessel required to fill an order (A?Large Vessel FillA? and A?Small Vessel FillA?).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Aeris, Inc. sulfur dioxide processes have many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation.  \n\nIn addition, Aeris, Inc. has developed a preventive maintenance program in which each cylinder is inspected upon delivery. All other cylinder maintenance is performed by the chemical supply vendor. Each cylinder is equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpressurization.\n\nThe dewars are equipped with check valves to prevent contamination of the sulfur dioxide. The vent line on the dewarsA? safety relief valve is routed to an open water- filled barrel which is located outside the building.\n\nThe process building is ventilated using an exhaust fan at the wall and portable fans. The large roll-up door and man door at opposite ends of the building are typically open and ventilate the process area.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nThe Aeris, Inc. facility has an emergency response plan in effect.  The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM/RMP/CalARP document, which is maintained at the facility:\n\n  1.) To save lives.\n  2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n  3.) To protect the environment.\n  4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, sulfur dioxide health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that ma"

This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM / CalARP regulations.\n\nAeris, Inc.  personnel circulate throughout the storage facility, taking note of unusual conditions.  In the event that a sulfur dioxide leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger and the Aeris, Inc. Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. Emergency agencies will also be notified as necessary as outlined in the Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no significant releases of sulfur dioxide over the past five years (May 2004 A? May 2009) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 500 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an sulfur dioxide release, nor any releases or A?near missesA? that warranted an internal incident investigation.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis, including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a facility inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the Aeris, Inc. facility located at 1180 Vendels Circle in Paso Robles, California. The Aeris, Inc. safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility safety plan/programs.\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in safety plan development.\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
