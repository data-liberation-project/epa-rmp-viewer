In order to accomplish these goals the Collier County team works to ensure that all preventative and mitigation steps are taken so that customers and residents surrounding the South Regional Water Treatment Plant are safe.  Collier County also has a strong relationship with the first response agencies and has them conduct regular exercises on site to ensure that should there ever be an event that they are familiar with our facility.\n\nRegulated Substances\nThe primary activity at the South Regional Water Treatment Plant is to treat raw water to meet all potable drinking water standards.  Chlorine is the only 40 CFR 68 regulated substance at the facility.  Chlorine is used primarily as a disinfectant.  The maximum amount of chlorine at the facility at a time is 30 tons.\n\nAccidential Release Prevention Program\nCollier County is in compliance with 40 CFR 68.  The County has conducted a comprehensive review of the chlorine system as well as admnistrative, technical, operating and maintenance procedures.  The County has both passive mitigation, an enclosed building; and active mitigation, an emergency scrubber to minimize the consequences of an accidential release.  \n\nEmergency Response Plan\nThe SCRWTP has an emergency response program that is coordinated with the Collier County Comprehensive Emergency Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that has been prepared in accordance with all local, state, and federal regulations.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis Updates\nIn the 1999 submittal, there were a number of items that still needed to be accomplished that were identified in the Process Hazard Analysis.
