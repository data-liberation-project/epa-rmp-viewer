Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.    In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Fire Department and the County Disaster Services Coordinator to assist in the response. Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\r\n\r\n5.Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\n6.Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThis facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance. Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a). Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\r\n\r\n7.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nFreezer Services of Michigan expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of a PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the hazard review were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Freezer Services expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nFreezer Services of Michigan, LLC recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility. The Freezer Services PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program. The Freezer Services PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed. Freezer Services believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program. Operating level employees, particularly the Chief Refrigeration Engineer and the Refrigeration System Operator, have been deeply involved and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Hamtramck Michigan facility safely. The Freezer Services Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Hamtramck Fire Department. All Freezer Services employees have received documented emergency response training.\r\n\r\n2.Facility and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nFreezer Services, based in Hamtramck, MI stores frozen foods and vegetables obtained from multiple growing sites. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Freezer Services of Michigan has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur. \r\n\r\n3.Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available fo"
