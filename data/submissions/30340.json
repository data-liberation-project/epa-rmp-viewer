If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.\tFacility Information. \n\n \n\u00b7\tThe facility stores anhydrous ammonia as a fertilizer for sale to farmer customers\n\u00b7\tAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\u00b7\tThe maximum quantity stored would be 411,240 pounds.  Stored in eight 11,000 gallon tanks.\n\u00b7\t\n\n3.\tThe Worst-case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario\n\na)\tThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 51,405 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .79 miles.\nb)\tThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a pipe leak.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41miles.\n\n4.\tThe accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \u00bfSafety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-611.1\u00bf published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). 29 CFR 1910.111, \u00bfstorage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\u00bf\n\n5.\tThe Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\na)\thave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\nb)\tTo our knowledge have resulted in offsite"

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  Self closing break-a-ways have been installed at each of the risers to prevent a release in the evet that a nurse tank was left attached when leaving the location after filling.  The hose would break from the riser and both ends would close preventing any releases of ammonia.\n\nAdditionally,  the total storage volume at the site has been reduced by 90,000 gallons (420,588 pounds).\n\nThere are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation beyond these changes."
