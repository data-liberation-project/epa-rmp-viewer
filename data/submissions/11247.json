It is the policy of Tom's Foods Inc. to also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is Tom's policy to immediately notify the Karns Volunteer Fire Department by telephone at 423-691-1212.  The fire department is familar with our facility and has access after hours.\n\nThis facility is a snack food manufacturing plant producing salted snacks such as potato and corn chips.  Propane is used as a standby fuel in the event that the natural gas supply is curtailed.  The system consist of a 30,000 gallon above ground storage tank (AST), associated piping, pumps, water bath vaporizer and delivery piping which is connected into the main gas line which serves the plant.\n\nTom's worst case scenario is the failure of the 30,000 gallon tank when filled to the greatest allowed capacity (85%) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to endpoint of this event is .4 miles (.6 kilometers).  There area an estimated 25 people who live within this distance.  Karns high school and vocational school are within the calculated enpoint of the worst case scenario but are not within the enpoint of the alternative case scenario which is calculated at .1 miles (0.16 kilometers).\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule as well as all applicable state and local codes.  This facility is inspected by Protection Mutual insurance, the Knox County Air Pollution Board, OSHA as well as internal safety committee and a corporate safety manager.\n\nTom's Foods has never had an accident involving propane that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations or environmental damage."
