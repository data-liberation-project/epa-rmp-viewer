At the time of this submittal:  a. Limetree's business plan includes operation of terminal assets (tanks and docks), the wastewater treatment unit, the power generation units, and the local sales rack (truck loading rack), b. is introducing the ship unloading, storage and blending of Butane as gasoline component.\n\nThere are two covered propane processes at the Facility. Unit 3316 is the propane storage area for the facility.  Propane is currently stored in four pressurized spheres.  Unit 1651 is a wholesale truck rack used to distribute petroleum products (several grades of gasoline, diesel, jet, and propane) to the local market.  Unit 1651 also contains four pressurized propane bullets.\n\nUnit 3316 contains butane storage spheres; however these spheres are not in service at this time. The Butane handling (ship offloading, storage and blending operation into gasoline) will commence before the end of the second quarter of 2017. \n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nOne worst-case scenario involving flammable substances was identified. The worst case scenario is a failure of the west Butane storage sphere containing approximately 4,370,000 pounds of liquid Butane resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The release was modeled assuming that the entire vessel's content was released over a ten minute period.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences, no administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios. Under certain circumstances, these scenarios could reach offsite public receptors. The vapor cloud explo"

The area beyond Limetree's property that would be affected by the worst-case scenario include commercial and industrial-zoned land, property owned by the Government of the United States Virgin Islands, land for recreational use, residential land (approximately 2,500 housing units) and a school with an approximate population of 2,500.\n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nOne alternative release scenario involving flammable substances was identified. The alternate scenario considered is a pin hole leak of ? inch in the butane tank or pump line suction over a period of one hour, resulting in 4,700 pound of butane. The vapor cloud explosion was performed utilizing EPA ALOHA model.  Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage the consequences, no administrative controls (including release prevention measures) or passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating these scenarios. This release scenario did not result in any offsite consequences on public receptors.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nLimetree is committed to protecting its employees, public safety and the surrounding environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training employees and implementing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of its processes. Limetree's policy is to protect the community and its workers from potential accidental releases of chemical substances and to reduce the extent and impact of a release. However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained to respond, control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Limetree Oil Storage Facility, located on the south shore of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, is in a predominantly industrial/commercial area.  The Facility provides routine employment for approximately 100 Limetree "

The Facility has two regulated flammables: propane and Butane.  Butane will begin being handled at the facility before the end of the second quarter of 2017.  No toxic material is stored here.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Limetree. Facilities at the storage terminal, which are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule, are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLimetree maintains a variety of technical documents used to ensure safe operation of each process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Documents are maintained in the Facility's LiveLink system and are accessible by all employees. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS) and HAZCOM lists. The Facility ensures that each process is maintained within acceptable operating limits, by using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automatic shutdown systems). \n\nThe Facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of each process equipment. These documents are accessible electronically through the LiveLink system. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature ratings, area electrical classification, etc. This information, in "

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage such hazards.\n\nLimetree primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, \"What-If\", or Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) checklist technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, technical, maintenance, safety and engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates process hazards along with accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nResolution implementation of mitigation options, in response to PHA findings, is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This risk ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the PHA is updated and revalidated at least every 5 years. The results and findings, as well as resolutions of these findings, are documented and retained the results, findings and resolutions of the PHA findings are reviewed with appropriate employees/contractors.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nLimetree maintains written procedures.

These procedures are certified annually, or as often as necessary to ensure that they are current and accurate.\n\nIn addition, Limetree maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to abnormal operating conditions. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nLimetree requires employees to participate in all facets of their PSM and accident prevention program.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents, developing operating procedures and chemical information, and participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Facility and addresses each accident prevention program element.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Limetree maintains a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New operators receive basic training in facility. After successfully completing such training, a new operator is paired with a senior certified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. When operators demonstrate proficient knowledge (e.g., through knowledge tests and performance tests) to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are certified to operate the corresponding unit independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training (re-certification) on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

All operators training are documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nLimetree uses Contractors to supplement its work force.  Some Contractors work on or near process equipment, therefore the Facility: (1) informs contractors of hazards known to the Facility which are related to the Contractor's work and the processes in the area of such work; (2) makes sure that the Contractor understands what to do in the event of an emergency; (3) develops and implements safe work practices, such as permit systems, to control Contractor entrance, presence and exit from the process areas; (4) provides the Contractor with site safety rules and applicable safe operating practice procedures; and (5) requires that Contractors inform site safety personnel of hazards they encounter. This is accomplished by providing Contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, Limetree evaluates Contractor safety programs and performance as a part of the Contractor selection process.  Also, Facility personnel periodically monitor and evaluate Contractor performance to verify that Contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations once onsite.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nLimetree conducts a PSSR for any unit or Facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to confirm construction on equipment modifications are in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspec"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLimetree has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training; (2) developing written procedures; (3) performing inspections/tests and documenting results; (4) preventive maintenance; (5) correcting identified deficiencies; and (6) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on: (1) an overview of the process; (2) safety and health hazards; (3) applicable maintenance procedures; (4) emergency response plans; and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable operating limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service, or a Management of Change (MOC) team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nQuality assurance is another integral part of the mechanical integrity program.  Limetree incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs by following site engineering and industry standards. \n\nHot Work Permit\n\nLimetree issues hot work permits for"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA studies. At a minimum, all reports include the date of the incident, date the investigation began, description of the incident, factors that contributed to the incident and recommendations resulting from the investigation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Limetree conducts a PSM audit, at least every three years, to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed and the final resolution of each finding is documented. The two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The Program 3 prevention program requirements are applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Facility.  Program 3 incorporates the most rigorous program requirements for release prevention.  \n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, Limetree has general safety features on all process units to help prevent a release, contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and/or, reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of general safety features are used in various processes:\n\n?    Release Detection\n\n-    Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n-    Release Prevention/Containment/Control\n\n-    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automatic)\n\n-    Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\n\n"

All work permits are kept on file until the completion of the hot work. \n\nManagement of Change\n\nLimetree has a comprehensive system, including written procedures, to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process-operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to: (1) identify the technical basis for the proposed change; (2) ensure that adequate controls are in place; (3) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change; (4) review and address potential impacts on employee safety and health; and (5) Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with the necessary training regarding the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nLimetree promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or a personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.
