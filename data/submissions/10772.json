Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Coastal States Crude Gathering Company's Origin Station are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  However, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel will be available to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We have also coordinated with the Corpus Christi Fire Department to provide additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass a Petroleum Storage and Pipeline Pump Station.  We have eight regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Methane, Ethane, Propane, Propylene [1-Propene], Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], and Pentane.  The regulated substances at our facility are components of the Propane, Propylene, Butane, Liquified Petroleum Gases (LPG), and Gasoline products stored and transported by pipeline. \n\nThe maximum inventory of regulated substances at our facility is:\n\nMethane                       3,800 lb\nEthane                     22,000 lb\nPropane                1,400,000 lb\nPropylene [1-Propene]           310,000 lb\nIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl]           230,000 lb\nButane                   510,000 lb\nIsopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-]       250,000 lb\nPentane                   220,000 lb\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": "ce analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 flammable substances involves a catastrophic release from the Station Operations.  In this scenario, 339,095 lb of a flammable mixture containing Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl], and Pentane, is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 85% of the maximum capacity of the source by a system of administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.56 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 flammable substances involves a release from the Station Operations, which is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 1,507.00 lb. of Propane in 0.5 minute.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.06 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (40 CFR part 68).  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nSafety Information\nOrigin Station maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nHazard Review\nOrigin Station conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our proce"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least once every five years.
