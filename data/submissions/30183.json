Copies of emergency \nresponse, process hazard analyses and process safety management plans and all \ntechnical drawing (P&IDs) for process equipment are maintained onsite for reference.  \nRegular inspection and testing of systems in isobutane service are performed to ensure \nequipment integrity is maintained.

      "SummaryText": "*\tBoiler - Heat Input \n*\tTurbine - Work Output \n*\tCondenser - Heat Rejection\n\n \n\nThe Rankine cycle consists of pressurizing a liquid (isobutane), vaporizing the high \npressure liquid, expanding the high pressure vapor and condensing the low pressure \nvapor for reuse.  The energy necessary for the vaporization is provided by geothermal \nbrine at a maximum temperature of 340\u00f8F.  The geothermal energy is transferred to the \nIsobutane working fluid via tube and counter-current shell heat exchangers.  The MPLP \nfacilities use commercial isobutane with a dry cooling heat rejection system.\nThe binary working fluid is Isobutane, a flammable vapor/liquid.  The Isobutane is \npresent on-site at each facility is in various states including high pressure liquid, high \npressure superheated vapor, low pressure liquid and low pressure superheated vapor as \nwould be typical of a power generation process.  \nThe expansion of isobutane occurs in single stage radial turbo-expanders.  The \ncondensing system utilizes ambient air to cool the Isobutane in fin-fan style induced draft \nheat exchangers.  A pressurized liquid accumulator vessel receives the cooled vapor \nand maintains the liquid inventory under pressure.\nPrimary Activities\nGeothermal energy is converted to electric power.  The facility is rated at 40MW.  The \nnet power output to the electrical grid is 18 - 34 MW.  Power output is reduced in warm \nweather due to limitations of the air cooled heat exchangers.\nUse of regulated substance\nIsobutane, a flammable vapor/liquid is used as a binary working fluid. Liquid isobutane is \npumped from a condenser to shell and tube heat exchangers.  Thermal energy provided \nby geothermal brine is transferred to the isobutane.  The geothermal heat input causes \nthe isobutane state to change from liquid to high pressure superheated vapor that is \npassed through turbines to produce electric power.  The vapor is condensed and \nrecycled back to a pressurized liquid accumulator vessel to complete t"
