The unit uses low pressure (<90 psi).  Urea is imported via pipeline as the raw material.  Ammonia is used and produced as a by-product in both processes.  The regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities present are:\n\tAmmonia (Anhydrous):\t15,630 lbs in M-I  low pressure process.\n\n\nWorst Case Release Scenarios \u00bf Ammonia\nA total failure or rupture of the ammonia storage drum in the M-I process could cause the release of the drum content and ammonia from connected vessels.  This release is calculated at 15,630 pounds of ammonia.  In this particular release, the endpoint of the release is 2.13 miles.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \u00bf Ammonia \nIn this scenario, the assumption was made that facility personnel would not be able to stop a release from the Ammonia Drum due to a small crack in the vessel.  Under normal operating conditions, the drum is never kept full, typically holding about 2000 pounds of ammonia.  Based upon this volume with a crack area of 0.25 inches, the total release en"

MCI\u00bfs safety and environmental record reflects this commitment.  The following is a summary of the multiple layers of safety and environmental protection that MCI has in place at our plant to protect our employees and the community:\n- Managing risks in something we do on a daily basis.\n-  We have worked for many years to reduce risks at our site and to be prepared for emergencies.\n-  Our employees are highly skilled and well trained.\n-  Our equipment is routinely (number of times per year) inspected and tested to make sure it is safe.\n-  We have computer monitors and controls throughout our plants to detect potential leaks or releases before they occur.\n-  Hazard reviews are done for all changes.  They involve \u00bfwhat if\u00bf scenarios where employee teams investigate every possible scenario of a new project and resolve it as part of the design phase of the project.\n- Emergency response, includes employee responders as well as off-site responders like LEPC, State Police and HAZMAT.\n-  We work closely with the police and fire departments, and we conduct routine drills.\n-  In the event of an emergency, we are prepared to respond.\n\nMCI has not had any accidental releases, as defined by the Risk Management Program regulations, for the last 5 years.  The release that MCI has had in the past 5 years are typically very small release in nature to the air and do not meet the criteria that is stipulated in the regulations.\n\nMCI has an extensive emergency response program both within the facility and within the community.  Within the facility there is a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  The ERP is designed as a guide to help in determining the magnitude of an incident, the steps needed to bring the incident under control and the requirements to ensure that all the federal, state, and local laws are complied with.

The plan has detailed action plans that specifically address incidents concerning chemical spills, fire, acts of nature, civil strife, area risks from outside the facility, personnel injury or fatality, and equipment failures.  The plan also designates the type and frequency of training that each person is required to have depending on their responsibilities.  Furthermore, the plan commits the management team to devote the necessary resources to prepare, implement and audit the ERP.\n\nAlthough the ERP is specifically written for the MCI facility the plan is also part of the parish wide emergency response plan organized with the local LEPC.  All these plans are reviewed with representatives of the LEPC, State Police, Sheriff Department, Fire Departments, regulatory agencies and industry.\n\nMCI is striving on a daily basis to try and make the facility as safe as possible for the employees, contractors and the community.  MCI literally has safety and or environmental training going on almost daily, every employee and contractor will attend several safety and/or environmental training meeting annually.  MCI and its employees have an enduring commitment to protecting health, safety and the environment and our success is accomplished by research, innovation and the use of good common sense."
