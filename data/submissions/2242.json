Warren County is located just south of the center of the western edge of the Cumberland Plateau.  The water plant chemical building is located 941 feet above sea level.  The city is encircled on two sides by mountains, Ben Lomand and Harrison Ferry, that rise to approximately 1,200 feet above the city.\nB.  The McMinnville Water Plant's Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Division of Water PWSID# is 0000423.  We are rated as a 5 MGD plant.  Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection of water taken from the Barren Fork of the Collins River.  We maintain a residual of .5+ mg/L throughout the distribution system.  We serve 6,000 water taps.  McMinnville's population is 12,000 persons.\nC.  The plant's maximum inventory of chlorine gas is four one ton cylinders (possibly 8,000 lbs.).  Chlorine gas is kept in our chemical building in a separate containment room that is constructed of concrete supports, block with brick facing.  The room is kept free from any potential fire hazzards.\nD.  The cylinder containment room and the chlorinator room are both continuously monitored for possible leaks of 1 ppm and above by Wallace & Tiernans Acutec 35 wall mounted chlorine detectors.  The detector has an alarm that sounds and warning lamps that are mounted by the delivery doors, easily visible from office building.  The chlorinator room is equipped with three Wallace & Tiernan Series V-2000 Chlorinators.  Our chlorine room is visably checked every two hours while plant is in operation.  The plant averages 20 hours operation time each day.  Making securing the chlorine area during down time is absolutely necessary.\nE.  The water plant has used one ton chlorine cylinders since 1962.  Precaution is taken to follow all safety rules in all phases of set up and operation.  Safety standards are followed.\nF.  The offsite consequenc"

The \"Worse Case Release Scenario\" was modeled from EPA's RMP Guidance Exhibit 4-3.  2,000 lbs. of chlorine gas is lost in 10 minutes, F Stability, wind speed 1.5 meters, urban distance to toixc endpoint 1.3 miles radius, approximate population 5,900 persons (U.S. Census Tract/Block Map).\nG.  The \"Alternative Release Scenario\" was adapted using EPA's RMP Guidance Exhibit 4-15.  A 1 inch diameter piping hole has a release rate of 150 lbs. per minute.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.2 miles for the urban area.  The population using U.S. Census Tract/Block map is 300 persons.\nH.  The McMinnville Water Plant is studying and evaluating safer alternatives to chlorine gas."
