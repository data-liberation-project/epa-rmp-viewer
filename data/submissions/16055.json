This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Bromine..  Chlorine is used in the ion displacement process.  Chloride ions are used to displace bromide ions in the raw brine.  Elemental bromine is precipitated.  Bromine is reacted with hydrogen to form hydrogen bromide.  The hydrogen bromide is then further reacted with calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide to form calcium or sodium bromide.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 180,000.00 lb. while Bromine is present at our facility in a quantity of 100,000.00 lb.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations and PHAST 5.1.  For alternative release scenario analyses we have employed PHAST.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 19 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 3 ppm.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a release from a tank car unloading hose..  The scenario involves the release of 19740 lb. of chlorine gas over a period of 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of  3 ppm of Chlorine is 6 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Bromine involves a release from BROMINE.  The scenario involves the release of 35240 lb. of liquid bromine.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a  pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as a dike and enclosure are utilized. The release is also assumed to be controlled by a scrubber.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 1 ppm of Bromine is 0.5 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nTHE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of  5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 03/01/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTHE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTHE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY- LUDINGTON PLANT carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.
