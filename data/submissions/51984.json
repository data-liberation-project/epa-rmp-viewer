The SCC has contracted the Southwest Water Company (SWWC), a private company, to operate the SWTP.\n\nThe SCC and SWWC has reviewed its obligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112 of the Clean Air Act) and determined that the facility has a quantity of chlorine that exceeds the RMP threshold. In response to these requirements, the SCC and SWWC note the following obligations incumbent on the operations at the SWTP:\n\n(1) 112 (1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause \u00bf The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. The SCC and SWWC take this obligation seriously, and intend to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in the community safety and emergency preparedness. \n\n(2) Risk Management Plan \u00bf SWWC operates the SWTP which stores and uses chlorine in excess of the threshold specified in the RMP Rule. SWWC has developed, and is in the process of further developing and implementing, programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release. These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\nBackground - Chlorine is used in the treatment process at the South Water Treatment Plant as a disinfectant. Chlorine is delivered as a compressed liquid in one ton cylinders. There is storage capacity on site to accommodate 10 cylinders or 20,000 pounds at any given time. As required by the RMP Rule, SWWC has considered the impact of a sudden release of the entire content of one cylinder within a ten-minute period of time. SWWC also considered the impact of a more likely release. Key elements from these two release scenarios ar"
