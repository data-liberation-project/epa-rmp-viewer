CordenPharma Colorado (CPC) has evaluated the requirements of the RMP rule and has reviewed present emergency management practices.  CordenPharma Colorado has determined that current practices meet or exceed the requirements of RMP. \r\n\r\nCordenPharma Colorado has an extensive process safety management program designed to satisfy all of Occupational Safety & Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management program requirements and the RMP.  CPC is dedicated to working with the community emergency response authorities to address the potential for releases that could affect the public.  CPC employs physical and administrative controls to mitigate potential releases.  CPC implements extensive internal training to prevent releases as well as prepare for eventualities which may result from releases.  CPC is an active member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and endeavors to prepare the LEPC for the possibility of responding to releases that could originate from CPC. \r\n\r\n2.0 PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nCPC has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 that exceeds the plan threshold, piperidine.  Piperidine is used in the production of pharmaceutical intermediates, and in performing research and development of new and/or improved pharmaceutical processes.  Specifically, CPC uses Piperidine in the production of pharmaceuticals that combat HIV/AIDs, irritable bowel syndrome, and diabetes. Pharmaceuticals are primarily produced via synthesis routes involving organic chemicals.    \r\n\r\nThe piperidine threshold in 40 CFR 68 is 15,000 pounds. Piperidine is transferred from a tanker truck to a storage tank, each having maximum capacities of 46,200 pounds and 38,000 pounds, respec"

Piperidine is utilized in the manufacturing process and is ultimately disposed of as hazardous waste.  \r\nPiperidine has associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public in the event of a large spill.  The worst case scenario and alternative release scenarios are described below per 40 CFR 68.\r\n\r\nPiperidine is a chemical with a pungent odor that is readily detectable below concentrations of concern.  The odor is described in literature as amine-like, heavy, sweet, floral, animal odor, or pepper-like, but always unpleasant.  Due to the odor, exposed persons will not voluntarily stay in areas of even low concentrations.  Little data regarding exposure limits is available in the literature, however CordenPharma Colorado has been advised by expert toxicologists to consider the following concentrations for emergency response planning purposes:\r\n\t\r\n\t1 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration for up to one hour without experiencing other than mild, transient adverse health effects or without perceiving a clearly defined objectionable odor. \r\n\r\n\t10-100 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\r\n\r\n\t100-1000 ppm: It is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed up to this airborne concentration range for up to one hour without experiencing or developing life threatening health effects.\r\n\r\nConcentrations of 100 ppm, 10 ppm, and 6 ppm were used to evaluate the toxic threat zones and impacts of site releases using the ALOHA release modeling software.

Anticipated health effects are acute irritation/toxicity including skin irritation, corrosive effect on human tissue, nausea.  In the next section is a description of the release scenarios for piperidine and their off-site consequences:\r\n\r\n2.1 WORST-CASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nA worst-case scenario has been developed for CPC. The largest piperidine inventory that is present at CPC, is held within tanker trucks delivering loads of piperidine. These tankers hold up to 46,200 pounds of material. Tanker trucks drive through areas of the site not within secondary containment before reaching their unloading areas. The worst case scenario is complete loss of material from a tanker to an area not within secondary containment. The spilled piperidine is then expected to evaporate and form vapor clouds, that would reach off site receptors.\r\n\r\nPassive controls are not applicable to this scenario, due to the assumption that the tanker has no secondary containment.  The worst case release would be an unconfined, outdoor spill of 46,200 pounds of Piperidine with no secondary containment. Liquid piperidine is then subject to evaporation that may create a vapor cloud that would reach off-site receptors per EPA distance-to-endpoint factors. \r\n\r\n2.2 ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is a complete piperidine release from a delivery tank truck within the unloading area. Tank truck deliveries will be in amounts up to 46,200 pounds. Deliveries are received on a concrete containment pad that slopes down toward a manually operated sump pump. The containment pad has a surface area of approximately 416 square feet. The concrete pad qualifies as passive control.  The sump pump pumps liquid from the tanker containment pad to the diked area around the 081 Piperidine storage tank. The diked area around the storage tank is capable of holding the entire volume of the tanker. E"

      "SummaryText": "mployees will be observing tanker unloading, and in the case of a spill will start the sump pump to move liquid into the diked area. Active mitigation of the release is human intervention, including use of the sump pump. A conservative approach was used in the modeling of this scenario, using the entire surface area of the tanker unloading pad, as well as the diked area for the surface area of the evaporating pool of piperidine, which totals approximately 750 square feet.  The alternative release scenario distance-to-endpoint will reach off-site receptors; however, no residential population resides in this area. \r\n\r\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nCPC complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The EPA has said that a process in compliance with OSHA PSM is also in compliance with RMP program level 3.  The process containing piperidine at CPC is RMP program level 3.  All elements of OSHA PSM have been implemented for the piperidine containing process.\r\n\r\nKey aspects of the PSM program include: process safety information and updates, process hazard analysis, operating procedure documentation and review, class room and on-hands training prior to system operation, mechanical integrity program, management of change programs, pre-startup reviews, incident investigation, routine compliance audits, special work permit programs, contractor management and qualification, and employee participation in process safety reviews.\r\n\r\n4.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidents involving RMP regulated chemicals in the last five years that have affected offsite receptors or have resulted in significant loss of property or injury of personnel.\r\n\r\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nCordenPharma Colorado has a comprehensive emergency response plan that addresses employee, contractor and public safety.
