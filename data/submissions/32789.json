These regulations deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall facility, employee and public safety.  John Morrell  & Co. (Springdale)?s programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall these programs are in place to prevent potential accidental injury, illness, death and to avoid the potential for damage to property and the environment.\n\nJohn Morrell  & Co. (Springdale)?s safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals.  Any group of vessels interconnected or separate vessels, which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\n\nJohn Morrell  & Co. (Springdale)?s safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and revised as necessary.  All information is communicated to all employees of John Morrell  & Co. (Springdale) through training and documentation.\n\nJohn Morrell  & Co. (Springdale) is a pork processing and packaging company, which utilizes approximately 32,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility?s production and shipping areas and 130,000 pounds of propane"

(Springdale)?s accidental release prevention programs on safe work practices as referenced.  Key elements of this prevention program are comprised of:\n\nEquipment design, installation and operation of ammonia process systems Emergency Response and Action Plan Program (OSHA 29CFR 1910.120, 1910.38, and EPA 40CFR Part 68.) Mechanical Integrity, Emergency Shut-down Procedures, and Inspection Program (OSHA 29CFR 1910.119)\n\nJohn Morrell  & Co. (Springdale) experienced one accidental release of ammonia in 2000.  The release consisted of approximately 3000 pounds of ammonia being released from a pipeline when a forklift hit it.  The incident resulted in no injuries and no damage to persons or property off-site.  \nThe facility emergency response program is based on OSHA?s Regulations for Emergency Action Plans (1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29CFR1910.120).  John Morrell  & Co. (Springdale) has an on-site trained emergency response team (HAZMAT) and maintains a written emergency response plan, which is reviewed annually.  \n\nThrough Process Hazard Analysis, inspections, annual reviews, and audits, John Morrell  & Co. (Springdale) continuously improves it?s process system, procedures, programs, and training to ensure mitigation, control, technology, equipment, and organizational changes remain consistent and in force.  Through this initiative, John Morrell  & Co. (Springdale) can ensure the utmost safeguards are utilized as it relates to it?s process system and programs for the overall safety and well being of the employees, facility, and the environment."
