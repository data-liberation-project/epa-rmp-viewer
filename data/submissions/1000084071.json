The facility processes and stores vegetables using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations. The plant has been operating safely since 1986, with many upgrades made to the facility, the last upgrade in 2013 replaced older cold storage units.\n\n\n\nThe plant has two separate and distinct refrigeration systems; they are in separate buildings and have no interconnection. Only one, the processing system (Engine Room #1), exceeds the threshold amount for anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, only the processing system is covered in the facility Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program  \n\nTwin City Foods implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard 29 CFR 1910.119(MIOSHA 408.19102), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of certain chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has many built-in safety features including high-level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutdowns, and leak detectors.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPer the "

There have been no such accidents at this facility in the past five years. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Planning\n\nThe facility maintains a written emergency action plan per 29 CFR 1910.38(MIOSHA 408.19103)to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an emergency.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, and orderly evacuation of the facility. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process; safety meetings; employee suggestions; accident, incident and near-miss investigations; and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order.\n\n"
