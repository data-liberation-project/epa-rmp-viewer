The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are communicated to employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Valero Benicia\nRefinery periodically conducts audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by\nthe accident prevention program are being implemented. Independent, 3rd party compliance audits\nare conducted at least every 3 years. The audit teams develop findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.

The Valero Benicia Refinery has a long-standing commitment to employee and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery, located in Benicia, California, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc. In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (>20%), which are toxic regulated substances. The Refinery contains multiple Program Level 3 covered processes for the purposes of this plan. \n\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS\n\nThe refinery is subject to external events, which may cause the release of hazardous materials. The refinery is designed and operated in such a way as to minimize the probability and the impact of such events. External events considered in the design and operation of the refinery include, but are not limited to: security, temperature extremes, earthquake, winds, precipitation, utility disruption, and wildland fires. Of particular interest is the earthquake susceptibility. The refinery was built in the late 1960's to the best ground motion tec"

Additions and significant modifications to the Refinery since that time have been done using the codes and technology  applicable at the time of construction of those projects. Even prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, the refinery had conducted independent assessments of risks associated with lateral ground motion. Although there would likely be damage to refinery equipment should a worst credible earthquake occur, studies have indicated that catastrophic loss of containment would be of minimal concern.\n With the advent of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, the refinery has completed detailed evaluations of its physical security facilities and associated security plans. Both have been significantly updated to address issues identified in these evaluations, and they meet all federal requirements for marine and fuels terminals. In addition, the refinery has maintained strong links with local and national law enforcement agencies to ensure good coordination in the event of an incident. In order to be vigilant, the refinery also conducts routine inspections of its security systems and works with the United States Coast Guard to minimize the likelihood of such attacks at the facility.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Valero Benicia Refinery. EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements are met because all Program Level 3 processes at the refinery are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard. The refinery is  focused on fuels production and most of the light hydrocarbons are used in mixtures and are not recovered as pure components. Isomers and olefins of propane and butane origin are mixed without regard to the specific components, because they all behave similarly in their use as fuel. Where there"

If these data were not readily available, only the normal paraffinic component (propane, butane) is listed. In all cases, the normal paraffinic component is less dense but has a higher energy value than the olefins or isomers, and therefore, represents a more conservative case. Additional details are included in the Data Element section of this RMPlan. Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing. August 1, 2024 was selected as the back-end date for the collection of information required for the 2024 resubmission. \n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to the information used to create the refinery accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of safety committees and forums that employees can use to address any potential process and personnel safety issues. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. The refinery is currently working to regain the California OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star status. The refinery plans to submit its application for STAR status in 2025.

The refinery has implemented a behavior-based safety program called Valero Safety Excellence Program (VSEP). The purpose of this program is to reduce at-risk behaviors and remove barriers to safe behaviors, thus improving safety performance. Peer observations are anonymous and confidential. The VSEP observers strive to be safety role models supporting continuous improvement processes at Valero Benicia Refinery.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the PSM documentation to help employees locate any necessary process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). For specific process areas, the refinery has identified operating envelopes; i.e. documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrumented systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems, alarm systems). The refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery primarily uses the guideword-based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study methodology. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated. This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed with local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by the PHA team. The evaluation helps to ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater risk receive attention first. Some mitigation options, though, may involve process modifications that can only be implemented during a complete shutdown of the covered process. Implementation of such modifications may extend well into the future and are subject to change. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The resolution of each finding"
