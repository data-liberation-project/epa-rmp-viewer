In order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 71,725 pounds of ammonia in its three independent ammonia refrigeration systems.  The three ammonia refrigeration systems are located in Engine Room #1 & #2, Engine Room #3, and Engine Room #4, each containing the following charge of ammonia: 38,600 pounds, 14,325 pounds, and 18,800 pounds, respectively.  The ammonia refrigeration systems use ammonia for dock operations, warehouse cold storage, and freezer storage.  The majority of the system is located in the machine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DOT Foods, Inc. facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine rooms as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine rooms roof (condensers).\n\nThere are ammonia and temperature sensors placed in the engine rooms (#1 & #2, #3, and #4), freezer, cooler, and dock areas.  In the event of ammonia detection, a facility alarm sounds and a visible alarm is triggered.\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, in particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\"\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the DOT Foods, Inc. ?

The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n? To save lives.\n? To minimize and avoid injuries.\n? To protect the environment.\n? To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The facility maintains a safety committee (a trained Emergency Response team) whose members are designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The emergency response team is trained to call 9-1-1 in an event of an ammonia release.  The 9-1-1 operator will contact the Mt. Sterling Fire Department.  \n\nEmployees within the building are evacuated to a point upwind of the facility or shelter in place.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) performed in 10/26/2004-10/28/2004 for Engine Room #1 & #2, 4/3/2006-4/4/2006 for Engine Room #3, and 7/16/2007-7/19/2007 for Engine Room #4, generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the DOT Foods, Inc. facility located at 1 Dot Way, Mt.
