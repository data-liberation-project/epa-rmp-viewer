The total charge for the refrigeration system is approximately 15,000 LBS.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.  Material Safety Data Sheet for Anhydrous Ammonia is included in RMP.\n\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTaylor Farms Retail Services maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.  There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release.  A Risk Management Program, which includes accident prevention procedures for the ammonia refrigeration system, is maintained on-site along with the RMP. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release.  Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms.  Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day. All relief valves at the facility are tied into ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high pressure releases to ambient.\n\n4.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response proced"

Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\n\nTaylor Farm Retail Services facility has fixed and portable refrigeration system onsite. Fixed system is composed of pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, plate frame heat exchangers,fall in film water chiller evaporative cooling coils, and diffusion tank. Facility also leases high side refrigeration trailer and vacuum tubes from Western Precooling Systems Inc. Refrigeration trailers contain screw compressors, vessels, vacuum tube coils, and evaporative condensers. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All the pressure vessels and the compressors are protected by safety relief valves against high pressure situations.  There is are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and the mechanical room for alarming. There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\n2.\tDescription of Source and Substance Handled\n\nAmmonia refrigeration system is used for produce precooling, storage and process room cooling and water chilling operations. The facility was built in 2004 and operated by a different company. Taylor Farms Retail Servi"
