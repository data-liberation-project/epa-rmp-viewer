      "SummaryText": "\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued regulation 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, to prevent or minimize the consequence of a catastrophic release of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. The regulation requires a written plan to effectively communicate the hazards posed by processes involving hazardous chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe PSM regulations apply to any chemicals held in larger quantities than the threshold quantities identified in the regulations. The Joint Regional Sewerage Board (JRSB), which is comprised of the Town of Haverstraw and Villages of West Haverstraw and Haverstraw, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) proposes to use chlorine gas in their processes in larger amounts than the threshold quantities of 1,500 lbs. for a Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) and 2,500 lbs. for a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \n\n\n\nA PSMP addressing certain issues is required under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSMP must include the following topics:\n\n\n\n?    employee participation\n\n?    process safety information\n\n?    process hazard analysis\n\n?    operating procedures\n\n?    training\n\n?    contractors\n\n?    pre-startup safety review\n\n?    mechanical integrity\n\n?    hot work permits\n\n?    management of change\n\n?    incident investigation\n\n \n\n?    emergency planning and response\n\n?    compliance audits\n\n\n\nThe OSHA PSMP is directed at protecting the health and safety of the employees working around the covered chemical process.  The different parts of the PSMP do not consider the possible off-site consequences of a problem with a covered chemical process.  A new program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) addresses the off-site consequences of problems at facilities with a covered chemical process. This new program is called the Risk Management Program and is described in 40 CFR 68.  The information required for the RMP is nearly identical to the information in the PSM, with one exception -- the RMP includes sections "

      "SummaryText": "regarding the off-site consequences of a chemical release at a facility.\n\n\n\n1.2    APPLICABILITY\n\n\n\nAn obligation to comply with the PSM and/or RMP regulations is incurred if a facility uses more than a ?threshold quantity? of a covered chemical.  Each regulation contains a list of covered chemicals, and each chemical has a threshold quantity.  If a facility holds a listed chemical in a larger quantity than the threshold quantity, the facility must have a PSM and/or RMP in place.  The list of chemicals covered, and threshold quantities, is very similar from the PSM to the RMP. A significant difference between the programs involves the threshold quantity for chlorine:\n\n\n\nPSM threshold quantity for chlorine = 1,500 lbs. (29 CFR 1910.119, Appendix A)\n\nRMP threshold quantity for chlorine = 2,500 lbs. (40 CFR 68.130, Table 1)\n\n\n\nThe JRSB WWTP uses chlorine in quantities larger than the threshold quantities listed in the regulations, so both PSM and RMP regulations apply. This document includes all of the information required to describe both the PSM and RMP at the JRSB WWTP. All information required for the OSHA PSM program is listed first; the additional information for the USEPA RMP follows. Recordkeeping requirements for each program are shown in a separate section near the end of the report.\n\n\n\n \n\n1.3    SITE DESCRIPTION\n\n\n\nThe JRSB WWTP is located on Ecology Lane in West Haverstraw, NY.  The facility uses chlorine to disinfect wastewater seasonally (May 15-October 15). The chlorine is stored in steel cylinders, each holding either 2,000 lbs. (1 ton) or 150 lbs. of liquefied gaseous chemical. The maximum inventory capacity at the site is nine 2,000-lb. cylinders in the chlorine building, but the JRSP keeps an operational inventory of no more than eight cylinders on site. Ten 150-lb. cylinders are kept in the sludge treatment building. This equates to a maximum on-site inventory of 19,500 lbs. of liquefied gaseous chlorine and a maximum operational inventory of 17,500 lbs.\n"
