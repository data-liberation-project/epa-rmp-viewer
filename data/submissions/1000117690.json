ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Lilly Technology Center (LTC) is committed to operating and maintaining all processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This is especially important for those processes using hazardous substances.  LTC has numerous systems in place to manage these chemicals.  Lilly uses a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure the safety of employees and the public, as well as protection of the environment.  Lilly\u0092s accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals.\n\nThe LTC has an Integrated Contingency Plan that contains procedures on how to handle emergencies that occur.  This plan includes procedures for notification of local authorities and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.  Additionally, individual business areas at the LTC site maintain local emergency response procedures which focus on the actions of local personnel in the event of an emergency.\n\nThe LTC plays an active role in its Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

The plan is available for public inspection.\n\nThe LTC actively supports community outreach efforts through Community Advisory Panels and neighbor groups.  These panels provide useful feedback from the community and advise Lilly on community issues.  Lilly also hosts plant tours and informative sessions for nearby neighbors.\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nEli Lilly produces a variety of pharmaceutical products using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The LTC is bounded by Raymond Street on the South, Harding Street on the West, and Morris Street on the North (plus one property to the north of Morris Street which totals 9 acres); the LTC Site is comprised of 267 total acres.  LTC North was originally opened in 1946 and LTC South in 1968.  The following regulated substances are handled at LTC in quantities above the threshold quantities established under the RMP regulations:\n\nToxics:  Ethylenediamine, Ammonia (conc 20% or greater), Hydrochloric acid (conc 37% or greater)\n\nFlammables:  None\n\n3.

OSHA has designated the LTC site as a Star site.  A Star designation is a recognition for employers who demonstrate exemplary achievement in the prevention and control of occupational safety and health hazards, the development, implementation and continuous improvement of their safety and health management system.  The LTC site was evaluated through a 3-week inspection in April and May 2023 to retain its Star designation. \n\nLilly has also been a part of the American Chemistry Council (ACC) Responsible Care\u00ae initiative since it was enacted by the U.S. chemical industry in 1988.  Responsible Care is the chemical manufacturing industry\u0092s environmental, health, safety and security performance initiative and is aimed at helping member companies enhance performance and improve the health and safety of their employees, the communities in which they operate and the environment as a whole.  At Lilly our strategy has been to integrate the Responsible Care Guiding Principles into our Global HSE Procedure and HSE Standards.  Internal assessments and external audits occur on a three-year frequency to confirm conformance.\n\nLilly takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe LTC has had no accidents as defined in 40 CFR 68.42 during the past five years.\n\n5.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEmergency Management at Lilly Technology Center\nThe LTC emergency response plan is linked to the plans of the Marion County Emergency Planning Committee.  The site\u0092s response is coordinated by plant security using the plant\u0092s emergency response teams and equipment.  The emergency response plan spells out the \u0093hows\u0094 of emergency response and the roles and responsibilities of the incident response and management response teams.  It includes response procedures that are applicable for each building/area of the plant.  Periodic tabletops, functional drills and exercises test readiness and help employees practice responses to alarms and incidents.  The emergency response plan has been written based upon the \u0093one-plan\u0094 EPA guidance and covers all topics based on that guidance.\n\nRAVE System\nThe LTC implemented an innovative community emergency notification system in 1996.  The RAVE system is an automated phone messaging system that can send a recorded message to everyone who lives or works within one mile of the plant site.  The system calls every number up to three times if there is no answer initially.  It also generates a report advising what phones were not answered.\n\nLilly Fire Rescue (LFR)\nThe Lilly Indianapolis plant sites have a trained emergency response team, Lilly Fire Rescue (LFR), made up of full time emergency staff and trained extended staff members (volunteers who have other job duties but can be called as needed). LFR is trained as an all hazard response team including Fire, Rescue, HazMat and EMS. LFR will respond to any emergency situation on the plant site when called. When Security ha"

On-site training facilities and simulators facilitate the training process.  In an emergency situation, one of the site emergency coordinators (or designate) becomes the incident commander.  LFR has the responsibility for maintaining the emergency response equipment.

LFR personnel are trained to the Hazmat Technician level and to use proper equipment and techniques to stabilize a hazardous area and rescue employees who may need help.  This team undergoes rigorous monthly training in HAZMAT response.  \n\nConfined Space Rescue Team\nPart of the training for LFR also includes Confined Space Rescue.  LFR specializes in rescue from tanks, pits, and other confined areas.
