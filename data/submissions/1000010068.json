This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and incorporating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  At the time of this filing, the East and West FHR refineries in Corpus Christi continue to enjoy a safety record paramount in the refining industry with a combined record of greater than 18 million man-hours without a lost-time work injury.  As part of the preparation of this update, FHR undertook a thorough review, including review by an independent consultant, of all of its RMP data and calculations.  As a result, there are significant changes and improvements in the current RMP, including updated amounts of regulated substances, revised release scenarios, and updated information regarding accident history.  This RMP is for FHR East Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The FHR West Refinery is addressed in a separate EPA RMP submittal.\n\nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing.  For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR East refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining'.\n\nFHRA?s emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, in-plant industrial emergency response group (Refinery Terminal Fire Company - RTFC).  In addition, over one hundred trained emergency responders could be deployed with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment within an hour if necessary d"

Another aspect of our emergency response capabilities is notification of our adjacent neighbors through the Crisis Management Dispatch (CMD), a computerized calling network capable of simultaneous calling to pre-determined calling zones, and Radio Broadcast FM 87.5.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nFHR operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc; however, no threshold quantities of EPA RMP toxic chemicals are handled at the refinery.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nPursuant to EPAA?s guidance, A?If you have had a release of a regulated substance from a process where the regulated substance is held below its threshold quantity, you do not need to report that release even if the release caused one of listed impacts or if the process is covered for some other substance.  You may choose to report the release in the five-year accident history, but you are not required to do so.\"  EPA's General Risk Management Plan Guidance, Chapter 3, 3.1, (updated March 2009).\n\nTherefore, out of an abundance of caution and pursuant to this guidance, FHR has chosen to include information regarding a fire in a covered process, FCCU II, which occurred on May 19, 2009.  Information concerning this event is included in the five year accident history for this process.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at FHR.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.

Examples of employee participation included, but are not limited to updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams and facilitating and participating in incident investigations.  Employees are to have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Additionally, the refinery has a number of processes that address process safety and accident prevention.  These processes include teams such as the Central Environmental Health and Safety Council (CEHSC), Hazard Recognition Team (HRT), and the Refinery Process Safety Committee (RPSC).  Each of the teams contains members from across the refinery, including employees from operations, maintenance, engineering, as well as refinery management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFHRA?s policy is to maintain technical documents that are to be used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents are to address chemical properties, their associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Records Department within the refinery is the primary repository for process safety information.  FHR also makes certain process safety information available on the FHR Intranet.  \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is to be provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is to specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery h"

The refinery is to maintain these parameters within defined limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also is to maintain numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information it to include materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, is to provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nWithin the PHA program, each process is to be systematically examined to identify hazards and confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage potential hazards.  FHR primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform the majority of the PHA evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique.  The analyses are to be conducted with a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA team is to be led by a leader with experience and qualification in the HAZOP analysis technique.  This team is to identify and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\nThe PHA team findings are typically to be addressed by assigning action items to appropriate refinery personnel.  Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is to be based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  Thi"

All PHA action items are to be tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Action Item Tracking System, LYNX.  Within this system, each employee assigned an action is responsible for its execution by an assigned target date.  If the employee neglects or forgets to execute their action item, they are automatically reminded via email of their assigned action and upcoming due date.  For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.  \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHRA?s practice is to periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  The results and findings from base and revalidation PHAs are to be documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFHRA?s policy is to maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are to be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are to be maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, FHRA?s policy is to maintain upper and lower safe operating limits for all process equipment in the Unit Operating Procedures and provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.

New employees are to receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing the basic training, an operator in training is to be paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically are to receive refresher training to confirm that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is to be conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is to be documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nFHR uses contractors to supplement its workforce as part of routine practices or during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Before a contract employer is accepted at FHR, the contract employer is asked to complete a Standardized Contractor Questionnaire Verified (SCQ-V) indicating the contract employers' safety record in industry.  The SCQ-V is FHR's initial screening process for accepting a contract employer to work at the refinery and also used as an ongoing screening tool to renew and approve continued support from contract employers.  \n\nBecause some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place designed to oversee that contractors:\nA? perform work in a safe manner, \nA? have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \nA? are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \nA? understand what they should do in the event of an emerg"

In addition, FHRA?s practice is to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Refinery personnel are to periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFHRA?s policy is to conduct a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team is to use checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR is to involve field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFHR has practices and procedures that are intended to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program are to include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Written toolbox and vendor procedures are to be used help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are to be performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees are to correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team is to review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  FHRA?s practice is to incorporate quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This is intended to help ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFHR has safe work practices in place that are intended to be used to ensure worker safety within the facility.  Examples of these include the following:\nA? Security control and badge reader systems that regulate the entrance, presence and exit of all personnel and contractors at FHR,\nA?

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are to be reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are to be updated to incorporate these changes.  Employees involved in operating a process, maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are to be informed of and trained in, the change prior to start-up of the process or the affected part of the process.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFHRA?s policy is to promptly investigate all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss (as defined by EPA RMP), or personal injury.

Incident investigation reports are to be retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations. \n\nCompliance Audits\n\nFHRA? policy is to periodically conduct audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are to be conducted at least every three-years or on an as needed basis to track compliance with PSM requirements.  At minimum, an audit team composed of personnel knowledgeable in PSM requirements, auditing techniques and process unit technology is to conduct the comprehensive audit that is executed once every 3 years.  The audit team is to develop findings in the form of action items that are documented in an audit report and the action items from the audit are to be placed in LYNX.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are to be tracked in LYNX.

When necessary, the emergency response program changes are to be administered through the Safety Department, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for FHR is coordinated with FHR Emergency Response Team, RTFC, Local Emergency Response Agencies and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  FHR has around-the-clock communications capability with these organizations.  At least four times a year, FHR's Emergency Response Team and these organizations are involved in an onsite test drill that is evaluated for effectiveness if an emergency should ever occur.  This drill is intended to provide a means to ensure the emergency public notification system is in working order, as well as facilitate practice and orderly response to potential emergency events. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nFHRA?s policy is to pursue continuous improvement through the use of tools such as follows:\n\nA?
