For less significant changes, communicating information about the change and its anticipated effects on operation/maintenance may substitute for training sessions.\r\n\r\n1.6. PRE-STARTUP REVIEW\r\n\r\nNew facilities and modified facilities (when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information) must conduct a PSSR. The PSSR process is used in conjunction with the MOC  process. If the change triggers a PSSR, then approval for startup also satisfies the site's PSSR requirements. The PSSR process requires the appropriate personnel to verify that the change was constructed and installed per the approved design and equipment specifications following the completion of the installation and prior to startup.\r\n\r\n1.7. COMPLIANCE AUDITS\r\n\r\nSGS audits the RMP/PSM program every three years and verifies that the procedures and practices developed to comply with the RMP Prevention Program and PSM regulations are adequate and followed.  A team knowledgeable in the process, but impartial to the facility or area being audited, conducts compliance audits.  The audit team develops findings and forwards them to SGS Management for resolution.  SGS tracks corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings to closure as outlined in the Compliance Audit Policy, documents the final resolution of each finding and saves the two most recent audit reports on the internal server.  SGS communicates the audit results to relevant personnel and identifies additional training opportunities.   \r\n\r\n1.8. INCIDENT INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nSGS conducts an investigation for every incident that results, or could reasonably have resulted, in a release of Ammonia from the Ammonia System according to the Incident Reporting and Investigation Procedure.

SGS makes all new employees aware of the RMP/PSM program as a part of the initial orientation process.  At least one hourly employee or representative of the hourly employee directly involved in the operation or maintenance of the site operations is in all meetings and/or formal discussions concerning RMP/PSM policies and procedures.

SGS's Emergency Response Team coordinates with the Apache County Local Emergency Planning Committee to plan and respond to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.

SGS uses an ammonia system process at Generating Units 3 and 4 that contains Anhydrous Ammonia in inventories greater than the RMP and PSM threshold quantities of 10,000 lbs. The ammonia system supplies the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system with a consistent and reliable source of Anhydrous Ammonia. The ammonia system includes the storage and injection areas. The storage equipment consists of two (2) storage tanks (each having a maximum capacity of 22,840 gallons with an 85% administrative control), rail tank car unloading station, truck unloading station, tank heaters and ammonia supply vaporizer. The injection equipment in the SCR area consists of vapor dilution skids, balancing manifolds, and Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG).\r\n\r\nSGS's Anhydrous Ammonia covered process is subject to the Program 3 prevention program requirements of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule, and aligns with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (1910.119). SGS takes the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Release Prevention Program that are in place at SGS.\r\n\r\n1.1. PROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nProcess Safety Information pertains to highly hazardous chemicals in the process, technology of the process, and equipment in the process. Examples of Process Safety Information include but are not limited to Safety Data Sheets and Piping, and Instrumentation Diagrams. SGS updates its Process Safety Information using a Management of Change (MOC) process to ensure critical safety information remains accurate for safe operation of the site.

The purpose of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is to perform a systematic review of existing and/or proposed processes to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.\r\n\r\nThe SGS management team (team) with expertise in engineering and process operations conduct the PHA. The team is comprised of the SGS Station Manager and his/her direct reports (i.e. Superintendents and select supervisors).  This team reviews and approves recommendations. Once approved, the team assigns the appropriate personnel corrective actions for follow-up. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as the control measures (prevention and mitigation) currently in place and makes recommendations for additional control measures as appropriate to reduce risks to as low as reasonably practicable. \r\n\r\nSGS tracks action items to closure as outlined in the PHA Policy to ensure it completes follow-up items in a timely manner.
