The \r\nanhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the \r\nprocessing and storage temperature for margarine and related products.  \r\nIt is a closed system that contains approximately  30,700 pounds (i.e.,  \r\n5,900 gallons) of ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and \r\nsaturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the low side suction accumulator \r\n(low accumulator) that operates at approximately 0 psig and can contain \r\nas much as 9,800 pounds of liquid ammonia.  However, during typical \r\noperation, the vessel holds only about  2,800 pounds.  Most of the \r\nammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up \r\nair units, and some piping runs are located outdoors, on the roof of the \r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThis RMP submission is a revision to the RMP initially submitted in 1999.  \r\nThe RMP has been revised to reflect revised facility contacts as well as \r\nadditional equipment that has been added to the refrigeration system.  \r\nThese changes have increased the overall inventory of ammonia at the \r\nfacility, but did not impact the worst-case release scenario because the \r\nlargest vessel did not change.\r\n\r\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial \r\nuse throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at \r\nreasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and \r\npotentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small \r\nleak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, \r\npiping, and equip"

In addition, even small and non-hazardous \r\nreleases of ammonia are easily detected by smell.\r\n\r\n1.2\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a two-stage system consisting of a \r\nhigh pressure side and a low pressure side.  The margarine processing \r\nunits (MPUs) operate on the low side (i.e., low pressure) to quickly freeze \r\nproduct on scrape surface heat exchangers.  Ammonia suction from the \r\nMPUs at about 0 psig passes through the low accumulator before entering \r\nthe booster compressors.  Any liquid ammonia in the low side suction is \r\ntrapped in the low side accumulators and returned as high pressure liquid \r\nfor the system.  The booster discharge passes through an intercooler/high \r\nside suction before entering the high side compressors.  The high side \r\ncompressor suction draws from the intercooler/high side suction \r\naccumulator at about 25 psig (booster discharge).  This accumulator \r\nreceives suction from various cooler units.  Excess ammonia liquid that \r\ncollects in the high side accumulator is removed and return to the system.  \r\nThe major discharge from the high side compressors (hot gas) is vented to  \r\nseven condensing towers.  A portion of the hot gas is also used for \r\ndefrosting and for operation of the pumper drums.  The condensed liquid \r\nis returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the low and \r\nhigh side equipment, including the MPUs, cooler units, and air handlers.\r\n\r\nSeveral changes were made to the system from 1999 to 2002.  These \r\nchanges include:\r\n\r\nThree MPUs and a water chiller were added from the Unilever-Dallas, \r\nTexas facility; \r\n\r\nA roof-mounted air handling unit was moved;\r\n\r\nA dry warehouse was converted to a storage cooler (3 evaporators were \r\nadded); and\r\n\r\nOne condensing tower is being moved, two new towers are being added, \r\nand a water sump has been installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is protected by the existence of specific \r\nsafety systems/hardware, including safety"

Safety relief valves protect the \r\ncompressor discharge, condensers, pumper drums, suction accumulators, \r\nintercooler, and pump-out system from the hazards associated with \r\noverpressure.  Safety interlocks include high pressure and high \r\ntemperature alarms and cutouts for the compressors, as well as high level \r\nfloats and sensors for vessels.  \r\n2.0\tPOTENTIAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\r\nThe refrigeration system is a totally closed system.  Historically, releases \r\nof ammonia from industrial refrigeration systems most often occur from \r\nleaking valves, malfunctioning pressure relief devices, or inadvertent \r\nreleases during repair activities.  While these incidents can impact \r\nemployees, they seldom lead to a release of a reportable quantity or \r\nrepresent an off-site impact (i.e., beyond the properly line).\r\n\r\nConsistent with the RMP rule requirements, two specifically defined \r\nrelease scenarios (a worst-case release and an alternative release) were \r\nanalyzed to determine the maximum distance to an endpoint where the \r\nammonia concentration is 200 parts per million in air, or 0.02 percent.  \r\nThis endpoint represents the maximum airborne concentration below \r\nwhich nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without \r\nexperiencing or developing irreversible effects or symptoms that could \r\nimpair their ability to take protective action.\r\n\r\nThe release scenarios analyzed are based upon the guidance contained in \r\nthe USEPA's Risk Management Program  Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration \r\n(the Model Plan), dated April 2000.  This guidance document used the \r\nSACRUNCH atmospheric dispersion model to construct lookup tables \r\nthat relate the quantity and rate of ammonia released to the endpoint \r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nCertain details of the release scenario are included only in the data \r\nelements (and not this summary), consistent with the Chemical Safety \r\nInformation, Site Security, and F"

Although the vessel is located indoors, passive \r\nmigration from the building was not used to reduce the estimated impact \r\nbecause of the pressures associated with a large ammonia release.\r\n\r\nAlthough the worst-case consequence analysis is required by the RMP, it \r\nshould be considered a highly unlikely event.  Design, construction, and \r\noperation of the low accumulator (and other ammonia vessels) is such that \r\ncatastrophic failure is extremely remote.  The receiver was designed and \r\nconstructed in strict accordance with the American Society of Mechanical \r\nEngineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section VIII), and was \r\ncertified and stamped by the National Board of Pressure Vessel Inspectors \r\n(National Board).  Third party and state mandated inspections of the \r\nvessel's condition occurs every three years by a Factory Mutual inspector \r\nwho has been certified by the National Board.  In addition, the vessel is \r\ninspected on a semi-annual basis by a competent ammonia refrigeration \r\ncontractor.  The vessel is also inspected daily by a plant facility mechanic, \r\ntrained in the operation of the system.\r\n\r\nThere are two plausible causes for a catastrophic loss of containment of \r\nthe low accumulator:  (1) the internal pressure were to increase \r\nuncontrollably and rupture the vessel from the inside; or (2) rupture of the \r\nvessel wall due to inadvertent contact (e.g., vehicular) from the outside.  \r\nHowever, the vessel is operated well below the design pressure (i.e., \r\nmaximum allowable working pressure) of 150 psig and because of the \r\nsafety factors built into the ASME Code, a fourfold pressure excursion, to \r\napproximately 600 psig, would have to occur before catastrophic vessel \r\nfailure.  Such pressures could n"

The only \r\nlogical external cause of high pressure would be flame impingement or \r\nsurface radiation from a high challenge fire adjacent to the vessel.  If this \r\nwere to occur, the vessel is equipped with a safety relief valve (SRV) set to \r\nrelieve internal pressure at 150 psig.  A high pressure excursion would not \r\noccur as long as the SRV continued to function.  Actuation of the SRV \r\nwould result in an ammonia release similar to that described in Section 2.2 \r\nfor the alternative release scenario.
