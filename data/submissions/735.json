      "SummaryText": "\n\n\nPlaza-Makoti Equity Elevator, in compliance with EPA regulations for Anhydrous Ammonia storage, has a policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local laws.  In the event of an emergency it is our policy to notify Mountrail County emergency officials and request they respond to the emergency.  This facility is a full service country grain elevator which supplies Anhydrous Ammonia to retail agricultural customers through a 30,000 gal. storage tank with associated piping, valves, and approximately 16 nurse tanks.  Our worst case scenario accident would be a rupture of the 30;000 gal. storage facility when filled to 85% capacity.  According to EPA tables, this release could potentially affect an area to a 4.4 mile endpoint from our facility and would require notification and evacuation of an estimated 200 inhabitants.  This facility is operated under regulation and inspection by the State Insurance Dept. (Boiler Inspector) in compliance with EPA's accident prevention rule and State law.  This facility has never had a reportable accident due to the accidental release or discharge of Anhydrous Ammonia.  In the event of an emergency it is our policy to notify emergency response by use of the county 911 system."
