The five-year accident history.\nThe emergency response program.\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n1.    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source.\n\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies.\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Phillips Foods, Inc., Baltimore Maryland (PR) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of PFI's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, PFI is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the Phillips Foods, Inc. facility refrigeration system. The liquid is circulated as needed to the evaporators where heat is absorbed and removed from the medium. The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a dosed lo"

The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the Phillips Foods, Inc. facility's building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps.\n\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia. Phillips Foods, Inc. is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n\n6.    The emergency response program.\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. Phillips Foods, Inc. has a detailed Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. PFI conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n7.    Planned changes to improve safety\n\nAn audit of the RMP was recently completed by EPA.  A few non-mandatory recommendations were made and no citations were issued. Phillips Foods, Inc. plans to implement most of those recommendations in order to enhance the dafety of the process.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "
