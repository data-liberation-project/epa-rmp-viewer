The Environmental Engineer has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Lumileds employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nLumileds is operating four ISO containers containing 26,400 lb.  each of high purity white anhydrous ammonia with two online and two in standby. Each ISO container has the following safety equipment: 0.171\" restricted flow orifice, excess flow mechanical switch and air operated fail-closed control valve. Each ISO container is connected to a dedicated GASGUARD&reg; Very High Flow System (VFFS) with an AP11 controller monitors temperature and pressure of each ISO container. Following the VFFS there are associated gas distribution systems, tools, detection and abatement systems (Wet Scrubbers and Adsorbent (Purafil) Abatement System). The ISO containers and VFFS system have a Pad #1 (Right/West Side) and Pad #2 (Left/East Side). Each Pad (side) has one ISO container online and one ISO container in standby. The Pad #1 (Right/West Side) and Pad #2 (Left/East Side) have one line that flows to Manual Valve Manifold Box (VMB) which has a common header with a typically open valve between Pad #1 (Right/West Side) and Pad #2 (Left/East Side). The VMB header feeds the MOCVD reactors within the facility. The lines from the VMB to MOCVD reactors contain equipment to filter, regulate, purify, and monitor flows from the bulk ammonia containers.  See Attachment One for Flow Schematic.\r\nIn addition to using Versum Material's proven safety control systems, Lumileds has performed a process hazard analysis (PHA) on the bulk ammonia syst"

The PHA was last revalidated 2020.\r\nThe site includes a building with a facilities pad, an ammonia ISO container enclosure that contains the four bulk anhydrous ammonia ISO containers, and an ammonia Purafil abatement system. \r\nThis anhydrous ammonia system is the only process at this site to which the CALARP RMP requirements are applicable.\r\nRelease Scenarios\r\nThe worst-case release quantity was defined as the total quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the online Bulk Anhydrous Ammonia ISO Tank and MOCVD Tools system or a ruptured ISO tank (i.e. 26,400 pounds). Since the vessel is located outdoors, there are no mitigating controls assumed.\r\nThe alternative release scenarios considered both the five-year accident history and the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted at Lumileds on April 3rd, April 28th and April 29th of 2020. When these other scenarios were evaluated, the end results were no worse than the selected alternative release scenario. The selected alternative release scenario assumed that the gas line from the bulk anhydrous ammonia ISO Tank was broken and the tank released at the maximum anhydrous ammonia gas flow rate of 49.75 lbs./min with the excess flow valve closing in 1 minute.\r\n\tThe selected scenario was determined as the most likely scenario that would have an off-site exposure. The release point would be at the ammonia enclosure where the Bulk Anhydrous Ammonia ISO tanks are stored and that the release is not contained within the system exhausted enclosure. The line that may release is between the ISO tank and the high pressure regulator enclosure.  \r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at Lumileds is accomplished through: \r\n-\tSound industry practice anhydrous ammonia tonner \r\n-\tAixtron tool system design and construction,\r\n-\tSpecification and review of system modifications,"
