The warehouse was retrofitted in 2010 to meet Seismic risks.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nAs an active member of the National Association of Chemical Distributors, we maintain a documented program, The Responsible Distribution Process. With a focus on safety and environmental control, it includes SOPs, personnel training/competency requirements; Emergency Response Plans.\n\n\n\nPolicy: It is the policy of Norman, Fox & Co. to promote Senior Management Commitment through policy, communications, and resources, to on-going improvements in chemical compounding, chemical distribution and safety. \n\n\n\nResponsible Distribution Code: I.A. \n\n\n\nSenior Management Commitment is expressed through its :\n\n\n\n1.

Fire Dept. in accordance with California regulations using CERS (California Environmental Reporting System).\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Emergency Response Plan is maintained for use by the Facility Emergency Response authorities. \n\n\n\nAll Operations personnel (i.e. warehouse, production, drivers) are trained and certified Hazwoper 1st Responder Operations level. Office personnel are in the process of training to Hazwoper 1st Responder Awareness Level   as it relates to this new location. These certificates are expected to be maintained. \n\n\n\nIn response to a leak, spill, fire, explosion or airborne release, our Emergency Response Plan (tested annually)  is activated using dedicated emergency equipment (15 pre-placed Spill Kits), and calling in our Response Contractor as required. The objective in response is to: protect personnel; control or contain any release; decontamination and waste disposal. \n\n\n\nThe facility responds to Incidental and Non-Incidental Releases. When the release is non-incidental, the Fire Dept. is notified. This also occurs for any fire situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety (Revised 2013)\n\n\n\n1"
