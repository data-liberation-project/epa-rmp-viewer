      "SummaryText": "Elbow Farm Supply, Inc. is a Grower Owned Farm Supply which supplies Anhydrous Ammonia to our Stock holders as a fertilizer for their crops.  This facility consists of one 30,000 gallon tank with associated loading and unloading pump, piping, load hoses, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  This tank is located on our 40 acre premises which is enclosed with a cyclone fence.  Gates are locked on non-business hours.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accident Prevention Rule and all applicable state (CAL-OSHA) and local regulations and codes.  The Anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance to California Standards Title 8.\n\nOur worst case scenario is failure of the 30,000 gallon tank, when filled to 85%, calculated to 131,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, causing a toxic spill into the atmosphere.  The estimated distance to toxic end point under Urban surroundings is 4.4 miles, which circles an estimated population of 52,100 which includes approximately thirteen (13) schools.  The nearest school being about 1.5 miles away.  We have agricultural to the North, South and West of us with residental to the East of us.\n\nThis facility has never had an acident involving Anhydrous Ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our Anhydrous Ammonia System it is our policy to notify the Ivanhoe Fire Station and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with  the fire department to coordinate such a response.\n\nSafety meetings are conducted on a regular basis when product is being moved.  Only authorized, trained personnel are to handle, transfer, load, etc. Anhydrous Ammonia."
