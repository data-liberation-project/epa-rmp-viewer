In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  \nThese programs enable our facility to minimize the occurrence and consequences of significant releases \nof toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  \nOverall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid\nphysical property damage.\n\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, \nhandling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and \nseparate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release \nshall be considered a single process.  \n\n\nOur safety programs show a commitment to safety and implimentation of safe procedures to minimize \naccidents as they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices that govern individual processes, activities, \nor equipment.  These programs are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to\nand accepted by all associates at the facility.\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThis facility is a frozen vegetable processing plant, which produces bulk frozen peas, various green beans,\ncob corn, cut corn and carrots.  These vegetables are locally grown and transported to our facility for \nprocessing. The refrigeration process for freezing these vegatables involves the use of Anhydrous Ammonia.  \n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at this facility consists of various pumps, compressors, and condensers\nthat are used to change t"

The system that contains 4,286 pounds operates our cold storage warehouse. \n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe general accident prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps were developed as \nrequired and they comply with OSHA PSM Standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA RM Program regulations\nin 40 CFR Part 68.  The key prevention steps at the facility consist of the following:\n\n\n- Process Safety Information\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n- Standard Operating Procedures\n- Training\n- Management of Change\n- Pre-startup Safety Review\n- Compliance Audits\n- Incident Investigation\n- Employee Participation\n- Hot Work Permit\n- Contractor Qualifications\n- Comprehensive Yearly Maintenance Program\n- Ammonia Detection System\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario Update:\n\nIn the update of the worst case scenario we used the ALOHA program supplied by Genesee County Emergency Management. Based on the ALOHA program, Stability Class F was not compatable with any of the scenarios run. Stability class B matched with the conditions entered.\n\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of ammonia to report over the past five years, that have resulted in a major or\nminor injury to an associate.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nBergens' emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action \nPlans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR .120)  We have trained associates for \nemergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.
