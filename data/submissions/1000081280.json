      "SummaryText": "the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Berkeley Farms - Hayward facility is located at 25500 Clawiter Road in Hayward, California, which is approximately 0.2 miles north of Highway 92 and 1.4 miles west of Interstate 880. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of commercial and residential areas.  \n\n\n\nIn order to conduct operations, the facility currently uses a maximum of 26,500 pounds of ammonia in its ammonia refrigeration system. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) to provide refrigeration for cold storage and manufacturing of dairy products.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Berkeley Farms - Hayward ammonia system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. \n\n\n\nThe PSM / RMP / CalARP program ensures that all security and safety procedures are addressed.  Staff is trained in operation, maintenance and emergency procedures related to the operation of the ammonia system.  All pressure vessels in the ammonia system are equipped with relief valves that vent to the atmosphere at a certain pressure set point. A preventative maintenance program assures that equipment is maintained and serviced on a regular schedule and that worn, aging, or defective components are replaced as required to maintain equipment in good operating condition.  Controls and safety devices are inspected regularly to ensure proper operation.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"An unanticipated emission of a regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into the amb"

On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history conducted during the Process Hazard Analysis study on June 6, 2019, there have been no releases of ammonia that meet this criteria in the past five years (June 2014 - June 2019). In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases or \"near misses\" that warranted an internal incident investigation. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nBerkeley Farms - Hayward is a non-responding facility and has an emergency action plan (EAP) in effect. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n\n\n1. To save lives.\n\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n3. To protect the environment.\n\n4. To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM / RMP / CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an ammonia emergency, the operator of the Berkeley Farms - Hayward facility plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department). The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study, conducted on June 6, 2019, including a Hazard and Oper"
