Policies in effect relate to operations and maintenance of equipment, ongoing employee training, emergency action planning and coordination with appropriate local response agencies.  These policies are embodied in the Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Manual, which together provide the means to prevent or mitigate accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThe Generostee Creek WWTP is located at 800 Hillhouse Road, Anderson, SC.  This facility treats domestic and industrial wastewaters for subsequent discharge into the Big Generostee Creek under NPDES Permit No. SC0023752.  Treatment processes include solids screening, trickling filters, clarification, disinfection, and dechlorination.\n\n\n\nDisinfection is accomplished by chlorination and dechlorination is accomplished by sulfonation of the plant effluent just prior to discharge.  Facilities in place to accomplish this task include pumping, chlorinator equipment, and sulfonator equipment to provide a chlorine solution and a sulfur dioxide solution at rates proportional to discharge flow rates.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide for this process is stored and handled on-site in ton cylinders.  Normal operations include four chlorine cylinders on-line with four spare chlorine cylinders in reserve and four sulfur dioxide cylinders online with four spare sulfur dioxide cylinders in reserve.  The on-line cylinders have individual vacuum regulators, and are manifolded on the vacuum side with automatic switchover to the chlorination equipment and sulfonation equipment.\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only regulated substance maintained on-site in quantities above the regulated threshold limit.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is a multi-faceted effort configured to comply with both EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM rules.
