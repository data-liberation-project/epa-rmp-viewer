The ERP includes action to be taken in case of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The proper action includes immediately contacting the Garvin County Emergency Response System, which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public.\r\n\r\nThe facility has ongoing programs that train personnel in areas that have the greatest potential for uncontrolled release of hazardous substances.  In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard assessment, safety training is done to identify and resolve safety issues.\r\n\r\nThe facility is in the process of implementing changes to improve safety.  The facility uses management systems and continuous improvement processes to improve the safety of the process. These management systems are evergreen and incorporate reoccurring review of process hazards, ongoing training for plant personnel, auditing to improve the systems, planned drills, and systems to manage and review changes and their impacts."

No ownership change has occurred; however, BCE-Mach III LLC is updating this information for clarification purposes and within 30 days of the emergency contact email address change.  The Elmore City Gas Plant is owned and operated by BCE-Mach III LLC.  \r\n\r\nThis summary is intended to meet the requirements of 40 CFR Subpart G 68.155.  The Risk Management Program is based on the API Publication 761:  Model Risk Management Plan Guidance for Exploration and Production Facilities.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the Elmore City Gas Plant are those included in the facility's Emergency Response Plan and PSM program.  The Emergency Response Plan covers action to be taken in case of an unplanned release of hazardous substances. The mechanical integrity section of PSM covers action taken to prevent an unplanned accidental release of regulated substances.\r\n\r\nThe Elmore City Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant.  The process consists of:  molecular sieve dehydration, NGL extraction, and liquid / liquid amine stripping.  The mole sieves remove water from the natural gas stream.  The natural gas liquids (NGL) are extracted by chilling the gas using a Turbo Expander, JT valve, and a series of heat exchangers.  The NGL product is conditioned by the liquid / liquid amine contactor to meet CO2 specifications.  The NGL product and residue gas are transported via pipeline to market.\r\n\r\nThe Elmore City Gas Plant was determined to be a program level 3 facility through the worst-case scenario analysis.  Controls include automatic alarms, sensors, controlled vents to flare, and pressure relief valves that prevent an uncontrolled release of hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nThe general accidental release prevention measures taken are outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility.
