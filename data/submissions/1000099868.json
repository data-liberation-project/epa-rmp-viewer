      "SummaryText": "2021 RMP Executive Summary for Valley Garlic Cold Storage with Anhydrous Ammonia Refrigerant\n\n\n\nValley Garlic is expanding it's cold storage area and refrigeration system to cool it. The additional Anhydrous Ammonia refrigerant will take the facility over 10,000 lbs and move it to a Program 3 facility classification. The existing RMP/PSM program is being revised to reflect the additional regulations.\n\n\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nValley Garlic Cold Storage is committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This facility was constructed in 2011. There is a Freon refrigeration system also for another area. Since that time there have been ownership and staff changes. Our facility employees will not respond to emergencies that are dangerous. We have appropriate PPE for comfort and safety only.\n\n \n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nValley Garlic Cold Storage at 500 Enterprise Parkway in Coalinga is currently owned by Spice World Ingredients Holdings, LLC. Primary activities include processing, packaging, cooling and storage of Garlic Products. We have 1 regulated substance above state thresholds present at our facility.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used as a refrigerant in a closed loop refrigeration system. The facility is operated 12 months a year and the onsite ammonia inventory is more than 10,000 lbs. \n\n\n\n\n\n3.The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario are documented in various parts of our program and updated every 5 years. To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, our consultant used the EPA's RMP Comp Software.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. Several residential public receptors were identified in census data for the worst case scenario. \n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Progr"

In this scenario the entire inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released in an enclosed space with direct contact with the outside air.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. RMP Comp and RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration Guidance was used to develop scenarios. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L. The potential residential public receptors was based on the 2010 census data using Marplot and LV6 software. Only 10% of these could actually be impacted depending on the wind direction. \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from a refrigeration compressor seal.  The scenario involves the release of 12 lb./min. for 30 minutes. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) can reach offsite. There are no residential receptors and no public receptors in the alternate release scenario.\n\n\n\n4.The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA and California Accidental Release Prevention Program Title 19 Chapter 4.5. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nManagement System\n\nValley Garlic has a Management system in place to make sure proper oversite and completion of goals occurs with Awareness throughout all Management levels. Where tasks are delgated a table defines goals. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nValley Garlic is interested in cooperative participatory workplace where there is a constant flow of information a"

This includes a sharing of information on the hazards of anhydrous ammonia and the 14 steps of the PSM program with all employees and their ability through formal or informal safety complaint process.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nValley Garlic Cold Storage maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. This includes refrigeration plans and equipment information. Ammonia SDS sheets are in facility SDS binders and available to employees.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is \"What-if-Checklist\".  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner and within 2.5 years.  \n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Valley Garlic maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed yearly or when there is a change and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nValley Garlic has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  A qualified refrigeration contractor with trained service mechanics performs refrigeration system maintenance requiring the system to be opened. Refresher training is provided at least every 3 ye"
