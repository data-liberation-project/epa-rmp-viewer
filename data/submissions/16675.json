      "SummaryText": "ACME Markets, Inc. (\"ACME\") is a diversified retailer of grocery products. ACME is a wholly owned operating unit of American Stores Company (ASC, Salt Lake City, UT). ACME operates many retail grocery stores throughout metropolitan Philadelphia and the surrounding areas that are supplied through a number of distribution and transportation complexes, one of which is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The Philadelphia DC-3 operation employs over 400 people.  Warehouses storing perishable products are cooled by a refrigeration system containing 18,000 pounds of ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is subject to EPA regulation under 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nPursuant to the Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulation (40 CFR 68) and the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), ACME has developed a comprehensive PSM written program to protect employees and the surrounding community from exposure to the hazardous chemicals onsite. The facility completed a process hazards analysis (PHA) for ammonia using the industry standard What-If? Analysis developed through the International Institute for Ammonia Refrigeration. The PHA was completed using technical and operations staff from the ACME facility as well as experienced facilitators from Dames & Moore, an outside engineering firm.\n\nACME is committed to minimizing accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration process at the Philadelphia distribution center.  ACME's implementation of the revised PSM program includes employee education in the hazards of ammonia and measures that can be used to reduce employee and community exposure to accidental releases of ammonia. The plans include preventive maintenance programs (mechanical integrity) for the ammonia system, and a program for both pre-startup safety reviews and management of changes (MOC) to this system. The program also includes specific requirements for safe work practices (such as safe approaches to weldi"

However, as part of the RMP requirements, ACME undertook a review of the potential offsite consequences of the accidental releases of the largest vessels in the system.  Although such a release is highly unlikely, the regulation requires this review. \n\nThe worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 11,938-pound thermosyphon receiver located outdoors. The analysis of this release indicates that a potential exposure of an area approximately 2.6 miles in diameter (distance to endpoint of 1.3 miles) would result. The total population within the potential exposure area is 34,567.  Within this area there are schools, residences, recreation areas, and commercial/industrial areas.\n\nIn determining the alternate case scenario for ammonia, ACME analyzed incidents occurring at other refrigeration facilities and the results of the internal process hazards analysis (PHA). The scenario chosen for the ammonia system assumes a =\" hole in a liquid return pipe from the outside condensers. Such a release would affect an area of 0.34 miles (0.17 miles to the toxic endpoint) and create the potential to affect approximately 25 persons.  Local businesses and residences are located within this area."
