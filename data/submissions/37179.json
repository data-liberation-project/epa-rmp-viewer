This RMP Plan identifies potential sources of releases and processes, which are  managed to reduce the probability of an accidental release.  In addition, this RMP Plan describes the practices used to reduce the likelihood of accidents related to covered processes and assures compliance with the terms and conditions of the Clean Air Act 112r part 68 (CAA), and OSHA Process Safety Management  9PSM) standard 929 CFR 1910.119) Associated with Treatment Plant Activities.\n\n\n\nThis re-submission (RMP*Submit2004 program) uses the same modeling assumptions and parameters used in the 1999 submittal.  The assumptions and parameters are outlined in Section 2 Toxics: Worst Case and Section 3 Toxics: Alternate Release. The Magna Water and Sewer Company indicates that these assumptions and parameters are still valid for the 2004 re-submission1.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nProcess safety and emergency response procedures have been implemented at the POTW facility to minimize or eliminate the impacts from emergencies and/or accidents.  Emergency response plans are fully reviewed and supported by Magna?s management and the RMP coordinator.\n\n\n\nBrief Facility Description\n\n\n\nThe Magna POTW is a sewage treatment plant that treats raw sewage to secondary effluent standards.  Chlorine gas is used on site to disinfect the effluent prior to discharge.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\n\n\nThe potential for discharges of hazardous substances from this facility is minimal.  Magna Water & Sewer Company strictly adheres to good housekeeping and materials management practices in order to forestall inciden"

Materials and equipment necessary for prompt spill clean-up are kept on-site.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThe facility has never experienced a significant release, spill, or leak of any toxic pollutant, hazardous material since 1999.  No significant injuries have been reported since 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAll aspects of this response program have been coordinated with the Salt Lake County Fire Department.  If a release occurs, employees have been trained to take corrective and clean-up actions and notify the RMP coordinator so that he can determine if the spill should be reported to the appropriate agency.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nMonthly meetings are held with all employees to review and improve existing safety procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTES:\n\n\n\n1- Personal conversation with Mr. Steve Williams of the Magna Water & Sewer Company on 6/18/04.\n\n"
