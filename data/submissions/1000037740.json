      "SummaryText": "The Cargill Meat Solutions facility in Ottumwa, Iowa is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions found in Title 40 part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule.  The facility is covered by the rule because it processes anhydrous ammonia in excess of the regulatory thresholds.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the facility?s refrigeration system, and is a listed chemical due to toxicity. \n\n\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years.  The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity.  The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement.  The RMP will be made available to the public.  The purpose of this project was to compile an updated RMP.\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving anhydrous ammonia.  The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that 63,000 pounds of ammonia was released to the atmosphere over a 10-minute period.  The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's RMP Comp.  The distance at which the ammonia concentration in the plume falls below the regulatory endpoint concentration was determined to be 2.8 miles.  It was further determined that within 2.8 miles of the facility there is a population of 21,948 people.  The public receptors identified within 2.8 miles of the facility are residences, schools, recreational areas, and commercial/industrial areas.  The Des Moines River was the only environmental receptor identified within 2.8 miles of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release"

      "SummaryText": " scenario examined a release of ammonia resulting from a failure during normal operation.  This is the same vessel as examined in the worst-case release.  However, for the alternative release scenario the quantity released is based on the more realistic normal operating inventory of the vessel rather than the largest quantity that may ever be present in the vessel.  In this scenario, 40,000 pounds of ammonia are released over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the regulatory endpoint was calculated to be 0.4 miles.  The population within 0.4 miles of the facility was determined to be 247.  Residences, a school, and a commercial/industrial area were the only public or environmental receptors identified within 0.4 miles of the facility.  \n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analyses data and information concerning the facility and the facility's implementation of the risk management program are included in the risk management plan documented in this report.\n\n\n\nThis facility has had one accidental release of ammonia which have resulted in zero deaths, one injuries, and  $40,000 property damage on site. There were no offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. The release lasted for 20hrs 40minutes and the quantity released was 19,319. This release was a gas only release. The date and time of this release was 01/10/2014 at 2:20 PM. Off-site responders were notified and responded to this event.  \n\n\n\nThis facility has developed an Emergency Action Plan which addresses accidental release of hazardous substances and has coordinated with the Wapello County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  The facility is included in the LEPC's community emergency response plan. The facility currently has a HazMat Response Team in place for responding to accidental releases of ammonia which pose a health or safety hazard to persons or property located on site or off site.  Annual training is completed with the California Fire Depa"
