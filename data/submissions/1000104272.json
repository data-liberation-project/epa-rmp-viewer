This process includes a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, comprehensive Facility Inspection, and evaluation of the mitigation measures to improve safety at the Pegasus Foods facility. The Pegasus Foods safety committee is planning to complete several items over the next 5-year period, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees. These changes include the following items:\n1. Continue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\n2. Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n3. Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n4. Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

The facility conducts preventative maintenance and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs or maintenance. The facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code applicable at the time of construction, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room. In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (High Pressure Receiver and Condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves. All of the relief valves are tied into a common relief header that vent to the atmosphere.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Pegasus Foods facility has been in operation since 2018.  There have been no accidental releases to report since startup.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe Pegasus Foods facility has an emergency response plan in effect. The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations. In case of an ammonia emergency, the faci"

Pegasus Foods' safety and environmental policies are administered by the Plant Engineer and General Manager, who conduct periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversee the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP Program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe Pegasus Foods facility is located at 1635 Innovation Drive, Rockwall, Texas.  The facility is located approximately 0.37 miles to the southeast of US Highway 30.  The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial and industrial areas.  The area has seen some growth and development in the 5 years since Pegasus Foods began operation, but the nature of the immediate area remains commercial and industrial. \n\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant within a closed system. Based on system upgrades, the maximum anhydrous ammonia storage capacity of 20,000 pounds of ammonia was evaluated for the worst-case RMP impact. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the processing and cold storage of frozen food products. Typical operating conditions range from 8.8 Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 181 psig on the high side.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe Pegasus Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.
