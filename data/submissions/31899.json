      "SummaryText": "POLICIES\n\nThe Eugene Water & Electric Board (EWEB) is a public utility providing electricity, steam, and drinking water to the citizens of Eugene and several surrounding communities. EWEB's Environmental Policy states that EWEB takes responsibility for the environmental consequences of our actions. EWEB conducts business in an environmentally sensitive and responsible manner while providing our customers with safe, reliable and responsive utility service. Two of the stated objectives of EWEB's environmental commitment are to prevent, minimize or mitigate the environmental impacts of EWEB's products and services, and to safeguard human health in the conduct of our business.\n\n\nREGULATED SUBSTANCES AND PROCESSES\n\nEWEB?s Hayden Bridge Water Filtration Plant (the Water Plant) uses chlorine- a toxic gas- in the production of drinking water. The chlorine is added to treated water (following coagulation, flocculation and filtration) prior to distribution as a disinfectant. Residual levels of chlorine remain in the water throughout the EWEB distribution system. The Water Plant uses chlorine, liquefied by pressure, in one-ton cylinders. The Water Plant?s chlorine containment facility can hold up to twelve one-ton cylinders of chlorine gas (24,000 pounds).\n\n\nFACILITY DESIGN AND PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe Water Plant has been in operation since 1950. There have been no releases of chemicals to the public since the plant began operation.\n\nThe Water Plant has a containment structure (containment building) for chlorine storage and use. The Water Plant uses chlorine, liquefied by pressure, in one-ton cylinders. EWEB owns the one-ton cylinders used for chlorine storage so that we can monitor and ensure the integrity of the containers. \n\nThe storage/process room has a redundant system of chlorine detectors. If a release is detected, building vents to the outside are closed, and the room?s vapors are blown into a scrubber unit that is designed to neutralize the release. The scrubber is s"

      "SummaryText": "ized to handle a one-ton release of chlorine. The containment structure building is built to earthquake codes. \n\nThe chlorine is fed to the finished water through a vacuum system. In the event of a chlorine-feed line break in the plant, the line loses its vacuum and the feeders are shut down, preventing a release.\n\n\nTHE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Water Plant has had no accidents in the last five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nEWEB?s Water Plant has been and intends to continue to be in compliance with EPA and OSHA requirements for the prevention of and response to chemical releases. The Water Plant staff annually reviews, evaluates and drills with its Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) plan and Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The City of Springfield?s Fire & Life Safety Department annually inspects the Water Plant. The Water Plant is also used as a drill practice site by the City of Springfield.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn May 2004, the Water Plant discontinued the use of sulfur dioxide through a process change that eliminated the need for finished water dechlorination. The elimination of the dechlorination process has allowed EWEB to reduce the number of regulated processes and substances in use at the Water Plant. EWEB previously had four one-ton sulfur dioxide cylinders in storage and use at the facility. No additional changes are planned at this time."
