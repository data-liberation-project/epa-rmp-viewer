A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n 4.7\tIncident Investigations\n\nThe TRA Tarrant County Water Supply Project investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The TRA Tarrant County Water Supply Project trains employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.8\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\n\nIndustry standards are followed at the TRA Tarrant County Water Supply Project to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck.  The process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art materials and technology utilizing the standards and guidelines of the Chlorine Institute, Compressed Gas Association, American Water Works Association, ASME, ANSI, and other applicable codes.  Workers who perform operations involving chlorine receive training emphasizing safe handling procedures according to the guidelines required by the TRA Tarrant County Water Supply Project.\n\nChemical-specific Prevention Steps - Ammonia\n\nIndustry standards are followed at the TRA Tarrant County Water Supply Project to help ensure safe handling of ammonia.
