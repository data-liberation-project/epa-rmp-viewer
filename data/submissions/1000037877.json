Lake Charles Chemical Complex\n\nRisk Management Plan\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n\n\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\n\n\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butadiene, propylene, ethane, butene, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPS's list of toxic chemicals and are above EPS's threshold quantity are ethylene oxide and hydrogen fluoride. Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, are sulphur dioxide and ammonia.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards "
