This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to ensure safe operation of the complex. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements made to the operations of the LCCC.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities are performed in a safe manner. This program reviews the safety record of the contractors to ensure the plant only hires contractors who can safety perform the desired task. The complex communicates to the contractor supervisor the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plants safe work practices, and the plants emergency response procedures. The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees on hazards and procedures specific to the complex site. The plant periodically reviews contractors training documents and work performances to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) emergency response program has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response, and notification requirements of the following regulations:\r\n*OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 (a)-Employee Emergency Action Plans\r\n*OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120(q)-Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER)\r\n*OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(n)-Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\r\n*OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart L-Fire Protection\r\n*LADEQ LAC 33.1A\u00bfA\u00a7 3901- Notification Regulations for Unauthorized Disc"

The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training. Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Management of Change program for the LCCC evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes to help ensure that a change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program. All other changes must be confirmed through a full management of change program to help ensure process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the change.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) conducts a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed in service.

Lake Charles Chemical Complex\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butadiene, propylene, ethane, butene, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPS's list of toxic chemicals and are above EPS's threshold quantity are ethylene oxide and hydrogen fluoride. Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, are sulphur dioxide and ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards"
