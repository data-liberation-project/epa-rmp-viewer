This commitment is demonstrated by the resources and efforts expended in accident prevention, including compliance with the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program. Management systems are in place at the Trainer Refinery to ensure safety is incorporated into the design, installation, operation, inspection, and maintenance of our processes. Our accident prevention program includes maintaining updated operating procedures and practices as well as extensive personnel training on safety. We also have highly trained and well-qualified emergency responders onsite 24 hours a day ready to respond to control and mitigate an incident should one occur.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery located in Trainer, PA processes raw crude oil into gasoline and other refining products including jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil, heavy fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and sulfur. The LPG products consist of butane and propane which are both regulated flammable substances. The refinery produces and/or uses other regulated flammables, such as hydrogen, methane, ethane, pentane, etc. In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes hydrofluoric acid, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide which are regulated toxic substances.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic substances is failure of a storage vessel resulting in the release of its entire content of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid with no administrative controls in place while the unit is shut down for maintenance. Approximately every 4 to 5 years, the entire unit's inventory of acid is transferred into this vessel for about 30 days until maintenance is completed. In evaluating this WCS, the numerous safeguards and passive mitigation that are in place to prevent a release and to minimize any c"

A quantity of acid could be released over a 10-minute period before the operators isolated the leak. The elevated water deluge towers would be activated remotely to knock down vapors. The resulting vapor cloud could reach an offsite endpoint and nearby public receptors. This event was selected as a more realistic scenario for use in emergency response planning with the community.\n\n\n\nTwo (2) worst-case scenarios (WCS) were developed for flammable substances as these scenarios potentially affect different public receptors. \n\n\n\nThe first WCS for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of a sphere containing a flammable mixture composed primarily of pentanes. Although there are numerous controls in place to prevent such releases and to control and mitigate their consequences, no administrative controls were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. Therefore, the full vessel inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.

This event was selected as a more realistic scenario for use in emergency response planning with the community.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Trainer Refinery. Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team as well as incident/near miss investigations. Information on the refinery's accident prevention program is available to all employees and they are encouraged to suggest improvements to any of the programs. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives to address process safety and employee safety issues. These activities include committees to promote and address both process and personal safety such as the Central Health, Safety & Environmental Steering Committee, Joint Management Labor Health & Safety Committee, and PSM subcomm"

Other means by which employees are solicited for input and feedback on various PSM programs are through safety meetings, Area Safety Team meetings and audits.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, Safe Operating Limits (SOLA?s) of critical process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location, and updating procedure is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, chemical reactivity/stability hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). For specific process units and operations, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific critical operating and key process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, level, and composition) as part of procedures for normal operations. The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents including piping and instrumentation diagrams that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personne"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of highly experienced people who have operating, engineering, and safety expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nLayer of Protection Analysis, commonly referred to as LOPA, augment Process Hazards Analyses conducted for each covered process. LOPA is a risk assessment tool that was developed to semi-quantitatively evaluate the safety integrity of process operations.  LOPA uses a simple numerical calculation to measure the adequacy of protection layers (alarms, relief valves, control loops, etc.) against the potential consequences of process deviations (loss of containment, personnel exposure, etc.).  The LOPA results give order of magnitude approximation of the risk of a scenario.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures  \n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) normal operations, (2) temporary operations, (3) normal shutdown, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) unit startup and (6) initial startup of a new process.   Troubleshooting guidelines which provide guidance on corrective actions to be taken when responding to upper or lower limit exceedances for critical operating and key process parameters also exist.

Job specific training provides detailed instruction on the process and process equipment. This phase of training includes hands-on demonstrations (or simulations) of start-up, shutdown and emergency operating procedures. It also includes the review and practice of routine, job-specific tasks performed by the operator (e.g. drawing and testing samples). \n\n\n\nAfter operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests & skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically review operating procedures and safe work practices so that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. Performance-based refresher training is conducted monthly through the Refinery Performance Management Process. Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. Depending upon the complexity and the hazard potential associated with the new or modified facility, one (1) of three (3) levels of PSSRs are conducted.

This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, and other facility changes be reviewed and authorized before being implemented. All changes are reviewed to (1) determine that adequate controls are in place to manage and control any new hazards and (2) verify that existing safeguards have not been compromised by the change.

The drops were confirmed to be HF, and the treatment of the operator resulted in overnight hospitalization and observation. \n\n\n\nOn March 20th, 2014 a release of hydrocarbon occurred at the HF Alkylation unit. The leak was origination from tubing leading to a flow transmitter on the HF Stripper Tower feed line. The leak was completely isolated within 30 minutes. When the release initially oc"

There were no injuries to personnel and no ignition of the vapors. However the vapors released at storm water drains adjacent to the public perimeter of the facility resulted in closure of a public road and an evacuation of 15 homes by public safety officials as a precautionary measure.  Additionally, the light hydrocarbon product entered into Marcus Hook Creek causing a number of fish mortalities. A formal incident investigation was conducted and improvements that included revision of equipment isolation and winterization procedures, emergency communication improvements, and installation of hydrocarbon detectors in/ around the non-oily water sewer system was completed to prevent similar incidents from occurring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the Trainer Refinery has proced"

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Trainer Refinery is coordinated with the Delaware County, PA, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Trainer Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., Delaware County 911 Center). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Trainer Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Trainer Refinery emphas continuous improvement to augment and strengthen its accident prevention program. Many of the safeguards have already been instituted and are in place to prevent an accidental release as well as to mitigate or minimize its impact should one occur. Engineering and administrative safeguards will continue to be installed as they are developed as part of the ongoing effort to enhance the overall safe operation of the Trainer Ref"
