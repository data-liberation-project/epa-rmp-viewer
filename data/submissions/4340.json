The primary activity of the plant is treatment of surface water from Burr Oak Lake for drinking water purposes.  The use of chlorine gas, CAS # 7782-50-5, is a major component of the treatment process.  The chlorine used in the treatment process is containerized in steel cylinders in 150 pound quantities.  Up to 16 vessels can be housed at the facility at one time, however, no more than four vessels can be on-line at any one time during the treatment process.  The facility plans to double its production capacity within the next two years and consequently will be increasing their chlorine usage.  The Risk Management Plan (RMP) will be updated at that time to reflect any increases in the use and storage of chlorine.\n\nAccident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe facility has made a commitment to safety and the implementation of safe procedures by stressing on-the-job training and encouraging continued awareness of safe working procedures.  The facility has not had any reportable safety incidents of chemical releases in the last five years.  A review of plant safety procedures is being conducted in conjunction with the filing of the RMP.  Any revisions to plant safety procedures will be noted by updating the facility RMP.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nA worst case scenario was conducted for a release of chlorine gas from the Burr Oak facility using RMP*Comp software obtained from the U.S. EPA.  The scenario assumed a release of all 2,400 pounds of chlorine stored at the facility.  Enclosure of the tanks in the treatment building was considered as active mitigation for the modeled, worst case scenario.\n\nAssuming a release duration of ten minutes, a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class F in a rural setting, the distance to toxic en"

      "SummaryText": "dpoint was calculated as 2.6 miles.  A release of this magnitude would have some off-site impact encompassing some local residences and a portion of Burr Oak State Park. Current operating procedures using proper handling, storage and on-line placement of the vessels and the in-place leak detection system help reduce the likelyhood of a release of this magnitude.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nAn alternative release scenario was conducted for a release of chlorine gas from the facility using RMP*Comp software obtained from the U.S. EPA.  This scenario assumed a release of 600 pounds of chlorine.  This is the amount of chlorine on line at any one time.  A release rate of 20 pounds per minute for a duration of 30 minutes in a rural setting was also assumed.  The wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, and an atmospheric stability clas of D were automaticalyy selected by the model.  Enclosue of the tanks inside the treatment building was considered as active mitigation for the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\n\nThe model calculated a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.20 miles.  Such a release would not be of major significance with only a few residences in the area.  A more significant impact might be had during summer months when the adjacent recreational area has more visitors.  Current operating procedures using proper handling, storage and on-line placement of the vessels and the in-place leak detection system help reduce the likelyhood of a release of this magnitude.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Burr Oak Water Treatment Facility has not had any accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Burr Oak Water Treatment Facility has coordinated emergency response services with local and county police, fire and the Athens County LEPC.  A written emergency response plan is currently being developed in conjunction with the filing of this RMP.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Burr Oak Water Treatment Facility is currently u"
