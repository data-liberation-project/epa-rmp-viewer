Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Aervoe-Pacific are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Aervoe-Pacific manufactures a variety of aerosol products, liquid filled containers, and fuel containers for portable heating devices .  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane, Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-], Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] and Butane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for aerosol propellant.  Propane is used for aerosol propellant.  Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] is used for aerosol propellant.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for aerosol propellant.
