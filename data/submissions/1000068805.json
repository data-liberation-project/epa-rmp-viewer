At that time, it was a retail facility of Fuel Oil and Propane and operated under the name of Royal Oil Co Royal Oil Company ceased retail operations and Broadway Propane was formed as a storage facility.  BPC the Propane Facility itself is situated on land of approximately 50ft x 50ft surrounded by a 6ft fenced in area.  This fence area is locked at all times and can only be accessed by authorized employees or private Company personnel that have an access code for their Propane storage. The Propane facility is located on land referred to as 2092 Broadway, So. Portland, ME 04106 in the rear corner of approximately 3.4 acres, that area is referred to as Broadway Self Storage, Inc.  The entire storage facility is located and secured behind a locked 6ft chain link fence. Any person entering the storage facility must have a gate code that allows them entry to the storage buildings and all Propane persons must have an additional lock code for entry to the Propane facility. The area known as 2092 Broadway is located to the left side of property referred to as 2066 Broadway, So. Portland, ME 04106.  The property of 2066 Broadway has (1) residential house (vacant) and 2 Commercial buildings, and a private residence on the back side of the primary commercial building. Ronald Blanchard the Owner lives in this residence so he is always on site as he works and lives at 2066 Broadway. The BPC is about 530 Ft away from Ron's backdoor.\n\n    The Propane facility consists of three Vertical Steel Tanks.  Each tank is rated to hold 30,000 gallons of propane.  Per specific guidelines the maximum fill is set at 80% therefore each tank could hold 24,000 gallons. Based on daily historical records the facility averages (2017) is 3691.3 gallons on hand per day or 15,503.46 pounds. (The Weights of a gallon of propane vary from 4.11 to 4.25 per gallon, we will use 4.2 as the multiplier) The Propane is consisten"

      "SummaryText": "tly moving in and out of the facility daily.  BPC has never stored or had on hand a daily weight of 304,400 pounds. If BPC has just received transporter delivery of 1 or 2 loads which are 12,500 gallons each then for that day or two BPC may have inventory that would equal approximately 130,000 to 140,000 pounds. Those gallons would then be pulled out by their owners in the same or next day. A 225 Gal. Methanol tank, of Flammable liquid, ( tank at 80%) is on hand for the transporters when unloading/delivering propane to the facility. Methanol acts as an anti-freeze and water/moisture evaporator in the propane.  Ethyl Mercaptan has been added to all propane as an \"odorizer\" by the manufacturer or wholesaler or distributor and is tested for the presence of odor by all person/s who handle the propane including BPC when we receive a delivery by the transporters.  The 50-gallon non-Flammable Nitrogen tanks at the facility are used by the Bobtails when loading their inventory/propane and its purpose is to hold open the valves as the Propane is flowing. \n\n    The purpose of the Propane facility is for storage only, in so far that different Companies purchase their own Propane inventory from a wholesaler and they store their Propane at the facility. Their drivers are given an individual access code to come to the facility and retrieve their propane inventory as needed. There is a specific process that each driver must follow and that description is attached. (Scanned with photo file)\n\n    BPC has two Dresser Flow Control Shut off Valves which prevent the removal of any propane from the facility by anyone other than authorized persons. BPC has installed (4) MSA detectors that monitor for any propane leaks or spills.  BPC has additionally installed a Lexaire-1 system that will shut down the entire propane facility of Nitrogen/Propane/Electricity if any of the 4-MSA detectors react to a leak or spill. The Lexair-1 system will immediately activate the siren and emergency strobe light "

Testing for Emergency Shut off valves, piping/tank systems, MSA detectors are and have been currently tested and passed. These tests are conducted on a quarterly basis.  All of the piping has been marked with the requested arrows and descriptions per propane guidelines. The additional signage requested of the \"diamonds 1-4-0-blank\" have been installed.
