      "SummaryText": "The Pivotal Energy Partners Propane Bulk Storage Facility (herein referred to as \u0093the \nFacility\u0094) consists of two 30,000-gallon, skid-mounted, aboveground ASME propane \nvessels. The vessels store liquified propane for offsite wholesale distribution. Liquid \npropane is transferred to the storage vessels from railcars. Liquid propane is then \ntransferred to transport trucks for offsite delivery.\nThe propane vessels, piping, equipment, loading skids, and rail car offloading rack were \ndesigned by Chesmont Engineering and installed by Hiltz Propane of Marrietta, Pennsylvania in 2023. The propane bulk storage facility was designed to conform to \nNFPA 58 - 2014 edition and 29 CFR 1910.110, including internal valves, redundant, failsafe emergency shutoff valves (ESVs), and excess flow valves (EFV) as described in \nNFPA 58.\nThe vessels and loading/unloading equipment are located inside an industrial chain-linked fence. The tanks have traffic protection in the form of guard rails, traffic bollards, \nand/or jersey-type concrete barriers. The vessels and equipment are located in \naccordance with the setbacks required by NFPA 58 - 2014 edition with respect to \nadjoining property lines, buildings, and other uses."
