This site level Emergency Plan guides the response of Marks RNG, LLC Team Members and resources during an emergency and establishes requirements to effectively prepare for all identified credible emergency scenarios. This is the official Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for the Marks facility and supersedes previous plans and is intended to prevent Team Member actions which are not in accordance with the intent of this plan.\n\nWith respect to fires, the Marks site does not have a fire brigade and is therefore dependent upon the local Fire Department for response to fires that escalate beyond incipient phase.  Properly trained employees can respond to incipient fires requiring one fire extinguisher after notifying the local Fire Department.  The Marks site will work closely with the local Fire Department to prevent fires from occurring and to quickly mitigate fires should they occur.  \nThe Marks Emergency Response Plan (RNG-ALL-P2020 Emergency Response) [16], will be reviewed to ensure that it remains accurate and current. Marks RNG, LLC Team Members are trained on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan when initially hired, when the plan is revised, and when the Team Member\u0092s responsibilities are changed.  All Marks RNG, LLC Team Members will receive annual refresher training on the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan.

MARPLOT was used to overlay the impact area on a map and estimate the population impacted within the endpoints of the WCS and ARS. \nThe MARPLOT version 5.1.1 was used to produce the impact area overlays and estimate the population impacted, which uses 2010 census data. Comparing satellite imagery of area from 2010 to most recent satellite imagery of area from 2022 shows that there were minimal additional residential developments near the facility. Since the residential developments appear to be minor and no other sensitive receptors were added to this area, using the default 2010 census data provided by MARPLOT instead of the 2020 census data does not significantly affect the estimates for the impacted population. \n\nFlammable Worst-Case Scenario\nOne worst-case scenario (WCS) was developed for the Marks facility, as methane is present over the threshold quantities. \nThe WCS was a vapor cloud explosion from an instantaneous release of the total contents of a single digester tank containing 3,069 lbs of methane within the biogas mixture.

It is used as a light source and fuel, and is the major gas present in Natural Gas and Renewable Natural Gas. Methane is flammable and an explosion hazard.

To minimize the potential for fire should methane leakage occur, flammable gas detectors have been located throughout process operations at Marks.  These flammable gas detectors have been equipped with alarms to the control room as well as local audible and visual alarms set at no greater than 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) indoors and no greater than 20% LEL outdoors, to provide notification well before leakage reaches the flammable/explosive range.
