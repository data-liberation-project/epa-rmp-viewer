This commitment is demonstrated by the numerous measures in place at its warehouse to prevent, detect and/or mitigate an incident involving hazardous materials. Weber Distribution's policy is to implement reasonable measures to prevent a release of hazardous materials from occurring, and to have in place a contingency plan to respond promptly yet safely to such a release.\n\nb.    This RMP has been prepared to address the handling of Toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate and Toluene 2, 6-diisocyanate at the Weber Distribution warehouse located at 13530 Rosecrans Ave., Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670. Weber Distribution receives, stores and reships a variety of products including both regulated and non-regulated chemicals. All chemicals are received in sealed packages approved by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and are reshipped in the same packages. No repackaging takes place. Toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate and Toluene 2, 6-diisocyanate are present together in various toluene diisocyanate (TDI) mixtures which are received in 55 gallon drums. The drums are unloaded at a loading dock dedicated to hazardous materials and moved to a pre-assigned storage location in a special hazardous materials storage room. They are retrieved from storage for reshipment in accordance with written instructions.\n\nc.    The worst case release analyzed was the unconfined spill of the entire contents of a 55 gallon drum of TDI. There is no offsite impact associated with such a release.\n\nd.    The Weber Distribution facility is eligible for a Program 1 RMP and therefore no Prevention Program is required. Never-the-less, there are numerous physical and procedural safeguards in place to prevent and/or mitigate a release. All drums and other shipping containers in which hazardous materials are handled are designed and constructed in accordance with strict DOT specifications. Depending on the s"

      "SummaryText": "pecification, drums may be required to withstand dropping onto concrete from a height of six or more feet without puncturing, splitting or leaking. Hazardous materials storage areas are designed in accordance with strict fire and building code requirements. Only trained personnel familiar with hazardous material storage and handling regulations are involved in the handling of TDI and other hazardous materials.\n\ne.    There have been no accidental releases of any regulated substance in the past five years.\n\nf.    Personnel are trained to recognize and respond safely to hazardous materials emergencies. If a situation arises which can be safely rectified by response other than emergency response under Cal-OSHA Regulations, Title 8, Section 5192, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, they will take appropriate action. Otherwise the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department (SFSFD) will be summoned, neighbors will be notified and the facility will be promptly and safely evacuated.\n\ng.    There are no planned changes to improve safety."
