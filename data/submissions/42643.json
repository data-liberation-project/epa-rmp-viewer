      "SummaryText": "The City of Bloomington owns and operates a lime-softening drinking water treatment plant with the capacity to produce 14 MG of potable water per day. The facility is located in the west central portion of Bloomington. Liquid chlorine is used to disinfect the treated water. The facility has a maximum capacity of 6 one-ton liquid chlorine cylinders, although less is typically stored on-site for a majority of the year. The chemical feed system currently in place is a vacuum type with multiple safety mechanisms. To ensure protection of our employees, neighbors, and the environment, strict policies and procedures are followed when manipulating or handling the chlorine feed system. In the +30 years of operation there has never been a significant chlorine leak at this facility. In the unlikely event that an emergency were to occur, an emergency response plan is in place to minimize an accident's impact."
