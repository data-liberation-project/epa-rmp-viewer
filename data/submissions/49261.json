In this way we promote \noverall plant, worker, and public safety.\n\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the \nconsequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and \nother types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental \nfatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including \nany use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or \ncombination of these activities.  Any group of vessels that are interconnected and \nseparate vessels, which are located, such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a \npotential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and \npractices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These \nrules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and \naccepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nGreen Plains Renewable Energy, INC. operates a 50 million gallon per year ethanol \nproduction facility in Shenandoah, IA.

The prevention program for the ammonia \nprocess was developed to comply with PSM regulations, and was most recently updated \nin the third quarter of 2007.  Updating the PSM program is a continuous process and \nseveral of the PSM program element guidelines and procedures are currently being \nupdated, and will be completed shortly after the RMP submittal due date.  Key provisions \nof the facility release prevention program are as follows:\n\n Employees who operate these systems must receive training initially and periodically on \nsafe startup/shutdown, operations, and emergency shutdown of the processes.  \n Release incidents are investigated, and the results are used to improve the safety of the \nprocess. \n The ammonia system is maintained through the mechanical integrity \nprogram, which minimizes the risk of accident and maximizes process safety. \n Results of incident investigations are also shared with employees who could be affected \nby the process.  \n Employees participated in a process hazard analysis (PHA) which identified potential \nhazards and ways to improve the safety of the process every five years, or whenever \nsignificant changes are made to the process.\n The facility has a management of change (MOC) program in place that mandates that \nchanges to the ammonia system are reviewed prior to implementing the change to ensure \nthat the change would not compromise safety.\n A pre-startup review is also completed after a major change and prior to a new process \ncoming on line.  \n A hot work (spark producing) permit program is in place. \n Contractors who are hired to work on or near the regulated processes must have adequate \ntraining on the hazards prior to starting work.  \n\nFive Year Accident History:\nOffsite consequence analyses need to consider the release history of each process.

However, EPA guidance was followed and toxic \nendpoints were identified for the WCS and the ACS.  ACSs are considered by EPA to be \nmore realistic and useful for emergency response planning than the WCS.\n\nFollowing EPA guidance the largest vessel approach, considering potential passive \nmitigation, was used to estimate the WCS.  The WCS for the facility was identified by \nassuming that the contents of the largest vessel are released in a 10-minute period. The \nlargest vessel in the ammonia refrigeration system is located just South of the main \nprocess building.  This vessel contains a maximum of 74,160 pounds of ammonia \nliquefied under pressure.

The ACS that resulted in the \nlongest distance to the endpoint was selected for presentation in this document and for \nreporting to EPA.
