We react steam and methane (natural gas) to form hydrogen gas, which we then purify compress, and feed into hydrogen pipelines.  The plant was started in 1996 and was initially not believed to be subject to 29 CFR1919.119 or 40 CFR Part 68.  An error in the flammable threshold calculations was discovered in late 2015, with inventory exceed the threshold limits.  Linde has always operated and maintained the process in an OSHA PSM and EPA RMP \"\"compliant\"\" condition.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances:\r\nThis facility uses, manufactures, or stores a chemical listed in part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, beyond a threshold quantity, as established by the EPA. The chemical is:\r\n- Flammable mixture containing hydrogen, methane, and other components, manufactured on site.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy:\r\nLinde is dedicated to being the best performing industrial gas company in all aspects of our business, including safety, health, and environmental affairs. Our safety, health, and environmental policy call for a commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment.\r\n\r\nThis policy is the basis for engineering and construction programs that produce equipment and process systems that minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases and operational safety programs that ensure safe operation of our facilities. Linde is committed to the continuous improvement of these programs.\r\n\r\nLinde is an active member of the American Chemistry Council and subscribes to the council's program of Responsible Care; Employee Health and Safety Code of Management Practices.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\"Prevention Program:\r\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Sulphur, LA facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place.
