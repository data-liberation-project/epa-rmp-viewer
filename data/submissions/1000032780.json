The Water Authority has established safe work methods that employees must practice at all times.\n\n\n\nThe NRV Regional Water Authority Water Treatment Plant complies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations and has policies in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n\n\n2.0  SOURCE AND SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe facility (SIC Code 4941, NAICS 22131) is responsible for treating drinking water for the Towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg, Virginia Tech, and parts of Montgomery County.  Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Services, CAS Number 7782-50-5) and Ammonia (CAS Number 7664-41-7) are used to disinfect treated water prior to distribution. The Water Authority stores on-site up to five one-ton cylinders of Chlorine and up to 6,800 gallons of Ammonia. \n\n\n\n3.0  PURPOSE OF RMP SUBMISSION\n\n\n\nThe RMP was initially prepared and submitted in July 2001.  The purpose of this RMP submission is to update the facility's contact information and any relavant dates within each section enclosed in the plan.\n\n\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and, with this document, the Clean Air Act Accidental Release Prevention Program regulations.

The Plant uses a vacuum chlorine system, and the entire Water Authority staff is trained in the repair of leaking and/or ruptured chlorine cylinders or transmission lines.  The Water Authority has a gas scrubber for added safety that will capture any chlorine released from the chlorine cylinders in the chlorine storage room.  The ammonia system has secondary containment and the entire Water Authority staff is trained in the clean-up of any spills that may occur.  The Water Authority has coordinated efforts with the local fire department to supply additional emergency equipment.  An outside agency is notified if needed.\n\n \n\n7.0  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Water Authority Water Treatment Plant has an ongoing maintenance training and operational training program to continuously update operator knowledge of systems within their facility."
