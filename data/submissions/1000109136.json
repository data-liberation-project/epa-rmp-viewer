MARPLOT was used to overlay the impact area on a map and estimate the population impacted within the endpoints of the WCS. \nThe MARPLOT version 5.1.1 was used to produce the impact area overlays and estimate the population impacted, which uses 2010 census data. Satellite imagery of area from 2023 was reviewed and it was determined that no additional residential developments were within the WCS impact area. \nThe WCS impact area was determined to be 0.2 miles. Within 0.2 miles, there are no sensitive receptors, and therefore, no impacted populations. \n\n1.2.5 Program 1 Determination\nPer 40 CFR \u00a7 68.10 (g), the 29% Aqua Ammonia process at the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station site is eligible for Program 1 requirements as provided in \u00a7 68.12(b) as it meets all of the following requirements:\n(1)\tFor the five years prior to the submission of this RMP, the process has not had an accidental release of 29% aqua ammonia\n(2)\tThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release assessment conducted under subpart B and \u00a7 68.25 is less than the distance to any public receptor, as defined in \u00a7 68.3; and \n(3)\tEmergency response procedures have been coordinated between the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station facility and the local emergency planning and response organizations."

      "SummaryText": "29.5% solution in water. The aqueous ammonia is stored in a vessel onsite. EPA\u0092s Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule lists the threshold quantity for aqueous ammonia at 20% concentration or greater to be 20,000 lbs. The aqueous ammonia vessel could store a maximum of 239,391 lbs. OSHA\u0092s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard specifies a threshold quantity for ammonia solutions greater than 44% by weight. Therefore, the facility is covered by the RMP Rule, and not covered by the PSM standard.\n\nThe characteristics and hazards of methane are described in the following section (Section 1.2.3).\n\n1.2.3 Characteristics and Hazards of Ammonia and Safeguards Applied\n\nAqueous ammonia is a colorless alkaline liquid with a pungent odor. Although generally considered a weak base, aqueous ammonia reacts violently with most acids. It forms explosive compounds with mercury, silver oxide, and other compounds of silver. It corrodes many metals. With the halogens, it forms the shock-sensitive, explosive nitrogen trihalides. With household bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution) it forms toxic and explosively unstable chloramines. The concentration of ammonia in the air above solutions of aqueous ammonia can be within the explosive limits for ammonia (15\u009628%). \n\nAqueous ammonia is considered toxic to humans. Aqueous ammonia can cause severe skin burns and eye damage. Ammonia vapor may displace oxygen and cause rapid suffocation. Inhalation of ammonia vapor may cause respiratory irritation. \nTo reduce the risk of ammonia leaks at the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station site, a comprehensive safety strategy has been implemented. This strategy encompasses inherently safe design principles, pressure relief systems, administrative safeguards, and thorough operator training. These measures are essential in maintaining safety and preventing ammonia-related incidents.\n\n1.2.4 Worst Case Scenario\nTo perform the offsite consequence analysis for the J. Wayne Leonard Power Station site, EPA\u0092s wastewater tr"
