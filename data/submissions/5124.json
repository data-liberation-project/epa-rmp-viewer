Each of these is discussed here.\n\nChlorine is used as an integral part in one of the South Area Operation's mills for the purpose of mercury extraction and recovery. The EPA's reporting quantity for chlorine is 2,500 pounds. At present Newmont stores 3,000 pounds in 150-pound cylinders at one of its warehouses. The \"worst case release\" scenario as shown by EPA's RMP  air dispersion model, and confirmed by JBR Environmental Consultants, Inc., would be a radius of eight tenths of a mile. Newmont owns or controls property for a 2.7 mile radius miles from the source location to the nearest \"public receptor\" (one house), and is therefore confident that any accidental release would be inconsequential to the public.\n\nAmmonia in the form ammonium hydroxide is used as an integral part of one Newmont's South Area Operations gold leaching processes through a patented extraction process. The EPA's reporting quantity for ammonia is 20,000 pounds. At present Newmont stores up to 30,000 gallons of ammonium hydroxide at one leach process area. The \"worst case release\" scenario as shown by EPA's RMP  air dispersion model, and confirmed by JBR Environmental Consultants, Inc., would be a radius of 2.0 miles. Again, Newmont owns or controls the land for a 2.8 mile radius from the source location to the nearest \"public receptor\" (one house), and is therefore confident that any accidental release would be inconsequential to the public.  \n\nAs a part of the ongoing safety training conducted by Newmont's Loss Control Department, all employees in the afore-mentioned areas are periodically trained in evacuation procedures should a release of these substances occur. In conjunction with any evacuation that might be necessitated due to a release or spill, 24 hour on-call phone lines have been established with not only the Loss Control Department, but also the Environmental Department and the Security Departmen"

A number of accidental release and emergency response policies are implemented and recognized as daily practices to insure our commitment to safety and implementation of safe procedures.  As such, Newmont Mining's Carlin South Area Operations has adopted the following Loss Control Policy Statement: \n\n\"It is the policy of Newmont Mining Corporation that we will produce gold in an efficient manner, in harmony with the environment, while protecting the safety and health of our employees.\n\nNewmont Mining Corporation will comply with all government regulations. Newmont recognizes government regulations as minimum standards and in many situations will establish internal standards, which will exceed the government requirements.\n\nNewmont believes that the safety and health functions can be managed proactively and will develop, implement and maintain safe working policies, procedures, practices, rules, guidelines, standards, etc. and develop a management system that is concerned with the safety and health of each and every individual.\n\nAll of us working at Newmont must strive to make the Carlin Operations a safer and better place to work.  Newmont will hold each employee responsible, within the bounds of his/her control, for the maintenance of safe and healthy working conditions; for compliance with safety, health, environmental regulations and company procedures, and to do their job in a safe and efficient manner.\"\n\nWith this commitment Newmont recognizes that our safety procedures are also meant to assure the surrounding community the same degree of safety assurances.\n\nIn Addition to Loss Control's Policy Statement, The Mission Statement of the Environmental Department is as follows:\n\n\"Mission Statement for Environmental Compliance\n\nThe intent of N"

However, as a leader in innovative technologies, the use of two substances above EPA threshold reporting quantities has proven to be invaluable for gold extraction. Each of these substances is used in minimum quantities to produce maximum economic results, and both substances are located in remote areas that do not have potential impact to public receptors.\n\nTo verify the possible impact, or lack thereof, Newmont Carlin Operations enlisted the services of JBR Environmental Consultants Inc. to verify Newmont Carlin Operations Environmental Department's conclusions that the public receptors would not be compromised in a \"worst case release\".\n\nThe two substances found to be above storage thresholds for"

In a case of substantial release, area supervisors have been instructed, at a minimum, that the Loss Control Department and Environmental Department should be contacted immediately. Loss Control will make the decision as to whether the Security Department and Local Emergency Planning Committee should be contacted. The Environmental Department would be responsible for alerting either the appropriate EPA or NDEP agencies if this should be necessary.\n\nNewmont Mining Corporation prides itself on the high degree of safety and environmental training classes that all employees have been exposed to. As a result,  in the last 5 years there have been no accidents resulting in either injury or death to any onsite or offsite individuals from any of the listed 112-R substances that Newmont has used over that period of time.\n\nThe Newmont Carlin Operations Emergency Response Plan addresses fire, chemical, medical, and earthquake emergencies, as well as upset conditions. It discusses evacuation of specific areas and a general evacuation of the plant site. Newmont has signed a mutual aid agreement with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and participates in annual drills set up by the LEPC. Our emergency response teams train on a monthly basis and are proficient in handling chemical spills, fires, confined space and high angle rescues on the property. In addition, they have been called on a number of occasions to respond to off-site chemical and petroleum spills. There are 23 Hazardous Material technicians among emergency response members who are trained to the 40-hour level and who receive a minimum of 8 hours of training on a yearly basis. While other identities in the Elko area have Hazardous Material trained individuals, at present Newmont has the only Hazardous Material Teams in the county.\n\nIn addition, as a part of the \"Emergency Response Team Charter\" at Newmont South Area Operations:\n\nThe Emergency Response Team will consist of a minimum of eight people on each"

In this regard, and as an outcome of investigations performed while complying with 112-R, Newmont is re-evaluating our stock on hand of Chlorine. Mill Operations has been asked to look at the necessity of having 3,000 pounds of chlorine on hand at the warehouse at any one time. It is hoped that more frequent deliveries of lesser amounts will minimize risk at the facility.  \n\nFinally, Newmont South Area Operations requires that all new inventory items have any associated MSDS reviewed by both the Loss Control and Environmental Departments prior to any product and subsequent amounts being shipped on site. In addition to this, our Purchasing Department is presently being made aware 112-R substance threshold process limits to further minimize chemical risks.\n\nNewmont South Area Operations looks forward to maintaining excellence in its Risk Management Program through all available resources."
