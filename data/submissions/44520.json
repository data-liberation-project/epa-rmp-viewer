      "SummaryText": "\nExecutive Summary         \n\nThe DAP Inc. Tipp City facility operates an aerosol propellant charging system in Tipp City, Ohio. \n\n This system is composed of two 18623-gallon bulk tanks (Tank 14 and Tank 15) containing Aeron NP-70 used for charging aerosol paint cans.  One 8000 gallon bulk tank (Tank 16) containing a mixture of 62% Aeron NP-70 and 32% DME will be used for propellant charging of in Daptex aerosol foam cans.  One 4000 gallon bulk tank of 100% DME is used for charging a relatively few aerosol paint cans.  Additionally, there are two gashouses that hold the aerosol gas charging equipment.  One gashouse is used for charging aerosol paint cans, while the other gashouse is used for charging Daptex aerosol foam cans.  \n\nThe Aeron NP-70 in Tank 14 and Tank 15 is composed of: Propane (CAS # 74-98-6), n-Butane (CAS # 106-97-8), and Isobutane   (CAS# 75-28-5) \n\nThe Aeron NP-70/DME Blend in Tank 16 is composed of Propane (CAS # 74-98-6), n-Butane (CAS # 106-97-8), and Dimethyl Ether (CAS # 115-10-6) \n\nThe DME in tank 17 is composed of  Dimethyl Ether (CAS # 115-10-6) \n\n\n\nDAP Inc. Tipp City has written this plan to provide for accidental release prevention and risk management planning required by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990 amended Section 112 of the Act and added paragraph (r).  The intent of Section 112(r) is to prevent accidental releases to the air and mitigate the consequences of such releases by focusing prevention measures on chemicals that pose the greatest risk to the public and the environment.   This list of regulated substances includes butane, isobutane, propane and dimethyl ether.  Stationary sources covered by these regulations must develop and implement a Risk Management Program that includes a hazard assessment, a prevention program, and an emergency response program.  These elements are to be described in an RMP that must be registered with EPA, submitted to state and local authorities, and made available to the public.  On June 20, 19"

      "SummaryText": "96, EPA promulgated these regulations (61 FR 31668), referred to as the RMP rule.  The State of Ohio codified these regulations in Ohio Administrative Code Chapter 3745-104, which is termed the Ohio Accidental Release Prevention Program.  \n\n.  Processes subject to these requirements are divided into three tiers, labeled Programs 1, 2 and 3. Program 3 applies to processes in any of nine specified Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes or processes subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), unless the process is eligible for Program 1.  All other covered processes must satisfy Program 3 requirements.  As will be shown in Section 5, the distance to the flammable endpoint for the worst-case release scenario reaches a public receptor, and the process is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  Based on these criteria, the DAP Inc. Tipp City aerosol propellant process meets Program 3 eligibility requirements.  \n\nAs a Program 3 facility, the owner/operator must:\n\na. Prepare worst case and alternative case release scenarios and maintain a 5-year incident history.  \n\nb. Prepare a release prevention program including process safety information, pha's, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audits, develop management of change program, develop a mechanical integrity program, complete incident investigations, develop a contractor program, develop employee participation, and a hot work program.  \n\nc. Maintain an emergency response program. \n\nd.  Submit a Risk Management Plan to OEPA.  \n\nThe DAP Inc. Tipp City facility policy to comply with all regulations.    \n\nDistances to a 1-psi overpressure were calculated using equations from the EPA OCA guidance documents.  The worst case scenarios calculated were for a rupture of one of the NP-70, NP-70/DME blend, or DME tanks to rupture, find an ignition source, and create a vapor cloud explosion.  The alternative scenario calculated was for a 500-ga"
