If an accidental \r\nrelease should occur; the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other \r\nauthorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.Facility Information\r\nThis facility has been newly equipped and approved for the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored would be 138,720 pounds storage tanks and nurse tanks.\r\n\r\n3 Accidental (Worse-Case) and Alternate Release Scenario\r\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 52,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.0 miles.\r\n\r\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is <.25 miles.\r\n\r\n4  Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\" and Kansas Commercial Fertilizer Law (K.S.A.[1997 Supp.] 2-1201).\r\n\r\n5  The Five-Year Accident History\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\n\t-have caused any"
