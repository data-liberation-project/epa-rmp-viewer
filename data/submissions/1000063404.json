ERP makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:  \n\n\n\nThe Beth Station Preparation Plant utilizes anhydrous ammonia for pH control in order to allow for maximum washing efficiency.  The tanks are located adjacent to the plant on the hillside in a mountainous rural setting.  The 7 employees mentioned in the application work one daily shift.  The maximum number of employees at the plant is anticipated to be 7.  For more information, you may contact the Plant Manager.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\n\n\nThis facility is operated in accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place along with written operating procedures.  The management system procedures ensure training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  \n\n\n\nERP Environmental Fund, Inc. maintains a 24-hour guard at the facility that would enable the facility to quickly coordinate emergency resp"

This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency. \n\n \n\nFive-Year Accident History: The Beth Station Preparation Plant has never had a release of anhydrous ammonia that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact. \n\n  \n\nThe Emergency Response Program:  Our employees will not respond to accidental releases of the regulated substance but will rely on the local emergency responders when there is a need for response.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:  Our facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions. We make changes to improve safety based on comments and information developed within our organization and the industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design."
