Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe at Sysco Food Services of Ventura, Inc. are committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforseeable, if such a release does occur, our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with the Oxnard Fire Department, who provides our emergency response services.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nWe have one regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous).  The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility, based on process/operational requirements, is 9,950 pounds.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required off-site consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the RMP Comp program provided by the EPA.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxic Worst Case Analysis:\n\nThe Worst Care scenario involves a catastrophic release from Sysco Food Services of Ventura, Inc.  The scenario involves the release of 9,950 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) in a liquid and gaseous form over 10 minutes.  The release rate (lbs/min) is calculated to be 995 and a distance to endpoint of 1.4 miles is obtained which affects a residential population of 46,143 with"
