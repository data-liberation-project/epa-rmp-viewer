The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Minster Farmers Cooperative Exchange are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the various fire departments, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as fertilizer for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 84,118 pounds in our one 18,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario And The Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,118 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 56 percent capacity by weight as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 2.2 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident (no accidents occurred in the previous five-year accident history), is a release from or a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.92 mile.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage And Handling Of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  The facility has also "

      "SummaryText": "complied with the \"Regulations For Storing And Handling Fertilizer Anhydrous Ammonia\" as regulated by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.\n\n5. The Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has:\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n- a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
