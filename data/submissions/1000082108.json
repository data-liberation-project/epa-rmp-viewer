This standard is often referred to as the risk management program rule. The facility is covered by the rule because it processes propane in excess of the regulatory thresholds. Propane is transferred and stored at the facility and is a listed chemical due to flammability.  The Manly Terminal, LLC facility is a product storage and transfer facility.\n\n\n\nAccording to the risk management program rule, covered facilities must develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the EPA with updates every five years. The covered facilities must also revise and update the RMP when certain events occur, such as the addition of a new process containing a regulated substance above its threshold quantity. The RMP must include registration information, a summary of the risk management program, and a certification statement. The RMP will be made available to the public. The purpose of this project was to compile an updated RMP.\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was conducted on a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario involving propane. The analysis of the worst-case release scenario assumed that a total release of a railcar's contents resulting in a release of 128,000 pounds of propane to the atmosphere. The resulting plume was modeled according to the method presented in the EPA's RMP*Comp. The overpressure point of 1 PSI was determined to be 0.4 miles. It was further determined through knowledge of the area that within 0.4 miles of the facility there is a population of approximately 10 people. There were no public receptors identified within 0.4 miles of the facility other than the residences.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario examined a vapor cloud explosion from a total release of a semi tanker truck contents. In this scenario, 36,570 pou"

The population within 0.2 miles of the facility was determined to be zero. There were no public or environmental receptors identified within 0.2 miles of the facility.\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analyses data and information concerning the facility and the facility's implementation of the risk management program are included in the offsite consequence analysis report.\n\n\n\nThere were no accidents for this process in the 5-year history.\n\n\n\nThe facility takes steps to improve safety at the facility by performing monthly/annual internal site inspections and regular training.   \n\n"
