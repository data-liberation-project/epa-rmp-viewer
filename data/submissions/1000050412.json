The facility is located on 4113 Four Mile Road.  This facility consists of two plants: a resin plant that was originally constructed in 1986 and a plant that manufactures formaldehyde, which is one of the basic raw materials used to manufacture the resins.  The formaldehyde plant was constructed in 1990.  Both of these processes contain a raw material tank farm, the process equipment itself and a finished product tank farm.  Overall, the facility employs 21 full-time employees.\r\n\t\r\n\tGP is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe risk management program at the Plant consists of the following three elements:\r\n\t\r\n\tHazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\r\n\t\r\n\tPrevention program to help"

GP implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the Plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\r\n\t\r\n\tIn the event of an accidental release, the Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GP provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  In order to effectively implement these policies, GP established a management system headed by the Safety Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n1.2\t  Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n\tThe plant handles two (2) regulated substances in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule; Formaldehyde and Aqua Ammonia (Concentration 20% or greater).\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n1.3\t  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n\tSince 1986, the Plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  GP makes available information concerning hazardous substances to all employees, the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC), the Beaver Creek Fire Department, and Mercy Hospital when requested or as needed in the event of an emergency.\r\n\t\r\n\tSafety Data Sheets (SDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\r\n\t\r\n\u00b7\ttoxicity information and permissible exposure limits\r\n\u00b7\tphysical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\r\n\u00b7\treactivity and corrosivity data\r\n\u00b7\tthermal and chemical stability data \r\n\u00b7\thazards of mixing substances in the process \r\n\t\r\n\tSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the process control room so that the operators have ready reference to this information.  In addition, SDSs are made available to the LEPC and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters"

Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures.\r\n\t\r\n\t1.3.1.11   Hot Work Permits - The Plant established a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the plant.  The plant reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the plants safe work practices orientation.\r\n\t\r\n\t1.3.1.12   Contractors - The Plant established a program to help ensure that contractor activities at the plant are performed in a safe manner.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that the plant only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  The plant explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plants safe work practices, and the plants emergency response procedures.  The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees who will work at the plant before that worker begins work at the plant site.  The plant periodically reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed.\r\n\t\r\n1.3.2\t  Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n\tIn addition to the required prevention program elements, the Plant has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the plant.
