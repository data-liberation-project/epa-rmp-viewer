WE HAVE A A OFFSITE RESPONCE PLAN WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEPC.  ALL OF OUR EMPLOYES ARE UP TO DAE ON THIS PROCEDURE.   YOUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED:  THE ONLY THING THAT OUR FACILITY HAS IS A AMMONIA TANK THAT WE SELL THE THE FARMERS FOR CORN PRODUCTION.  WE DO NOT PROCESSS THIS MATERIAL, WE JUST RETAIL THE MATERIAL TO THE FARMERS.  WE HANDLE ABOUT 55 TON A YEAR OF THIS PRODUCT.      THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:  FOR OUR WORST CASE IT WOULD IMPACT THE ENVIROMENT A VERY LITTLE.  WE ARE A SMALL COMMUNITY WITH FARMS AROUND.  THERE IS NO INDUSTRTAL AROUND US SO THAT IMPACT WOULD BE NONE.  WE NEVER CARRY MORE THAN 28 TON OF PRODUCT AT ONE TIME.  WE HAVE NO MEANS OF CONTROL MECHANISMS LIKE ALARMS OR SENSORS ON THE TANK.  IT IS A VISUAL THEN DONE DAILEY.THE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  THE HAVE A MAINTANCE STAFF THAT TAKES CARE OF THE SYSTEM IF THERE IS A PROBLEM.  WE MUST DO THINGS ACCORDING TO OSHA RULES.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:   WE HAVE HAD NO ACCIDENTS IN PAST FIVE YEARS.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONCE PROGRAM:  THIS IS DONE BY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEPC OF MISSAUKEE CO.  THEY TRAIN EVERY YEAR WITH US REGUARDING A LEAK OR SPILL.  OUR EMERGENCY RESPONCE IS PUBLISHED IN THE LOCAL PAPER EVERY YEAR.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  A THIS POINT WE REALLY DON'T PLAN ON CHANGING ANY OF OUR SAFTEY MEASURES.  WE HAVE MONTHLEY SAFETY MEETINGS AND THE LEPC VISITS US EVERY YEAR TO REVIEW OUR PLANS.  WE FEEL IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH THE LEPC TO HELP WITH THESE SAFETY SYSTEMS."
