      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical and Manufacturing Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Diversified CPC International, Inc are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass loading/unloading and storage of propellants used in the aerosol and foaming industries.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Propane and Butane.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for an aerosol propellant and foaming agent.  Propane is used for an aerosol propellant.  Butane is used for an aerosol propellant and foaming agent.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] that is expected to be present in this facility based on process/operational  requirements is 399750.00 lb. while Propane and Butane are expected to be present at our facility in quantities of 335500.00 lb. and 323750.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Normal Butane.  In this scenario 145000 lb. of Butane is rel"

      "SummaryText": "eased.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.42 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 84650.98 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.22 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Isobutane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 48214.77 lb. of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.15 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Normal Butane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 37526.99 lb. of Butane in 10 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.12 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDiv"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 02/08/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Diversified CPC International, Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, t"
