      "SummaryText": "a.    The Englewood Water District water treatment facility was installed to chlorinate water for Charlotte County, Englewood service subscribers.  The facility is located at 140 Telman Road.  The station includes a chlorine storage area, which contains liquid chlorine containers, chlorinators, and various types of related safety equipment.  A maximum of 4 one-ton containers of chlorine are found in the chlorine storage area (two on-line and two for backup.)  One 2 ton-cylinder is connected to the chlorination system on site at any given time.  The facility is occupied staffed 16 hours a day 7 days a week and on call 24 hours a day, and qualifies as a Program 3 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines.\n\nb.    The Englewood Water District accidental release prevention program at the Telman Road facility involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and adheres to all applicable procedures of EPA.  The Englewood Water District emergency response program is in compliance with EPA Emergency Response Program (?ERP?) requirements.\n\nc.    The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as ?worst-case release? and ?alternative release.?  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that, ?the owner or operator shall assume that the?maximum quantity in the largest vessel?is released as a gas over 10 minutes,? due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as ?more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.?\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling must be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the ?toxic endpoint? selected by EPA of 3 parts per million (?ppm?), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (?ERPG-2?).  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (?AIHA?) as the ?maximum airborne concentration below wh"

      "SummaryText": "ich it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual?s ability to take protective action.?  The residential population within a circle corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance must be defined, ?to estimate the population potentially affected.?\n\ni.    The worst-case release scenario at the Telman facility involves a failure of a single one-ton cylinder (2,000 lb) connected to the chlorination system.  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for two sets of conditions.  The first set followed conditions pre-defined by EPA, namely release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance.  EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis; however, the assumptions used may be unrealistic because:\n\n\n(a)     It is not appropriate to compare a 10-minute release to a one-hour average standard.  The 3 ppm one-hour ERPG value can be modified using available time of exposure/concentration relationships to match the ten-minute release time; the value obtained is 7.3 ppm.  Thus a secondary toxic endpoint of 7 ppm was also considered during interpretation of the results of the 10-minute worst-case release.\n\n(b)    Only the population within an elliptical plume extending downwind of the release point is potentially affected.  This plume area, or footprint, is approximately 6.25% of the area of the full circle.\n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, highest daily maximum temperature (96oF), and average relative humidity (74%) were inputs for analysis of both toxic endpoints.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst-case s"

      "SummaryText": "cenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 3.6 miles and an estimate of residential population affected of 4,386 was obtained.  When the same modeling was performed with the second set of conditions, namely a 10-minute average ERPG-2 of 7 ppm and consideration of the plume footprint only, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.9 miles and an estimate of population potentially affected of 96 resulted.\n\nii.  The alternative release scenario involves tank failure and partial release of 1 of the one-ton cylinders connected to the chlorination system.  The amount of chlorine released is 2,000 lb over 60 minutes.  Typical meteorological conditions were used: atmospheric stability of D, wind speed of 3.7 m/s, average air temperature of 72.2oF, and 74% relative humidity.  The estimated distance to a toxic endpoint of 3 ppm was 1.5 miles.  The estimated population affected was 643 within a full circle of 1.5-mile radius and 11 within the plume footprint.\n    \nd.    The Englewood Water District accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n?    High level training of the operators\n?    Preventive maintenance program\n?    Use of industry standard process and safety equipment\n?    Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n?    Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n\nChlorine-specific prevention steps include:\n\n?    Training in the practices of safe chlorine handling\n?    The availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators \n?    Awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n?    Presence of chlorine detectors.\n\ne.    No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf.
