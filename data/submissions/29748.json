      "SummaryText": "Allied Chemical LLC has a plan in place to prevent the discharge of oleum from the plant property.  The most likely scenario for a leak would be if a pump or hose leaks during the transfer of the oleum from the storage tank to the reactor, M-1.  If a leak were to occur, the RMP data suggest that it would be confined to the Allied property.  Allied will take all necessary steps to immediately stop production and to contain any acid spill.  Emergency equipment includes gogging spray headers for water hoses, eye washes and manual shut-off valves for the hoses.  There is also an emergency shut-down switch for the pump in the truck loading area.  There are no public receptors within two miles of the property line."
