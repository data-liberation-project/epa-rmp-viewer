The facility stores, cools and ships harvested agricultural products and employs approximately 60 persons at this location. \n\nNunes Cooling has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  Nunes Cooling's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substance.\n\n \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe facility utilizes ammonia for refrigeration. The system is defined as a closed loop system.  Approximately 27,920 lbs of ammonia are contained in the ammonia refrigeration system respectively.  The system runs approximately half of the year.  During the downseason, major maintenance issues are handled to ensure the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\n\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the ammonia refrigeration system.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\n\n\nRisk Considerations:\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community; Nunes Cooling has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and facility personnel to mak"

      "SummaryText": "e this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analysis appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent. Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly than is shown in the model).\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that over-predict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n-  There are process valves to permit isolation of any leaks in place.\n\n-  The system undergoes scheduled maintenance to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic failures.\n\n-  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is used by facility personnel, as necessary.\n\nThe history of Nunes Cooling (i.e., no RMP-applicable ammonia releases in the last five years) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the facility staff in safely operating the refrigeration systems.\n\n \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Nunes Cooling to manage process safety issues associated with the use of ammonia. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n \n\nA?68.65    Process Safety Information (PSI) \n\nA?68.67    Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA?68.69 Operating Procedures (OP)\n\nA?68.71    Training (TRN)\n\nA?68.73    Mechanical Integrity (MI)\n\nA?68.75    Management of Change (MOC)\n\nA?68.77    Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\nA?68.79    Compliance Audits (CA)\n\nA?68.81    Incident Investigation (II)\n\nA?68.83    Employee Participation (EP)\n\nA?68.85    Hot Work Permit (HWP)\n\nA?68.87    Contractors (CO)\n\nA?68.90    Emergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\n\n\n    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of ammonia at the fac"
