These plastics are used to manufacture consumer products such as milk bottles, plastic piping, and other plastic products.\n\nThe manufacture of high density polyethylene plastics at the Orange, Texas Facility require the use of the following regulated chemicals:\n\nEthylene - Ethylene gas (CAS 74-85-1) is the primary raw material in the manufacture of low density and high density polyethylene plastics.  Ethylene molecules polymerize under the presence of a catalyst or an initiator to form polyethylene.\n\nIsopentane - Isopentane (CAS 78-78-4)  is used to prepare a catalyst mixture which is used in the manufacture of  high density polyethylene.\n\nIsobutane - Isobutane (CAS 75-28-5) is a diluent or carrier agent used in the manufacture of high density polyethylene.  This substance is not generally involved in the chemical polymerization reaction.\n\nN-Hexene - Hexene (CAS 592-41-6) is used in the high density polyethylene manufacturing process as a comonomer in the process. \n\nQuantities Handled or Stored\n\nIsopentane:   210,000 lbs\nEthylene:   120,000 lbs\nIsobutane:   575,000 lbs\nn-Hexene - 440,000 lbs.\n\nWORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nToxic Worse Case Scenario:\nThe Chevron Phillips Chemical Company -  Orange, manufacturing facility has no listed toxics above Threshold Quantity.

These include plastics, adhesives, paints, fuel additives, and agricultural chemicals just to name a few.  The manufacture of many of these products unavoidably uses substances regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule (40 CFR 68).  In using, storing  and handling these regulated substances, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company's Orange, Texas facility recognizes the potential for community and environmental receptors exposure.  Because of concern over the potential impacts of accidental releases to the community and the environment, the Orange, Texas Facility's Management is committed to full compliance with the requirements of the EPA RMP Rule.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company's Orange, Texas Facility management demonstrates its commitment to safety and the environment by following  Tenents of Operation(tm).  \n-Work Safely Or Not At All \n-There Is Always Time To Do It Right \n-If It's Worth Doing, Do It Better \n1. Never operate equipment outside of design or environmental limits. \n2. Always move to a safe, controlled condition and seek assistance when a situation is not understood. \n3. Always operate with safety and environmental protection devices enabled. \n4. Always follow all safe/environmental work practices/procedures and act to stop unsafe conditions/actions immediately. \n5. Always produce a product that meets or exceeds your customers' requirements. \n6. Never contaminate or compromise a dedicated system. \n7.

      "SummaryText": "Orange, Texas facility.\n\nFlammable Worse Case Scenario:\nThe Worst Case and Alternate Case Flammable scenarios for the Orange, Texas facility have changed due to the removal of 1-butene from our plant.\nThe worst case flammable scenario by EPA definition is a vapor cloud explosion of the single vessel with the greatest amount of flammable material.  For the Orange plant, the vessel with the potentially largest quantity of flammable material is V-501, containing 240,000 lbs. of isobutane.  Using the EPA look-up tables, the distance to a 1.0 psi blast overpressure is predicted to have off site impacts. \n\n\n\nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nToxic Alternative Release Scenario\n\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LP - Orange Chemical Plant has no listed toxic materials above Threshold Quantity.\n\n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenario\n\nSome specific scenarios that were analyzed include:\n\n1. Release of a flammable material and forming a flammable vapor cloud\n2. Release of a flammable material and igniting, which forms a jet fire.\n3. Vapor cloud explosion, with a lower yield factor than for worst case.  \n4. BLEVE, (Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion).\n\nThe above scenarios were analyzed for all the flammable materials,  (isopentane, ethylene, isobutane, & propane).  Scenarios types 1 & 2 did not go off-site and would not be candidates for submitting as an alternative release scenario.  It was decided that a VCE would be a more likely incident, (even though a very low probability), than a BLEVE.  The vessel with the longest distance for a vapor cloud explosion is V-501, with a quantity of 51,270 gallons.  The calculated distance to a 1.0 psi blast overpressure is predicted to have off site impacts.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility complies with the requirements of the OSHA PSM Standard (29 CFR 1910.119).  The management systems used to comply with the OSHA PSM requirements comprise the accidental release prevention program for this facility.\n\nIn g"
