Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of CALAMCO, Port of Stockton Terminal facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 2323 Port Road G, Stockton, California, 95203 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous materials.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\na. The primary activity at the Facility is the receipt, storage and shipment of anhydrous ammonia, and production, storage and shippment of ammonium hydroxide.\n\nb. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application to the soil and for blending into mixed grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia is shipped for use in the refrigeration and power generation industries.\n\nc. Anhydrous ammonia is received via ocean-going ship and stored in two above ground tanks at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled is 80,000,000 pounds.\n\nd. Anhydrous ammonia destined for refrigeration use is stored in four aboveground pressurized vessels.  A three additional aboveground pressurized vesselsare used for agricultural grade anhydrous ammonia storage.\n\ne. Ammonium hydroxide, or aqua ammonia, is blended on-site and stored in one above ground tank.  The maximum quantity of ammonium hydroxide handled is 4,162,670 pounds.\n\n3.Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia: The Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure "

OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38;\nb. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120; and\nc. Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code\nd. 33 CFR Part 127 \n\n6.Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this Facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific planned changes to the anhydrous ammonia and aqua ammonia processes at the facility at this time."
