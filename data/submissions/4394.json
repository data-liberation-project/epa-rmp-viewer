The Facility treats water drawn from Claremore\nLake to drinking water standards for residential and industrial use.  The Facility uses\none (1) regulated substance (chlorine) above the threshold quantity of  the Risk\nManagement Program rule (40 CFR 68).  Facilities that use or store any toxic or\nflammable substances listed in 40 CFR 68.130 above the specified threshold quantities\nin a process, are required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program\nenforced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \n\nThe goal of this Risk Management Program is to prevent an accidental release of\nchlorine that could potentially cause harm to the public and/or the environment, and to\nmitigate the severity of any release that does occur. The Risk Management Program\nincludes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a\nfive-year accident history, a release prevention program and an emergency response\nprogram. \n\nThe Facility has never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries,\nproperty or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the chlorine system, the Facility's emergency\naction plan requires an immediate evacuation of the Facility and immediate notification\nof the Claremore Fire Department.  The Claremore Fire Department will be responsible\nfor responding to the emergency and directing any required public evacuation or\nsheltering in place.  The Facility has discussed this Emergency Response Plan with the\nClaremore Fire Department and members of the Claremore Fire Department have\ninspected the Facility.  The Claremore Fire Department has the necessary equipment\nrequired to seal a leak in a chlorine ton-container.  They are also equipped with self\ncontained breathing apparatus (SCBA) that would enable them to enter the Chlorine\nRoom and work to"

Under this program the Facility has compiled process safety\ninformation and performed a process hazard analysis, developed and implemented\nwritten operating procedures and trained the employees that operate or maintain the\nchlorine system.  The Facility has also implemented maintenance and inspection\nprocedures to ensure the mechanical integrity of the chlorine system's equipment.  Prior\nto implementing any change to the chlorine system, a management of change\nprocedure will be adhered to including a pre-startup review of the chlorine system.  The\nFacility will perform a compliance audit every three (3) years and will investigate all\nactual releases and any incident that could have resulted in a release.  The Facility has\ninvolved its employees in the development of the Facility's Risk Management Program. \nThe Facility requires the use of hot work permits involving any welding or other heat \ngenerating work either on or near to the chlorine system, and has implemented\nprocedures for training of contractors and verifying contractors' qualifications.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine stored at the Facility is approximately 4,000 pounds\ncontained in the two (2) chlorine ton-containers and associated piping, valves and other\nmiscellaneous equipment.  The chlorine equipment is housed in a building.  However,\nthe ton-containers are delivered by truck and are offloaded outside of the Chlorine\nRoom.  The worst-case release scenario for chlorine would be an accident during\noffloading resulting in the rupture of one (1) chlorine ton-container and the release of its\nentire contents over a ten (10) minute period.

Based on the\nCompliance Guidance and Model Risk Management Program for  Water Treatment\nPlants (WTP Guidance) prepared by the American Water Works Association (AWWA)\nand the EPA,  the distance from the Facility to the point where the chlorine\nconcentration has diminished to 3 ppm is 3.1 miles.  This distance is known as the\nend-point distance.  The area of potential impact is defined as a circle with its center\npoint at the Facility and extending outward to the end-point distance, in this case 3.1\nmiles.  1990 census data as calculated by the LandView  III program indicate that\napproximately 4,700 people live within this area of potential impact.  The Claremore\nQuadrangle U.S.Geological Survey 7.5 Minute Series Topographic map (Claremore\nQuadrangle map), a DeLorme Street Atlas USA  street map (DeLorme map), and the\nMARPLOT  map indicate the area of potential impact contains at least one school,\nresidence, hospital, park, jail, and commercial, office, or industrial area.  A review of the\nClaremore Quadrangle, the DeLorme map, and the MARPLOT  map failed to identify\nany sensitive environmental receptors with the area of potential impact.\n\nA more realistic release scenario known as the alternative-case release scenario was\nidentified in a process hazard analysis (PHA) of the Facility's chlorine system.  This\nrelease would be much smaller than the worst-case release, and it was estimated that it\ncould be contained within one (1) hour or less by the Claremore Fire Department.  This\nrelease could occur if an operator failed to properly attach the regulator to the chlorine\nton-container's valve, and  then opened  the valve.  This would cause a release of\nchlorine through the open valve at a maximum sustained rate of 10.7 lb/min.  This\nwould immediately cause a very high concentration of chlorine in the Chlorine Room\nrequiring the operator to immediately evacuate the chlorine building and implement the\nFacility's emergency action plan.

It is anticipated that the Claremore Fire Department would use\nSCBA to enter the Chlorine Room and close the valve.  Using the WTP Guidance for a\n10.7 lb/min chlorine release over a 60 minute time period, the endpoint distance is\ndetermined to be 0.56 miles.
