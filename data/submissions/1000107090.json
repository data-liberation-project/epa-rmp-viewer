Prior to selecting a contractor, TVA evaluates the qualifications of the contractor including their safety performance. Procedures are in place to ensure that contractors are properly informed of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the process involved, including the emergency response procedures in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nIV. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere was an accident on June 3, 2014. \n\nV. Emergency Response Plan\n\nTVA has an emergency response plan in place to respond to accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes\nall aspects of emergency response plan requirements including adequate first aid and medical treatment, safe shelter-inplace locations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, and qualified contractor responder for post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The plan will be promptly updated to address any pertinent changes within the process that would require a modification of the emergency response plan. In addition, periodic emergency response drills are conducted to keep employees, contractors, and local responders familiar with the plan.\n\nVI. Five Year Update\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, the process hazard analysis of the ammonia storage and handling systems for all TVA facilities are reviewed in detail prior to the five-year anniversary of the original submission of the RMPs.

Personnel whose job tasks are\naffected by a modification in the process are promptly apprised of the modification and provided training to address the modification.\n\nPre-Startup Review: A pre-startup safety review was conducted prior to the startup of the new process. Established prestartup safety review procedures assured that construction and installation of covered process equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation and all elements of the RMP are in place.\n\nCompliance Audits: TVA conducts environmental and safety audits on a regular basis and will determine whether the\nprovisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. The audits will be conducted at least every 3 years and\nany corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be promptly and safely implemented.\n\nIncident Investigations:  Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.
