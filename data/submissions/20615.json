      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nFOR WTP #3\n\nRegulatory Overview\n\nThe Clean Air Act was Amended in 1990 and among its many changes, created Section 112(r), Prevention of Accidental Releases.  The Environmental Protection Agency instituted 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, as an implementing rule.  The purpose of the rule is to set forth requirements to prevent the accidental release of toxic substances and minimize the consequences of any release.  The rule is commonly referred to as the Risk Management Plan Rule.  The Environmental Protection Agency also finalized a list of 77 toxic and 63 flammable substances with specific threshold quantities.  Facilities that handle any of the listed substances above the threshold quantity are subject to the rquirements of the Risk Management Program Rule.\n\nChemical Substance\n\nOf the 140 chemical substances on the list, Water Treatment Plant #3 only uses or stores chlorine above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe Risk management Program requires the reporting of all accidental releases of covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage, in the last five years.  Water Treatment Plant #3 has had no accidental chlorine releases.\n\nOverall Safety\n\nThe facility implements safety and health policies and procedures that are communicated in the Water Utilities Department Safety and Health Manual.  These procedures are designed to protect workers from potential hazards when handling chemicals, operating a process, and maintaining equipment.  The Water Utilities Department has also prepared a Safety and Health Policy Statement.  A few extractions are as follows:\n\n\"It is the policy of Palm Beach County Water Utilities Department to ensure that every employee is entitled to a safe and healthful place to work and that activities are conducted in such a manner"

Included in the chlorine system design is a chlorine gas scrubbing system that absorbs and neutralizes any chlorine gas emitted \ninside the chlorine building.  The scrubbing system disallows chlorine gas to escape to the outdoor atmosphere.\n\nWater Treatment Plant #3 has been in compliance with OSHA 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals,\" for the chlorine system, since May, 1997.  The OSHA Standard has a prevention program similar to the Risk Management Program Rule.\n\nThe Risk Management Program Rule allows the facility to incorporate the requirements of the OSHA Standard and in effect, provide a facility plan that manages a formal prevention program and a emergency response program.  The facility meets compliance with both the Risk Management Plan Rule and OSHA's Process Safety Standard.\n\n\nProcess Description Overview\n\nChlorine gas is delivered to Water Treatment Plant #3 by truck in 1 ton steel containers (2,000 pounds of chlorine in each container).  A bridge crane and hoist are used to off-load the containers from the truck and place them inside the chlorine building in holders called trunnions.  This prevents containers from moving.  Empty containers are removed from the trunnions and placed on the truck to be returned to the supplier.\n\nThe chlorine gas process is operated such that only four containers are in use at any time and another four containers are on-line in reserve.  The containers being used and the reserve containers are placed on scales.  The scales are used to measure chlorine container contents and system usage.\n\nA Vacuum regulator is connected to each 1 ton "

      "SummaryText": "container and in turn is connected to piping that leads to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are connected to piping that leads to the injectors.  The chlorination process begins when process water flowing through the injector induces vacuum that is maintained throughout the entire chlorine feed system.  The chlorinator is set to allow a specific amount of chlorine gas to travel to the injector.  The vacuum allows the vacuum regulators on the chlorine containers to open and allow the chlorine gas to enter the piping system.  In any situation that decreases the vacuum in the pipelines, the vacuum regulators on the containers will close.  This safety feature prevents chlorine from escaping any part of the system.\n\nThere are chlorine gas detectors inside the chlorine building.  The detectors are set to alarm at 1 part per million and 3 parts per million and activate an audible and visual alarm.  At 3 parts per million, the chlorine gas scrubber unit that is interlocked with the detector will activate.  The scrubber system will maintain a negative pressure inside the chlorine building and draw the chlorine gas to where it will be neutralized.  No chlorine gas is expected to be emitted to the outside of the building.\n\nThe chlorine gas feed system has many built-in safety features that minimizes a chlorine gas release to the atmosphere.  They are:\n\nVacuum feed system instead of a pressurized system;\nVacuum regulator closes when vacuum is lost (i.e., broken pipe);\nVacuum regulator at each container;\nChlorine detector and alarm system;\nEnclosed chlorine gas system (building);\nChlorine gas scrubber system;\nOperational procedures;\nEmergency action plans.\n\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint.  The EPA has determined that the endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 milligrams of chlorine"

The endpoint value, determined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association, is a maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is an event that is unlikely to occur, but is considered to have the greatest impact on the facility and the community.  The facility's worst-case release scenario information may be found in Section 2 of this submittal.\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe EPA requires a selection of an alternate release scenario that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  In this scenario, the endpoint remains the same as 0.0087 milligrams of chlorine, per liter of air (about 3 parts per million).\n\nThe alternative release scenario is an event that may happen more often than the worst-case release scenario, but has a lesser impact on the community and facility.  The facility's alternative release scenario information may be found in Section 3 of this submittal.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nBoth the EPA Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Management Plan requires a accidental release prevention program.  The release prevention program in the Risk management Plan for Water Treatment Plant #3 complies with the requirements of both agencies.\n\nThe goal of the release prevention program is to reduce the risk to employees and the community of injury or death and the protection of the environment.  The prevention program requires in-depth review of the chlorine process and allows for the implementation of key elements or programs that prevent a release.  The following is an overview of the release prevention elements at Water Treatment Plant #3.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n"

This information includes the hazards of chlorine, the equipment used in the chlorine process such as vacuum regulators, type of piping for chlorine use, chlorinators, detector equipment, scrubber system components, etc.  This information is necessary to proceed with a process hazard analysis for the entire chlorine system.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA process hazard analysis is a method of identifying, evaluating, and controlling any risks associated with the chlorine process.  A Hazard and Operability Study was used to review the entire chlorine process.  Essentially it is a method where all parts of the system (i.e., from delivery of chlorine containers to endpoint of chlorine injected into the processed water) are looked at.  Any equipment or existing operational procedure that reveals a potential of a release is scrutinized and recommendations are made that will lessen or eliminate the risk of a release.  These recommendations are instituted where appropriate.\n\nIt should be noted that the Hazard and Operability Study is a multidisciplinary team approach that allows the participants to review risk in their area of expertise.  Some team members include a Process Hazard Analysis Team Leader, Plant Engineer, Plant Superintendent, Project Engineer, Facility Chief Operator, Industrial Electrician, and a Utility Plant Mechanic.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are in place for all stages of the chlorine system.  The facility uses a Job Safety Analysis format.  This format describes steps to be taken in a job task in proper sequence and intergrates critical safety precautions and personal protective equipment necessary to safely perform the task.  As examples, there are operating procedures for unloading new chlorine containers, system emergency shutdown, initial startup, chlorine scrubber test, chlorine detector test, etc.  Operators are trained and tested in these procedures"
