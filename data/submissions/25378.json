Chlorine is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers on an unenclosed, covered, concrete pad. The chlorine is stored as a pressurized liquefied gas, and is released into wastewater using a vacuum-regulated system. The maximum intended chlorine inventory at the facility is 10,000 pounds, which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 2,500 pounds.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used in the removal of chlorine from treated wastewater. Sulfur dioxide is stored prior to and during use in 1-ton containers in a totally enclosed process building with automatic vent closing devices and a chemical neutralization system. The sulfur dioxide is stored as a liquefied gas and released into wastewater using a pressurized system. The maximum intended sulfur dioxide inventory at the facility is 6,000 pounds which exceeds the RMP threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds.\n\nMethane is generated as a by-product of the digestion of organic materials during the wastewater treatment process.  The methane is collected for burning in the heat exchanger employed in the digestion process. Methane is present only in the piping between the digester and the heat exchanger. The maximum quantity of methane stored in piping at the facility is approximately 700 pounds, which does not exceed the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\nPropane is used to supplement methane as a fuels source for the heat exchanger employed in the digestion process. Propane is stored in a 500-gallon (water capacity) tank. The maximum intended inventory of propane stored at the facility is approximately 1,850 pounds, which does not exceed the RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n2.0 POLICIES\n\nBoth toxic and flammable chemicals are"

      "SummaryText": "used or generated at the facility.  Precautions must be taken in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to facility personnel and to reduce the threat of accidental release which might result in exposure to the surrounding community and to the environment. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and industry rules, regulations, and guidelines. Chemical safety at the City of Terrell WWTP is dependent upon strict operating procedures, safe handling methods, and thorough training of employees. Safety devices are also inherent in the design of the facility and in the equipment used in the chemical processes involving toxic and flammable chemicals.\n\n \n3.0 WORST CASE/ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIO ANALYSES INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO\n\nEPA defines the worst-case scenario as total failure of the largest vessel. The alternative-case scenario is defined as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst case scenario. The alternative-case scenario should also reach an offsite endpoint, unless no such scenario exists.\n\nChlorine\n\nAt the City of Terrell WWTP, the worst-case scenario for chlorine would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas. The impact radius would be 1.3 miles and affect 220 persons. Public receptors would include residences and major commercial or industrial areas. There are no environmental receptors within the impact radius.\n\nAs a result of a totally enclosed process building with automatic vent closing devices and a chemical neutralization system, no alternate release scenarios for a chlorine substitute sulfur dioxide release could be defined.  Therefore, there would be no off-site impacts under the alternate release scenario.\n\nSulfur Dioxide\n\nThe worst-case scenario for sulfur dioxide would result in a release of 2,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel and are revalidated at least once every five years. Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes, the City of Terrell is working to develop written operation procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nThe City of Terrell has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees who are operating the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes are competent in the operations procedures associated with the processes. \n\nMaintenance\n\nThe City of Terrell conducts regular maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n \nCompliance Audit\n\nThe City of Terrell conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nInci"
