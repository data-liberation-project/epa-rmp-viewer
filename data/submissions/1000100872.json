The Facility maintains the components of this system by conducting visual inspections on a routine basis and performing nondestructive testing of tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures are detected before they occur.  Highly skilled operators and mechanics, level controls, a leak detection alarm system, emergency procedures, preventative maintenance requirements, and restricted access procedures make a worst-case release highly unlikely. \r\n\r\nThe Facility has had no reportable accidents (incidents) related to RMP processes with off-site consequences in the last five years that resulted in injuries or property damage.  If there is an incident with HCl, a Facility incident command structure must be established to manage the situation and ensure the Emergency Response Plan is followed.  In addition, the Facility has engaged with local emergency response agencies regarding the hazards of on-site chemical storage and has officially notified the local Emergency Management Agency of Hamblen County, the Morristown Hamblen Healthcare System, Morristown Fire Department, and Morristown Police Department, in compliance with 40 CFR 262.17(a)(6), 262.256(a), and 26 Subpart M, to familiarize the agencies with the Facility layout, the properties of the hazardous materials on-site, locations where personnel are normally working, entrances to roads within the Facility, possible evacuation routes, and the types of injuries which could result from fires, explosions, or releases at the Facility."

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe Iatric Morristown Facility is committed to operating in a manner that provides for the safety of its employees and neighbors and for the protection of the environment.  A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals.  Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain and clean up the releases.\r\n\r\nThe Facility is located on 45 acres of land along Hamblen and Manchester Avenues, approximately 5 miles northeast of Morristown in Hamblen County, Tennessee.  Approximately 120 employees work to keep the Facility safely operating at peak efficiency up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year.  The Facility has proposed adding two storage tanks to hold a solution of HCl in water for later use as a component of a mixture for hand sanitizing wipes.  This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has a primary goal of operating in 100% compliance with existing environmental regulations, which includes accurate and timely reporting and striving for steady reduction of environmental impacts.  The Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public, and the environment.\r\n\r\nAs part of this commitment, the Facility has established a system that includes classroom and on-the-job training, written operating procedures, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and maintenance guidelines to help ensure the safe use of hazardous materials.  This system is summarized by the Emergency Response and Contingency Plan (ERCP) developed to meet federal and Tennessee Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 29 CFR 1910.38, Emergency Action Plans requirements.  The ERCP also serves as the Facility Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan, required by federal, state, and local agencies for response"
