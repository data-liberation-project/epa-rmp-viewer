The Tasks,\n\n1-4 indicate Environmental Engineering Consultants, Inc.'s\n\nevaluation of Linpac Plastics' compliance with the stated Rule.\n\n\n\n40 CFR Part 68.155(a):\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies;\n\n     Linpac's Process Safety Management (PSM) Policy requires\n\ndaily inspections by maintenance mechanics and the Plant\n\nEngineer.  Butane gas detectors are located in the Butane\n\nStorage Tank Area and in the Butane Pump Room.  These detectors\n\nare connected to a butane detection warning panel with lights and\n\na warning horn, it is also integrated into the fire alarm system. \n\nButane pumps and motors are regularly rotated with their backups\n\nto verify proper working order and to allow for scheduled\n\nmaintenance.  The Accidental Release Prevention Plan (ARP) is to\n\ncall 911 for emergency response, sound the evacuation alarm and\n\nevacuate the building.  If possible, the butane emergency\n\nshut-off will be activated and the power turned off to the butane\n\nmotors.  Operators will turn their equipment off as they\n\nevacuate.  Maintenance supervisors and lead operators will\n\nprovide first aid until paramedics arrive.\n\n     TASK 1 was to perform a Process Safety Management and\n\nAccidental Release Plan (PSM/ARM) Compliance Audit.  This\n\ncompliance audit indicated good overall compliance and\n\nexcellent results, with no accidents related to the Butane\n\nSystem. We recommend that all procedures be updated with the same\n\nformat as the \"Hazard Communication Plan\", and that a\n\n\"Date of Next Revision Due_____\" statement be added to clarify\n\nthe age of the procedure.\n\n\n\n40 CFR Part 68.155(b): \n\nStationary source and regulated substances handled;\n\n     Linpac Plastics, Inc. is a manufacturer of polystyrene\n\nplastic.  Linpac sells the polystyrene to clients and also uses\n\nit to manufacture various plastic containers, such"
