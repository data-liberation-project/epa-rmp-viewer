The safety and health of all personnel is the foremost concern in our company.  The control of accidents shall always be the responsibility of all employees here at this facility.\n\nIt is the Company's goal to control or eliminate all accidental losses of ammonia.  To accomplish this, the facility  has established a plant safety program.  The objectives of the safety program are to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\n\nThe Plant Safety Program includes associated acivities that have been developed and implemented to prevent accidental releases of ammonia and to provide an emergency response that is in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PMS) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM Program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR part 68).  The maintenance supervisor is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent any ammonia releases, and if there are any releases, to minimize the consequences of significant releases of ammonia, as well as fires, explosions and any other type of catastrophic accidents.  These programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illness and loss of property.\n\nB.\n\nAlthough U.S. Foodservice is a nation-wide concern, the U. S. Foodservice - Knoxville Division is a locally managed company with strong ties to the local community and the local emergency management organizations.\n\nWe are a fresh and frozen food warehouse as well as a food distributor for the Southeastern United States.  Our facility includes 50,000 square feet of freezer space and 10,000 square feet of cooler spac"

      "SummaryText": "e.To maintain these freezers and coolers we have an ammonia refrigeration plant with an inventory of 14,700 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia.  An ammonia release from this system could pose a risk of off-site public impact.  As this system's ammonia inventory exceeds the 10,000 pound threshold set by the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119) this is subject to the program's three requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program.\n\nIn our refrigeration system, low pressure ammonia vapor and cold ammonia liquid returns to a low pressure intercooler.  From the intercooler the liquid ammonia passes to receivers.  Compressors pull low pressure vapor from the receivers then compress the vapor to approximately 25 pounds (PSIG) per square inch guage pressure.  Second stage compressors again compress the ammonia vapor to 150 PSIG.  This high pressure ammonia vapor is supplied to condensers to remove excess heat and to liquidfy the ammonia.  The warm high pressure liquid ammonia flows to the high pressure receiver where a certain level is maintained.  The ammonia flows from the receiver to the intercooler where the temperature of the liquid is lowered.  The cold liquid ammonia is pumped to the freezers, chillers and evaporators thoughout our plant to pick up heat and repeat the cycle.\n\nC.\n\nThe worst case release scenario at our facility would involve the release of 14,000 pounds of ammonia over a thirty minuite period through a high pressure ammonia liquid line.  The worst case scenario would also assume the worst case weather conditions and under these conditions the ammonia would travel 1.08 miles before dispersing enough to be of no hazard to the public.\n\nThe worst case scenario at our plant is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n     1.  Industry standards for piping materials and the fabrication of these materials make failure unlikely.\n     2.  The new supervised operating system, on sensing a pressure drop, will isolate the leaking              \n          section of pipe.\n    "

Our facility has an emergency response program based on emergency response procedures which\n          enable trained personnel to quickly isolate any potential releases.\n\nThe alternative release scenario at our plant involves the release of 500 pounds of ammonia through a one-half inch (1/2\") liquid ammonia line for a ten minute period.  This one-half inch line is a drain line from the main receiver.\n\nThis alternative release scenario is unlikely at our facility for the following reasons:\n\n     1.  The high pressure liquid ammonia drain lines are located inside our engine room (an enclosed area\n          which will help contain a release of this type).\n     2.
