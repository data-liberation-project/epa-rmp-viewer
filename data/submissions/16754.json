We deal in agricultural commodities and agricultural inputs including anhydrous ammonia.  It is the intent of Regent Grain Co. to handle this substance in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.\n\nRegent Grain Co. spends a great deal of time, money, and resources each year to insure that our anhydrous ammonia handling equipment and prodedures are as safe as possible.  We are constantly on the lookout for ways to improve our transfer and storage process, and any improvements are implemented as soon as they become available.\n\nRegent Grain Co. has never had an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  In the unlikely event of an accidental release, we have planned for and have coordinated with local emergency responders to adequetely respond to all accidental releases that we forsee could happen at our facility from a simple hose break to release of the contents of our largest storage tank.\n\nRegent Grain Company wants to insure the public that the use of anhydrous ammonia is safe.  We have extensive employee training, inspection, and maintenance programs in place and we continuously update and change these programs as the need arises so that this substance is handled in the safest possible manner."
