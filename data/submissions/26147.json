Our farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan for prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The activity of this company is the retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as fertilizer for crop production.\n\nOur plant consists of two anhydrous ammonia storage tanks, one 18,000 gal. tank and one 30,000 gal. tank.  In addition, during the off season, there are 25 trailers that hold an additional 100,000 lbs.  The maximum quantity stored (filled at 85%) is 310,000 lbs.  The worse case release scenario would be a release of 131,000 pounds of NH3, over a ten minute period and has the potential to affect a total of nearly 20 people.  Distance to end point in worse case scenario would be 2.41 miles from our plant.  The alternative release would be a 11,908 lbs. Release (transfer hose failure) in approximately 2 minutes.  This release scenario would have a distance to endpoint of .83 of a mile, still affecting 4 residents. Our public receptors would include residences.\n\nOur plant is operated and maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations.  The employees who work in the facility are training at a state school every three years and company wide on a yearly basis on the proper procedures to operate the plant, as well as the procedures to full a nurse tank.  Our workers always have fresh safety water on hand and wear the proper personal protective equipment (goggles and gloves) during ammonia operations.\n\nGolden Valley, Inc. is proud to report that there have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years resulting in injury, property damage, death, evacuation, sheltering in place, or other emergency procedures.\n\nOur emergency response plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding p"
