Metropolitan provides approximately 60 percent of the drinking water used by nearly 19 million people living on the southern California coastal plain between Ventura County and the Mexican border.\n\n\n\nDisinfection is a critical process used by Metropolitan in the treatment of its drinking water.  Disinfection helps to protect public health by killing pathogens in the water and preventing the spread of waterborne diseases.  The use of chlorine as a disinfectant in the treatment of drinking water and wastewater has been the dominant disinfection method in the United States since it was introduced, around the beginning of the previous century.  Metropolitan currently utilizes bulk chlorine for disinfection at all of its water treatment plants, including the F. E. Weymouth Water Treatment Plant (Weymouth Plant).\n\n\n\nAs one might expect from its superior disinfection properties, chlorine is a hazardous substance.  Thus, storing and handling chlorine can present a risk to employees and the public without proper precautions.  Metropolitan regards safe practices in the storing and usage of chlorine to be of primary importance and has an excellent safety record with chlorine.  To further safe practices, Metropolitan has constructed a Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility at Weymouth Plant to contain all chlorine inside a building which is protected against accidental releases by chlorine vapor scrubbers.\n\n\n\nWeymouth Plant's chlorine storage and usage process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule (RMPR) and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulation.  Both of these regulations require submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely"

Chlorine leak detectors are provided in the storage bays, evaporator room, chlorinator room and pipe tunnels.  Based on the concentration and location of chlorine detected, the leak detection system will activate a succession of safety measures, beginning with visual and audible alarms, then start-up of the chlorine neutralization system and shut down of the normal ventilation system, and finally, automatically closing the online storage vessel liquid chlorine angle valve.  The alarms are annunciated locally and at the chlorine alarm panel as well as at the operator's console in the control room.  Once alerted, fully trained personnel will assess the chlorine leak.  In addition, each chlorine storage vessel liquid angle valve connected to the process is provided with a remotely actuated (pneumatic) emergency shutoff system.  In case of a major chlorine leak, chlorine supply can be stopped almost instantaneously by actuating the shutoff system, automatically or manually from any of the three control panels: unloading platform, chlorine maintenance room, or control room.

This information includes chlorine health and safety background information and SDS sheets.\n\n\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine process.  Specifications for chlorine process are collected and provided in one place for easy reference. Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.  Weymouth Plant also has procedures in place that are triggered to update process safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information outdated.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1992, 1995, and 1998 detailed process hazard analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the Chlorine System equipment and procedures.  As part of the January 2004 PHA, a PHA was conducted for the planned Chlorine Containment and Scrubber Modification project (i.e., Chlorine Containment and Handling Facility design and construction).

The operating procedures include connection/disconnection for chlorine storage vessel, start-up and shutdown for chlorine evaporators, after maintenance start-up for chlorine evaporators, maintenance shutdown for chlorine evaporators, start-up and shutdown for ejectors, start-up and shutdown for chlorinators, startup and shutdown for chlorine scrubber, chlorine system emergency shutdown, start-up following an emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.  Also included are the maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and the steps to correct or avoid deviations.  Weymouth Plant updates procedures at least annually, or whenever a change occurs that alters the steps needed to operate safely.  Updated operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or cha"

Weymouth Plant ensures that each employee newly assigned to the process, is trained and tested to be competent in the operating procedures pertaining to their duties.  Weymouth Plant training program includes four elements: (1) initial process and hazardous materials awareness training (2) refresher training, (3) documentation, and (4) testing.  Each employee presently involved in operating the chlorine process has been trained to safely carry out their duties and responsibilities as provided in the operating procedures.  \n\n\n\nRefresher training is provided at least every three years to each employee operating the covered process, to ensure that the employee understands and adheres to the current operating procedures.  In addition, Weymouth Plant ensures that operators are trained in any updated or new procedures prior to startup of a process after a change, as indicated in Management of Change and/or Pre Startup Safety Review documentation.\n\n\n\nWeymouth Plant prepares and retains records of initial and refresher training, which includes the identity of the employee, the date and location of training, the signature of the person administering the training and a copy of the test used to verify that the employee understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nWeymouth Plant has procedures and policies in place that ensure that contractors working in or near the chlorine process area are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to this process area, its Emergency Action Plan, and are prepared to safely complete their work.  Weymouth Plant holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the chlorine process area; controls access to this process area, and "

Weymouth Plant mechanical integrity program includes the following:\n\n-Written procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of process equipment. \n\n-Inspection and testing of process equipment, based on methods and frequency specified by equipment vendors, industry codes and practice, and/or prior operating experience.\n\n-Detailed documentation of such inspections and tests on the process equipment.\n\n-Training of personnel who will be maintaining the process in the mechanical integrity program procedures, an overview of the process and its hazards, and safe work practices applicable to their job tasks.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permits and Management of Change \n\nWeymouth Plant requires employees to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the covered process.  Weymouth Plant uses a permitting program to ensure hot work is monitored and conducted safely on or near the chlorine process.\n\n\n\nWeymouth Plant has developed and implemented procedures to manage changes (except \"replacements in kind\") that affect the chlorine process.  These procedures allow Weymouth Plant to identify and review any potential hazards and provide additional training, procedures and safety, process, or chemical information before the proposed change is installed and implemented.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.

This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, and a plan is developed to resolve the audit's recommendations and suggestions. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWeymouth Plant investigates all incidents that resulted in (or could reasonably have resulted in) a catastrophic chlorine release - a release that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment.  If required, an investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented and findings and recommendations are resolved.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed with all affected staff.  There have been no such incidents involving the Weymouth Plant chlorine system in the past five (5) years.\n\n\n\nThe Five-year Accident History Summary\n\nNo chlorine releases that caused or could have caused safety or health hazard (deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place) occurred at the Weymouth Plant during the last five years.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program Summary\n\nMetropolitan is currently a non-responding agency and, as such, does not have an emergency response plan.  Weymouth Plant has HAZWOPER-trained employees who will respond only to incidental chlorine releases.  Weymouth Plant also has employees trained to implement an Incident Command System.  If the accidental release requires an emergency response, external hazardous materials response agencies, such as the Los Angeles County Fire Department, will be called to handle a chlorine release.  Weymouth Plant coordinates with such local response agencies (Los Angeles County Fire Department and La Verne City Fire) to help ensure that they are familiar with the Weymouth Pla"
