This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances and our goal is to be Injury and Incident Free (IIF).  If a release does occur, refinery personnel are trained to respond to all types of events, including the control and containment of releases and the appropriate emergency response.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery, located in North Salt Lake City, Utah, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., refinery fuel gas, propane, butane, gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, petroleum coke, sulfur) from raw crude oil.  \n\n\n\nThe refinery has several regulated flammables on site.  Included in this are:\n\n\n\n- Hydrogen\n\n- Methane\n\n- Ethane\n\n- Ethylene\n\n- Propane\n\n- Propylene\n\n- Butane\n\n- Butene\n\n- Isobutane\n\n- Isobutene\n\n- 2-butene-cis\n\n- 2-butene-trans\n\n- 2-Methylpropene\n\n- 1,3 Butadiene\n\n- Pentane\n\n- Isopentane\n\n- 2,2-Dimethylpropane\n\n\n\nThe only regulated toxic substance that the refinery has above threshold quantities is hydrogen fluoride.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been 2 incidents subject to RMP 5-Year Accident History reporting in the past five years.    \n\n\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has an excellent record of accident prevention. The refinery has an integrated Loss Prevention System (LPS) where losses and near losses are reported and investigated.  By addressing all minor losses, the refinery reduces the probability of major incidents.  \n\n\n\nThe LPS process involves the refinery work force at all levels.  It places ownership of the process on line"

When events are investigated and root causes are identified, solutions are assigned to individuals and the responsible supervisors are required to verify that the solutions are complete and they are required to validate that the solution addresses the root cause (V&V).  \n\n\n\nFor this RMP report, where minor losses or near losses were identified in covered facilities, the latest such incident investigation was listed in section 7.11 (Prevention Program, Incident Investigation).  \n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Chevron Salt Lake Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and briefly describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery understands that engaging the entire work force is a key to the success of an effective prevention program and encourages all employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  To further empower workers and advocate a safe working environment, every employee and contractor is given a A Stop Work Authority CardA that allows each of them to stop any unsafe act without reprisal. This authority not only allows them to use stop work, but is an expectation of employment to stop all potentially unsafe tasks.  \n\n\n\nChevron Salt Lake Refinery has adopted ten A?Tenets of OperationsA?.  These tenets include operating within design limits, following procedures, ensuring safety devices are functioning, etc.  Copies of these tenets are posted around the refinery and management reinforces their importance and encourages workers to use their stop work authority if "

Employees have access to all information generated from the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters including specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis and configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, emergency response and exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for each unitA?s process parameters, including Safe Upper and Lower Limit and Consequence of Deviation tables.   Operating parameters are also documented in operating procedures, in the electronic control systems, and in equipment Safety Information Sheets (SIS).  The process parameters include temperature, level, composition and pressure.  The refinery ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, instrumentation monitoring, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems "

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provide a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience, as well as expertise in systems control technology and engineering.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\n\n\nPHA team findings are reviewed and findings are assigned to individuals and work groups for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident sc"

Refinery management is also involved in reviewing PHA corrective actions and providing the resources to assure their timely completion.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and this documentation is retained.\n\n\n\nChevron Salt Lake Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis.  These reviews include not only the original study data, but they include process changes in the last five years that have been made through the MOC process and they include a review of incidents both in the unit and in other similar units throughout industry.  Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  Operating procedures cover critical and infrequently performed tasks and provides a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are reviewed and certified annually.  The management of change (MOC) process includes steps to update and modify procedures to reflect changes made in the plants.  Additionally, the MOC process is used whenever changes are made to procedures which are independent of any physical plant change.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Chevron Salt Lake Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

After successfully completing this classroom and field training, and passing a number or written exams, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the plant operation, plant specific operating procedures, and they again review all changes made and any incidents that have occurred in the specific units.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including testing and coaching to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Chevron Salt Lake Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, ensuring the competency of the contractors and their employees is critical to the safe operations of the facility.  The refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  \n\n\n\nSalt Lake Refinery has a comprehensive Contractor Health, Safety & Environment Management (CHESM) process to assess and pre-qualify contractors before they can work in the refinery.
