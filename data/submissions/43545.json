Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nNational Fuel Gas recognizes management?s responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the Van facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company?s goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has a Plant Safety Program in place.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize efficiency and safety performance, reduce losses associated with damage of property, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA?s Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of flammable substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and acc"

Employee Participation:  This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program.  Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n!    Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes MSDSs and a description of the design of the Van Compressor Station.\n\n!    Process Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the HAZOP and What-If techniques have been conducted to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\n\n!    Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the Van Compressor Station.\n\n!    Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the Van Compressor Station.\n\n!    Contractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the Van Compressor Station.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n!    Pre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is completed for all new projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use.\n\n!    Mechanical Integrity:  This program ensures that the Van Compressor Station are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n!
