The mechanical integrity program includes the identification and categorization of equipment/instrumentation, inspection/tests and their frequencies, development of maintenance procedures and training of maintenance personnel, criteria for acceptable test results, documentation of test/inspection results, and documentation of manufacturer's recommendations to prevent failure of equipment and instrumentation. This program was review in October 2007 for both processess.\n\nHazardous work or nonroutine work is controlled in a consistent manner.  The hazards identified is communicated to those performing the work and to operating personnel whose work could affect the safety of the process.  The Linde Hazardous Work Program describes the steps that a supervisor, contractor representative or other authorized issuer needs to follow to manage hazardous work.   The program references and coordinates applicable lockout/tagout procedures, line breaking, hot work authorization, elevated work/fall protection, controlling access to covered process areas, and excavation procedures. Linde's Confined Space Entry Program is a separate permitting system designed to manage it's employees/contractors in performing this type of work. This Program was review in June 2005 for both employees and contractors.\n \nManagement of Change (MOC) procedures have been developed for permanent changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and facilities.  MOC procedures are designed to ensure that prior to any change occurring, that technically qualified personnel with knowledge and expertise of the chemical process, reviews and approves the proposed changes.  This would include both technical and mechanical changes.  Process changes include all modifications to equipment, procedures, raw materials and processing conditions other than replacement in kind.  A Process Change Authorization is required for all changes.  Management of Change procedures were rev"

      "SummaryText": "iew in October 2007.\n\nProcess incidents which result in or could reasonably have resulted in a release of Chlorine or Silane are investigated, including near misses, within 48 hours of the incident.  The purpose of the incident investigation is to identify the underlying causes of the incident and to implement corrective action to prevent similar incidents and avoid past mistakes.  Process incidents are investigated by a Team which include both management and employees and is multidisciplinary. An incident report is prepared following the investigation which includes the findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The Facility Manager is responsible for ensuring that all report recommendations are completed or resolved by those individuals responsible for follow-up. All resolutions are communicated to all affected employees.\n\nThe facility has an emergency preparedness/response plan.  The plan outlines what actions employees are to take when there is a release of Chlorine or Silane.  The plan complies with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38 and has been coordinated with local emergency response agencies.  The facilities Emergency Response plan was updated in December 2008 and tested every 12 months. \n\nThe facility receives a compliance audit in accordance with EPA's Risk Management Standard Part 68 at least once every three years.  The audit includes an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the risk management system and a field inspection of the safety and health conditions, and practices to ensure compliance.  The Team uses an audit tool to document each audit step and ensure an effective audit is conducted.  A Protocol Policy has been developed to ensure that proper follow-up is accomplished.\n\nLinde will make available all information, including any Trade Secret information as it relates to compliance with this regulation.   \n        \nThe facility has an Emergency Response Plan which has been integrated with the local community Emergency Response Plan.

The management and employees of the Medford facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of Chlorine or Silane.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the manufacturing, purification, and distribution of Electronic Gases. There are two covered PSM/RMP process. One of the processes is Chlorine storage, purification and filling. The other process is Silane storage and filling. \n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a flammable gas release (Silane) and the worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release (Chlorine), was used. The alternative release, or more probable, scenarios which was determined involved the release the flammable gas (silane) and one for the toxic gas release (Chlorine) were also base on EPA criteria.  Both can be reviewed by contacting the Linde facility.\n\nThe impacted area for both were determined using the 2000 US Census data obtained from Land View V.  No environmental receptors are affected.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of Chlorine and/or Silane.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continually improve the safety of the process.\n  \nWritten process safety information was developed"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for each process which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases. The PHAs focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA re-validation for the Chlorine Process was completed on June 29, 2005 and the PHA for the Silane Process was completed on September 16, 2005.

The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review in October 2007 for the Chlorine Process and Silane.

The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHA\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.  Each employee trained has a defined and documented program based on their job duties.  The training goals and objectives have been established and written in clear and measurable terms"

The training program was last reviewed in October 2007 for both processess.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractor safety procedures were last review in October 2007.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted in August 2003 for the Chlorine Process and Feb. 2006 for the Silane.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.
