The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2745, et. Seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\nHood prepared the RMP/PSM Program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve anhydrous ammonia handling systems and practices at the facility. In the unlikely event that a chemical release does occur at the facility, Hood has written an Emergency Response Program and personnel are trained in the appropriate response measures, relying on emergency services provided by the local fire department and the Sacramento County Hazardous Materials Response team. Hood will continue to improve ammonia-handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM Program.\n\nHood's Sacramento plant is located at 8340 Belvedere Avenue, Sacramento, California.

The refrigeration system, which is a closed system, contains approximately 29,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia. The system provides cooling to the cold storage rooms, and liquid product storage tanks. The cold rooms are used to store finished products ready for shipping. The liquid product storage tanks hold the raw milk before processing.\n\nThe RMP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP. Program 3 requirements of the RMP apply to the Crystal Belvedere facility due to the quantity of ammonia used. Program 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as ??the greatest amount held in a single vessel?released as a gas over 10 minutes.?  An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the facility.\n\nThis facility has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios.
