      "SummaryText": "The City of Alexandria (CoA) Water Department - Adam Station facility is located at 3410 Horseshoe Drive, Alexandria, Rapides Parish, Louisiana.   Chlorine for CoA's other chlorination sites is stored at this location.  The maximum amount of chlorine ever stored at this site is 34,200 pounds which is stored in both 1-ton and 150-lb gas cylinders.\n\nThe facility is included in the written community emergency response plan. In the event of a chlorine leak, CoA has an emergency response policy which requires all personnel to notify Louisiana State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 center in addition to local fire and police departments.  These emergency response agencies are used to assist in evacuating citizens in the affected area.  CoA has no history of reportable releases of chlorine at this site and no injuries or property loss have been associated with this chemical. \n\nCurrently, CoA uses daily inspections and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  There are no active or passive mitigation techniques currently being used at the facility.  CoA is reviewing possible active and passive mitigation in order to improve safety at the facility.  On-going operator training and preventative maintenance continue to be key tools to ensure the safety of the public.  Plant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine stored in cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.  "
