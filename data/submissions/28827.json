The Facility Policy\n\n\tMFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Bulk Fertilizer Plant in Wentzville are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Wentzville Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry fertilizer, chemicals, and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as pest control and crop nutrients.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 84,118 pounds in our 18,000-gallon storage tank. Product will be received by tanker trucks, which typically hold 50,000 pounds.  The facility also has a 12,000 gallon storage tank that when filled will hold approximately 56,078 pounds.  There are twenty-seven 1,000 gallon nurse tanks that when filled would hold approximately 117,045 pounds.  Also, there are eight 560 gallon \napplicator tanks that when filled would hold 19,421 pounds.  \nTherefore, the facility has a total storage capacity of approximately 276,662 pounds.  \n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 84,118 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.9 miles.\n\n\n\tb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a 3 transfer hose during receiving operations."

The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1981, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere was an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia that \noccurred at this facility on 6/26/2000. The release was\ncaused by a valve left open after an attempted theft of \nanhydrous ammonia.  The release lasted an estimated 4 hours and 44 minutes with approximately 1,700 pounds of product lost. The Wentzville Fire Department was called and assisted with controlling the release. No evacuations were required and no\nenvironmental damage occurred.  \n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n\tb. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n\t   planning and community right-to-know information as\n\t   required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n\tc. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n\t   OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n\t   planning and employee training.\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\tSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\n\t6/17/03"
