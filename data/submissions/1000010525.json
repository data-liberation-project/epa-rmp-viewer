      "SummaryText": "SUN PACIFIC TULARE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe refrigeration system at Sun PacificA?s Tulare facility provides process cooling for the facilityA?s two precooler rooms, three cold storage rooms, the hydrocooler, ten controlled atmosphere rooms, and associated hallways and dock areas.  Since the cold storage refrigeration system handles more than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, the Tulare facility has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration system.  \n\nSun Pacific also operates a chlorination system to generate chlorinated process water for the packing plant.  The chlorination system utilizes one ton containers for the chlorine source.  Since the chlorination process handles more than the 2,500 pound threshold quantity, Sun Pacific has also developed a PSM program for the chlorination process.    \n\nThe chlorination system incorporates many inherently safe design features.  These features include fail safe (vacuum open and spring close) flow valves in the vacuum feed regulator and ejectors that fail in the closed position.  As such, the equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\nAs part of the PSM programs, Sun Pacific completed process hazard analyses, developed written operating procedures, trained employees on the refrigeration system, and developed a mechanical integrity program for the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  In addition to plant personnel monitoring the operation of the refrigeration system on a daily basis, Sun Pacific has implemented a preventative maintenance program to ensure that the refrigeration equipment is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\nAdditionally, Sun Pacific emphasizes safe and environmentally sound operating practices and procedures through their employee training programs.

As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Tulare facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nSun Pacific has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and RMP regulations.  At least every three years, Sun Pacific audits these programs and any findings of noncompliance are documented and responded to and the deficiencies are corrected.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n Sun Pacific owns and operates the Tulare facility located at 13129 Road 248 (approximately 3.6 miles east of Highway 99).  The closest population center to the packing house/cold storage facility is Tulare, which is approximately 3 miles southwest of the facility. \n\nThe ammonia based refrigeration system consists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, six compressors, two evaporative condensers, a high pressure receiver, a hydrocooler, two precool rooms, three cold storage rooms, ten controlled atmosphere rooms, and fifteen direct expansion evaporators for cooling the hallways and dock areas.       \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration system.  However, during major maintenance activities, the entire refrigeration system can be A?pumped downA? to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 26,519 pounds. \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the to"

In the chlorination process, fresh water is pumped through an ejector that creates a vacuum which draws chlorine gas from a vacuum feed regulator installed on a one ton container. A rotameter is installed in the vacuum tubing upstream of the ejector to regulate the flow of chlorine gas into the ejector where the chlorine gas mixes with the water.  This arrangement chlorinates the process water only when the fresh water pump is on and there is water flow through the ejector.  The maximum quantity in a one ton container is 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  \n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for chlorine is defined as 0.0087 mg/l (3 ppm).  This concentration of chlorine has been established by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA PSM program, which meets the requirements of the general accidental release prevention program, has been developed by Sun Pacific to address the anhydrous ammonia system.
