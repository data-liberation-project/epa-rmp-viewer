Accidental release prevention and enmergency policies:\n\nWe at the City of Rock Island are committed to a safe working environment for employees, community, and the environment. Procedures and equipment have been reviewed to ensure that the chlorine system  is as safe as possible. If for some reason there was a chlorine gas laek, we are coordinated with the Rock Island Fire Dept for response.\n\n\n\n2.The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handles:\n\nWe have 1 regulated chemical, which is chlorine. The maximun inventory is 3 cylinders, which is 6000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.The Worst Case Scenario and Alternative Relaese Scenario:\n\nTo perform the OCA we used look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA.\n\n\n\nToxic Worst Case: The worst case scenario involves the catastrophic release of chlorine gas from a ruptured tank. This release would be 200 lbs/min for a total of 2000 lbs. The distance to end point is 1.3 miles and the affected population is 9,144.\n\n\n\nToxic Alternative analysis: the Alternative scenarion involves a release of chlorine gas from a broken valve or pipe at the rate of 0.33 lbs/min for a total of 200 lbs. The distance to end point is 0.08 miles and the affected population is -0-.\n\nFlammable Worst Case analysis: none applicable\n\nFlammable Alternative analysis: none applicable\n\n\n\n4.General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prvention requirements of 40 CFR part 68.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nThe City of Rock Island wastewater plant maintains records of safety information, chemical hazards, operating procedures, and equipemnt design info.\n\n\n\nProces Hazard Analysis:\n\nOur facility conducts a PHA with a team of employees using the \"what-if\" methodology at 5 year intervals. Any findings are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Plant maintains specific operating procedures for the chlorination process. The information is "
