As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC. completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting thresholds of 10,000 pounds for pentane and 20,000 pounds for aqueous ammonia.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC. is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically pentane, as a constituent of the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant and aqueous ammonia.  The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Pacific Ethanol Magic Valley, LLC. to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.
