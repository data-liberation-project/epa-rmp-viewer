We feed out of one manifold at a time, keeping gas pressure off of the manifold not in service. Each manifold has 2 isolation valves which are attached to the cylinders with nickle cadmium flexible line. These lines are changed when damaged or every 3 months. We check this location several times a day. We have 2 leak detectors, one located in the chlorine cylinder room, one other in the chlorinator feed room. Both are checked monthly with a chlorine solution. Two people are required when changing chlorine at this plant and each individual is required to carry an excape pack. We have 2 SCBA's on site and an emergency \"B\" kit. All this equipment is enclosed in concrete building equipped with exhaust fans with outside switches.",

The plant is a municipal facility, owned and operated by the City of Texarkana, Texas, located in the City of Texarkana, Bowie County, Texas with an approximate capacity of (18) million gallons per day. The facility's only activity is to treat surface water to drinking water standards for customers in the Texarkana area.\n\nLiquid chlorine is the only chemical used in sufficient quantity at the facility to be regulated under the RMP program. Up to fourteen (14) one ton cylinders are stored on site at any one time with no more than two cylinders, piped independently, used in the process.\n\nTexarkana Water Utilities is dedicated to the safe and proper handling of chemicals necessary for the production of drinking water and treatment of wastewater for its citizens. Utility management has consistently budgeted and the elected bodies of the two Texarkana's have consistently approved funds to support personnel and citizen safety preventative maintenance training, chemical awareness and handling, emergency response and equipment related to chemicals at the facility.\n\nSeveral training and procedural methods make a worst case release unlikely. The site is staffed twenty-four (24) hours a day with periodic inspections of the chlorination facilities made on each of the three daily shifts. Highly trained personnel and an extensive preventative maintenance program keep all chlorination equipment in like new condition. The chlorination room is monitored by a remote chlorine gas detector and alarm set a 1 ppm. Safety procedures, including those associated with chlorine are standardized through written Standar Operating Procedures (SOP's). Chlorine cylinder repair kits are kept at several locations in the system.\n\nFor the same reasons listed for the worst case scenario, an alternate accidental release is hig"

The facility makes use of written, video and classroom training from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Arkansas Department of Health, Chlorine Institute, The American Water Works Association and the Water Environment Association. Facility management has developed written standard operational procedures for all chemical equipment and chemical handling. These SOP's set up and require extensive preventative maintenance programs that provide frequent checks and keep equipment in like new condition. Gas detection and alarm devices are used to provide early alert to any chlorine releases.\n\nThere have been no reportable chlorine releases or accidents for a period exceeding five (5) years largely due to the previously described steps taken by Texarkana Water Utilities Management.\n\nThe Utility is included in the written community emergency response plan and maintains a close working relationship with the local Emergency Management Office. The facility has its own written emergency response plan and particiapes in site-specific, multi-agency response drills. Highway 59 Environmental, a company which maintains a Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) team, is available to back up and respond to any chemical release.\n\nThe Utility has a geographic information system base map to assist utility, fire, police and emergency management personnel in prevention and response planning for any chemical release."
