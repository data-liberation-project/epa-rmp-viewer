Facility Policy.\n       \n      The owners, management, and employees of Monke Bros. Fertilizer, Bennington Location, are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, the Douglas County LEPC, and any other necessary authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n \n2.   Facility information.\n      \n      The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers as a fertilizer. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.\n\n        The maximum quantity stored would be 310,000 pounds in a number of tanks.  These would include our storage tanks and nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled would be the loss of ammonia from the largest storage tank holding approximately 69,000 pounds, and we will use this quantity as our worst case scenario.\n\n3.   Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario.\n\na.   The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 69,000 pounds, which represents the volume of  the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 3.1 miles.\n\nb.   The alternative release scenario, based on the most likely potential incident, would be the rupture of a 2-inch transfer hose.  Ammonia is released for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve intervenes or a remote manual shut-off valve is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. "

(ANSI) and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CRF 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. The OSHA standard is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see section 8.3 (b).\n5.   The Five-Year Accident History.\n\na.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that \n       have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at this facility; nor to \n       our knowledge has there been any accidental releases resulting in any off-site deaths or\n       injuries.\n\nb.  There was an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia of approximately 30,000 pounds\non June 3rd, 2002, occurring at 8:34 am. This release was caused by a mechanical error, in the 2\" transfer hose, which occurred during the transfer of ammonia from the tractor transport to the storage tank. There were no injuries resulting from this release, but there was off-site property damage. The areas damaged were; some nearby crops, a stream to the west, and a soccer complex to the east. The release also forced an evacuation of  approximately 50 persons for a small period of time, as well as closing a portion of a county road.\n\n\n6.   Emergency Action Plan.\n       \n      The facility has:\n\na.   A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.   Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.   Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\n       Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic revi"
