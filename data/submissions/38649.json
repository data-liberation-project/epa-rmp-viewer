As a member of the NACD, CCI adheres to and supports the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP) and all of its tenets, to include documented policies, practices and procedures for the safe and responsible handling of chemicals, compliance with all pertinent regulatory agencies, response to chemical releases and promotion of public awareness and community, vendor and customer relations.                                                                                                                      Accidental release of chemicals is mitigated by employee training, strict inventory practices, established standard operating procedures, maintenance practices and engineered systems to control and contain all processes. Emergency response activities are governed by written policies, practices and procedures as documented in our Comprehensive Emergency Response Manual. These activities are re-enforced by no less than annual training, mock drills, cooperation and training with local fire department and certified HAZWOPER trained employees. In accordance with Federal and State regulations, we adhere to the requirements of SARA Title III and file appropriate documents with the State Emergency Response Board and the Local Planning Committee.

The general accidental release and chemical specific prevention steps are specified in CCI Operations, Compliance Safety and Training and Comprehensive Emergency Response Manuals. CCI provides engineered and contained areas for packaging of these materials. Further, depending upon the CCI assigned chemical class for a given chemical, operators willl have been trained extensively for the safe and proper handling of these chemicals as well as responses to incidents.

Three additional employees are trained at the Specialist level-plus (with capabilities as On-Site Commanders) and are assigned as the company Primary and Secondary Emergency Coordinators. Protocols in accordance with the CCI Comprehensive Emergency Response Plan delineate the chain of command and responsibilities of all CCI employees to include reporting incidents up through the contacting of local emergency response organizations and duties related to coordinating with those organizations.
