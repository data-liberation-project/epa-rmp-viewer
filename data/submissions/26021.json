ROCHESTER RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAt Arch Chemicals-- Rochester, we are committed to operating and maintaining all our processes, especially those using hazardous substances, in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as the environment. This summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented such as:\n     * A brief description of our facility and use of substances regulated by the EPA risk management regulation\n     * A summary of results of the worst case and alternative release scenarios required by the rule\n     * An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n     * The five year accident history for the facility\n     * An overview of the plant emergency response program\n     * An overview of planned improvements at the facility to minimize the number and severity of release incidents\n     * Certification of the executive summary and risk management plan\n\n\nDESCIPTION OF FACILITY\n\nThe Arch Rochester facility produces biocide, wood treatment, and specialty chemical products. The biocide products made at the plant are used as ingredients in dandruff shampoos, anti-foulant paints, and coatings. The specialty chemicals produced are used in pharmaceuticals, paints, coatings and many other products. The Rochester facility has been in operation since 1950 and currently employs approximately 115 employees. The plant operates 24 hours per day seven days per week and 365 days per year.\n\nThe regulated chemicals handled at the Rochester plant subject to the EPA risk management rules are chlorine and hydrazine which are both listed as toxic chemicals. The maximum inventory onsite of chlorine is 360,000 pounds and the maximum inventory of hydrazine is 40,000 pounds. The Arch Rochester plant does not han"

      "SummaryText": "dle any of the EPA listed flammable chemicals.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe EPA risk management rule requires that each facility subject to the rule provide a worst case release scenario for toxic and flammable chemicals and an alternate release scenario for each toxic chemical. The Arch Rochester plant does not handle listed flammable chemicals. Following are the toxic chemicals worst case and alternative release scenarios.\n     WORST CASE\nThe Arch Rochester worst case release assumes a catastropic rupture of a chlorine railcar within the plant property. Per the requirements of the EPA rule it is assumed that the entire contents of the railcar, 180,000 pounds, are released to the air in a 10 minute period. As required by the rule, the wind speed is assumed to be 1.5 m/sec, the temperature 25 degrees centigrade, and the relative humidity 50%.\n\nWith the assumed conditions, the chlorine could travel up to 25 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public. Within the 25 mile area, there would be potential exposure to schools, homes, businesses, shopping malls, nursing homes, parks, and recreation areas.To ensure that this type of release never occurs, the following safety measures have been taken:\n     + Substantial construction of chlorine railcars per ASTM codes\n     + Regular preventive maintainance of chlorine railcars and ancillary equipment\n     + Excess flow valves installed on each car to minimize a release\n     + Chlorine monitors in chlorine handling areas to warn of a release\n\n     ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     1) CHLORINE\nThe alternate case release of chlorine assumes a leak and subsequent vaporization of chlorine from the 2-dichloropyridine (2PCl) process. The entire contents of the chlorine process piping system would be released due to failure of a flange gasket. This would result in the release of approximately 667 pounds of chlorine. It is assumed that the leaking flange is 200 feet fr"

      "SummaryText": "om the nearest chlorine monitor. It would take approximately 5 minutes for the monitor to alarm and alert the area operator. It would then take approximately 3 minutes for the operator to shut off the emergency shut off valve on the railcar. The emergency alarm would then be sounded and the emergency response team would be activated. If all of the pipeline contents are released it is estimated that the chlorine could travel 0.98 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public. Local businesses and neighbors would be notified to shelter in place until the release was dispersed.\n\nTo minimize the possibility of such a release and to minimize the possible exposure of the public Arch has implemented the following:\n     +Written operating procedures and highly trained operators\n     +Routine preventive maintainance and equipment inspections\n     + Installation of chlorine monitors in area \n     +Routine safety and emergency response drills\n     +Closely working with Monroe County LEPC to plan emergency response plan\n     +Prompt notification of neighbors \n\n     2) HYDRAZINE\n\nThe alternative release scenario for hydrazine assumes that a valve leaks on the bottom of a 275 gallon Tote tank emptying the entire contents of the Tote into a concrete diked area. It is assumed that the spill is contained within the diked area. Per the EPA look-up tables it is estimated that the vapors would travel 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to not pose a significant hazard to the public.\n\nArch will implement similar measures as noted in the chlorine alternate release to minimize the possibility of a release and the offsite impacts.\n\n\nARCH ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAMS\n\nArch takes a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. The management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n     *Process safety information\n     *Process hazard analysis\n     *Written operating p"

Introduction of a new chemical manufacturing process requires qualification/ certification of both the physical plant and human factors/elements. High standards are maintained throughout each stage to insure compliance with all applicable safety and environmental regulations. This certification process is called \" Safety in Engineering,  Technology, Construction, and Operations\" or SETCO process. \n\nAll of these elements work together to prevent chemical releases. Arch is committed to provide a safe work place for its employees and a safe environment for our neighbors. In fact, Arch has in place an initiative called ,\" Goal is Zero.\" This means that each Arch facility is committed to a goal of having zero injuries, zero release of chemicals, and zero impact on its neighbors.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nArch has had one release of EPA RMP listed chemicals in the last five years. This occurred on January 20,1998. A one pound release of chlorine resulted from a transfer line leak. One employee received a minor inhalation injury. There were no off site impacts.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE  PROGRAM\n\nArch maintains a comprehensive emergency response plan that is coordinated with the Monroe County emergency response plan. The Arch plan provides essential planning and training for effectively protecting our workers, the public, and the environment on an ongoing basis and during emergencies. Arch jointly conducts training and emergency drills with the local fire department and other emegency agencies.\n\nPLANNED SAFETY"
