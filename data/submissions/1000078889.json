The facility is a manufacturer of fresh, smoked and processed pork products for the retail and food service industries.  Operations include packing, cooking and processing meats. Rose Packing produces Canadian Style Bacon and a full line of raw and fully cooked pork sausage, ethnic sausage and back ribs.  The facility also makes hams, smoked pork shoulder butts, sectioned and formed processed pork, fresh boneless backs, pork roasts and pork tenderloins.  The NAICS code for the facility is 311612.\r\n\r\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one recirculating closed-loop refrigeration system onsite. The system contains a charge of 49,000 pounds of ammonia, which is above the minimum threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nAn aerial map has been provided in Appendix B. \r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.
