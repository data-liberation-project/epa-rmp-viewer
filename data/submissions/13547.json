Employees receive training in safety and operations as we strive to minimize the potential release of product due to human error.  The facility is located on the east side of the city and contains anhydrous ammonia storage tank, a propane storage tank, grain and fertilizer storage areas as well as the branch office.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, transferred and stored, and redistributed as a crop nutrient to our farmer owners.  Our maximum quantity stored at any time is 120,000 pounds, 14,380 gallons.  The worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint concentration of 200ppm at 1.10 miles from the storage tank.  As an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, the amount of ammonia released before mitigation would reach a toxic endpoint of 200 ppm at .40 mile from the storage tank.  White River Cooperative has instituted procedures fro Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as required by OSHA and the Indiana  State Chemist.  We have not had a release resulting from any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.42 within the last five years.  Our Emergency Response Plan is in place and has been reviewed with current employees and they have been trained in the procedures.  All new hires will receive training prior to any exposure to ammonia.  Local emergency responders have received training in the hazards associated with responding to any anhydrous ammonia incident.  White River Cooperative has policies in regards to equipment maintenance and the handling and transportation of hazardous materials, including anhydrous ammonia.  We will utilize periodic inspections to maintain compliance and improve safety for all employees and the surrounding community and environment.  We will do product pre-transfer inspections of equipment and ap"
