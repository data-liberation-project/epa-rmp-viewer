It is also our policy to conduct scheduled trainings for all of our employees that handle any regulated substance. Our prevention program also includes coordination with the City of Florence Fire Department and the Florence Lauderdale Emergency Management Agency (EMA) which provides emergency personnel and equipment to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n2   The Facility and The Regulated Substance Handled\n\n     The Cypress Creek Water Treatment Plant\u00c2\u00bfs primary activity is to provide potable water to the City of Florence and Lauderdale County while meeting or exceeding all Federal and State regulations. The one regulated substance at this facility is chlorine.  This chlorine is used for disinfecting treated water for potable use by the City of Florence and Lauderdale County. The maximum inventory at this facility is 12,000 pounds.\n\n3    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps\n\n      This facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n      The Cypress Creek Water Treatment Plant maintains safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and procedures, and equipment designs associated with the chlorinating process.\n\nPro"
