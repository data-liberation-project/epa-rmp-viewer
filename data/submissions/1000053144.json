Equistar provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, conducts regular drills to review response activities and coordinates response efforts with area industry and the local emergency response agencies.  Equistar trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, Equistar works with the area industry, the local fire department and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.

The following facilities (processes) are covered by this Rule:  Olefins unit, Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) unit, Linear Low Density (LLDPE) unit.  The Morris Plants key products are ethylene, propylene, low-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene with by-products of hydrogen, crude butadiene and aromatic gasoline.

The Morris Plant performed off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for accidental release of a regulated substance that may affect the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a worst-case release scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for each toxic and one to represent all flammables.  In reality, Equistar does not expect a worst-case scenario to ever occur.  The alternative release scenarios were developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nEPA Look-Up Tables were used for evaluating the worst and alternate case release scenarios for flammable and toxic materials.  The EPA recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within this distance from the location of the covered processes.

The mechanical integrity program includes:\r\n- Specifications for inspection and testing of process equipment\r\n- Specifications for replacement parts and equipment\r\n- Procedures for inspecting, testing, and maintaining process equipment\r\n- Procedures for safe work practices such as Lock-Out/Tag-Out; Hot Work; Confined Space Entry; and Line Breaking\r\n- Training of maintenance personnel\r\n- Documentation of maintenance activities\r\n\r\n4.6     \tManagement of Change\r\n\r\nThe Morris Plant management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment and procedures for a covered process to ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations.  Process changes that are determined to be replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change review.  All other changes must be confirmed through the full management of change review to ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n4.7     \tPre-startup Review\r\n\r\nThe Morris Plant performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to ensure that the process has been prepared to operate safely.  This review confirms that:\r\n- Construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications\r\n- Adequate safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place\r\n- Employee training has been completed\r\n- For a covered process, that management of change requirements has been completed\r\n- A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed\r\n\r\n4.8     \tCompliance Audit\r\n\r\nThe Morris Plant audits the covered process to be cer"

      "SummaryText": "safely performed.  The operating procedures (1) are used to train employees and (2) serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.  Operating procedures include:\r\n- Steps for safely conducting activities\r\n- Applicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations\r\n- Safety and health considerations such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements and actions to take if exposure to a hazardous substance occurs\r\n- Plant personnel develop and maintain operating procedures that cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown, and temporary operations.\r\n\r\n4.4     \tTraining\r\n\r\nThe Morris Plant trains its workers to safely and effectively perform their assigned tasks.  The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and (3) a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the employee can work in the process.  The operators are consulted annually at safety meetings to evaluate the effectiveness and frequency of the training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\r\n\r\n4.5     \tMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Morris Plant maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public or the environment.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1) an inspection and testing program to identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails and (2) a quality assurance program to ensure that new and replacement e"
