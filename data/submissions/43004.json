Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management, and employees of Roth Farms Inc., Harrisonville, MO ( the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releaase of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mittigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\n     a. The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 85,000 lbs, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.8 miles.\n\n     B. The alternate release scenario, is based on the five-year accident history( or the most likely potential incident), is the release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint ( point of dispersion) is 1.6 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n     The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, k-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occuptational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". The OSHA Standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b\n\n5. Five- Year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past"

Emergency Response Program\n\n    The facility has:\n\n       a. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38\n\n       b. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPRCA);\n\n       c. A written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
