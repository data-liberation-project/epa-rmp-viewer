      "SummaryText": "A.  H.P. Hood (Hood) is committed to operating its Winchester, VA plant in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and surrounding community.  Hood has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  Hood has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant in conjunction and with the Stephens City Fire Department.\n\nB.  The Hood facility in Winchester, VA is a milk and dairy processing plant that uses anhydrous ammonia to refrigerate the plant for dairy processing.  Ammonia is the RMP covered substance at the plant.\n\nC.  The Hood facility in Winchester, VA is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the ammonia refrigeration process.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD.  There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE.  The Hood has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the Stephens City Fire Department for more extensive releases. \n\nF.  Hood has a very strong safety program both at the plant and throughout the organization.  At this time, Hood has no additional changes planned to improve safety at the plant."
