      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary Risk Management Program Plan\nCity of Vancouver Brookside Chlorine Storage Facility\n\nThis Risk Management Program (RMP) submittal is for the City of Vancouver (Vancouver) Department of Public Works (Public Works) Brookside chlorine storage facility (Brookside), located at 2323 General Anderson Road, Vancouver, Clark County, Washington.  Chlorine gas, used for drinking water disinfection, is stored at Brookside in 150 pound cylinders.  Vancouver receives, stores, and distributes chlorine gas cylinders to groundwater pump stations at the Brookside chlorine storage area.  Brookside qualifies for a Level 2 RMP since there are potential offsite receptors within the area of a worst case release.  Facility emergency response is provided by the City of Vancouver Fire Department.  More information on these safety aspects is given below.\n\n                     Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Action/Response Policies\n\nIt is the policy of Vancouver to handle and use chlorine and other chemicals in the safest means practicable.  Vancouver has a comprehensive safety program that includes a proactive prevention program, comprehensive training for workers, state of the art release containment and treatment systems, and has coordinated emergency response with the Fire Department in the unlikely event of a chlorine release.  In light of these safety considerations, the benefits of drinking water disinfection (a safe secure supply of clean drinking water) greatly outweigh the minor risk of chlorine storage at Brookside.\n\n                                       Brookside Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nAt Brookside full and empty 150 pound chlorine cylinders are stored in the chlorine storage area containment room, with a maximum of  twenty 150 pound full chlorine cylinders.  The room is served by an emergency air scrubber system, which when activated by automatic chlorine sensors, has the capacity to neutralize up to 150 pounds of chlorine.  The e"

In this event, an estimated 8.3 pounds of chlorine would escape from the building each minute over a period of about 10 minutes.  According to air dispersion modeling for such a release, the chlorine, which is heavier than air, would disperse to a safe concentration (about 3 parts per million) after traveling up to 0.3 miles.  The radius of this potential area encompasses a residential population estimated at 1,300 persons.  Potential public receptors within this area include schools, residences, and major commercial, office, or industrial areas.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a full 150 pound tank leak event where the emergency scrubber system functions normally.  In this case, chlroine will be treated before it is released from the storage building at harmful concentrations.  The release is contained, so there are no offsite impacts. \n\n                                         Accidental Release Prevention Program\nProgram elements to minimize accidental releases include facility hazard reviews, Fire Department inspections, ongoing operator training, and scheduled equipment maintenance.\n\n                                                    Five-Year Accident History\nNo releases of chlorine or other chemicals that resulted in injury, evacuation, or sheltering in place to offsite receptors within the last five-years at Brookside.\n\n                                                 Emergency Response Program\nVancouver is included in the community emergency response plan that includes elements covering release notification, emergency c"

Public Works employees do not respond to emergency releases, rather they are trained to notify the Fire Department, who provide emergency response services to Brookside.  Public Works water system operators are not on site full time, but work at the different groundwater pump stations.\n  \nBrookside has remote release sensors that are monitored by a 24-hour alarm service.  The alerm service will notify the fire department and page the key Public Works staff, who respond to the situation.  Emergency personal protection equipment is not maintain on-site as workers do not respond to emergency situations.

Training exercises will continue on a regular basis.  No major safety modifications to Brookside are currently planned."
