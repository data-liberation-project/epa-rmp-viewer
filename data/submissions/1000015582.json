ONWASA senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also to maintain a comprehensive safety and environmental program for all its employees and the surrounding communities. ONWASAA?s Safety and Risk manager as well as the Plant Superintendent and Plant Supervisor are responsible for administering the facility's safety and environmental policies and programs. These policies/programs include (but are not limited to) job hazard analyses, hazard communication, lockout/tagout, employee safety manuals, manufacturers documentation, operating procedures, emergency response procedures, and Process Safety Management (PSM) included incorporated into the Risk Management Plan. Various inspections and audits of the facility are conducted to ensure compliance as well as provide oversights of the policies in place.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nChlorine is stored as a liquefied gas under pressure using two one-ton storage tanks that are located indoors. Administrative controls are in place such that each storage tank is filled to no more than 80% of capacity. Therefore, each storage tank is filled to 1600 lbs. The chlorine is withdrawn from one tank either as a pressurized gas and directed to the chlorinators. Before reaching the chlorinators, the pressurized chlorine gas is reduced to vacuum conditions using vacuum regulators. Chlorinators are then used to control the chlorine feed rate required to disinfect the water supply. The metered chlorine from each chlorinator is directed to a dedicated injector which dissolves the chlorine gas into a stream of water to form a chlorine solution. The chlorine solutio"

The maximum intended inventory of chlorine at the Dixon Water Treatment Plant is 2 tons (4,000 pounds). \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe chlorine system at the Dixon Water Treatment Plant was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Building Code, and the Uniform Fire Code. All of these codes serve to reduce the risk within the facility by specifying acceptable design criteria for the chlorine system and on-site buildings. In addition, the facility was designed in accordance with industry standards and with generally accepted engineering practices. The Dixon Water Treatment Plant has established and implemented a mechanical integrity program for maintaining and operating the chlorine equipment. The facility is in compliance with all federal, state and local regulations concerning the storage and handling of chlorine at this level.\nThe chlorine system is designed to operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to provide a safe water supply for distribution. To ensure safe operations, the chlorine system is located within a dedicated Chlorine room that is equipped with chlorine sensors that can detect leaks. The chlorine sensors trigger alarms at .5 ppm. In the event that the alarm is triggered, an audible horn sounds and a red light flashes (both located outside the room). In addition, an audible alarm on the SCADA system activates alerting the plant operators and SCADA operators at the operations center that there is a chlorine leak in the Dixon Water Treatment Plant chlorine cylinder storage room. Emergency shutdown of the chlorine feed system is performed at the plants SCADA control center in the plantA?s main office. If there is a power failure, the system automatically shu"

At least one operator is on-site at all times to monitor the system.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe chlorine treatment system commenced operations in March 1996. Since that time there have been no accidents resulting in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Several minor leaks to the system have occurred over the past five years and investigations were performed and documented and recommended changes to procedures were implemented to prevent future incidents from occurring. \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Dixon Water Treatment Plant has an emergency action plan in effect. This plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning section of the Risk Management Program document and was designed to meet the following objectives:\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nThe Dixon Water Treatment Plant's Supervisor is the designated as the emergency action plan coordinator for the plant. The Plan provides the response and notification procedures, evacuation assembly locations, chlorine health hazards, and mitigation procedures and was implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the plant. This Plan is reviewed by the plant emergency coordinator and the ONWASA Safety and Risk Manager and updated at least once per year. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Dixon Water Treatment Plant has taken a pro-active approach to emergency response \nand safety. To improve safety, the chlorine system is routinely inspected and the process audited. The facility conducted its last PSM audit and PHA Revalidation in August of 2010. Recommendations from these studies have been implemented.  In addition, the facility actively pursue following actions over the next year in their continued effort to provid"
