CEC is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community.  CEC staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine for water treatment.  Chlorine plays an important role in water treatment and water reclamation, enabling everyone to lead healthier lives.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe facility has a long-standing commitment to its workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the chlorine system. The facility\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nThe chlorine system at the City of El Centro's Water Treatment Plant is used for the treatment of water from the supply canals prior to pumping into the City's water supply pipelines.\n\nThe Chlorine Storage Room contains 8-10 one-ton chlorine cylinders, one chlorine detector (set @ 1 ppm), automatic switchover valves, one vacuum regulator, and one exhaust fan that is operated manually whenever personnel enter the room.  Two independent manifold systems (one active and the other kept on standby) are connected to a common header that feeds into the Chlorination Room.  City of El Centro Operators use a monorail hoist to replace chlorine cylin"

      "SummaryText": "ders.\n\nThe chlorine system is operated under vacuum conditions.  Each active one-ton cylinder is placed on a scale to allow City of El Centro Operators to plan ahead for ordering more chlorine and for planning the change-out procedure.  Each container is positioned so that the valves are vertically aligned.  A vacuum regulator is mounted directly on the active chlorine cylinder.  A vacuum is created when process water is pumped through the injectors.  This flow generates a vacuum which opens the vacuum regulator.  Upon loss of vacuum in the line from the active one-ton cylinder, a diaphragm in the vacuum regulator will close, stopping any chlorine from escaping.  Any chlorine in the piping upon loss of vacuum will be drawn through the chlorinators and into solution.\n\nScrubbers are not installed in any of the Water Treatment Plant rooms; however, each chlorine detector triggers an alarm that will alert the Operators to a high ambient chlorine concentration in either the Chlorination Room or in the Chlorine Storage Room.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \nPer the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined.  RMP*Comp and SLAB Dispersion modeling were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation. The chlorine cylinders are located in a building; therefore, this passive mitigation measure was incorporated in the calculations.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by regulation.  RMP*Comp and SLAB Dispersion Modeling were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance. \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used.  RMP*Comp and SLAB Dispersion Modeling were used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance.  The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than t"

The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.\n \nRisk Considerations\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the Community; the City of El Centro Water Treatment Plant has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make this type of event non-credible.\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that overpredict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with a chlorine release:\n\u00bfValves to permit isolation of the process exist.\n\u00bfPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus) is used by plant personnel.\n\u00bfThe history of the CEC Water Treatment Plant (i.e., no RMP-applicable chlorine releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely operating the Chlorine System.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key prevention program elements were implemented by the facility to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine systems. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition to the Management Programs, there are chlorine leak detectors situated in all rooms that contain chlorine (2 total).  In the event of a chlorine gas leak, the detectors relay a signal that activates a horn and a light outside the room where chlorine has been detected.  In addition, the alarm is displayed on the control system panel.  At 1 ppm, the alarm signal is directly wired to alert the El Centro Police Department Dispatch.
