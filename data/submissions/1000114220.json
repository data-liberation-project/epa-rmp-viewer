Included in these types of products are items such as spray paints, automobile maintenance products, household products, and industrial and institutional products. The overall production process is a highly integrated operation involving management of incoming chemical and non-chemical raw materials; compounding, blending, mixing and storage of the chemical raw materials into packageable forms; packaging of these compounded materials into aerosol containers; and the temporary accumulation of these packages in warehousing areas prior to shipment.\nOur physical plant site consists of two buildings located on approximately 8.5 acres. The main building, located centrally within the property, contains office, laboratory, warehousing, production, maintenance, and shipping and receiving areas. The other building, designated Building 6, contains laboratory, warehousing, production, and shipping and receiving areas. An adjacent warehouse is also rented for the purpose of storage, approximately 1.3 acres, and stores finished aerosol cans. The plant site also has a propellant storage tank farm that contains 20 tanks of approximately 1,000,000 lbs. of liquified propellant gases; three underground storage tank fields containing 45 tanks of approximately 300,000 gallons of varying chemical ingredients used to fill aerosol cans; one aboveground storage tank area containing one tank of 52,000 gallons of carbon dioxide used to pressurize aerosol cans; two tank truck off-loading areas; and a propellant off-loading area. The warehouse storage space contains approximately 3,800,000 lbs. of propellant in filled aerosol cans at maximum capacity. It is the propellant storage tank farm, the warehouse storage of finished aerosol cans, and the related process of packaging aerosol cans that are the subject of this Risk Management Pla"

We know that many of the raw materials we use are hazardous and that proper operating procedures and employee training programs will minimize the risks associated with those hazards. We have established many operating procedures and have enacted employee safety training programs, both on our own and in conjunction with the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, as well as applicable state codes and regulations, that are designed to prevent system failures that could endanger our employees and the community. Our facility maintains compliance with all applicable regulation, including hazardous waste management, spill prevention programs, EPCRA Tier II and TRI reporting requirements, stormwater pollution prevention, pesticide registration and reporting, and all other applicable federal, state, and local jurisdiction. We maintain an open dialogue with the local fire departments, in addition to an open door policy, that encourages cooperation and guidance. To prevent unintended access by third parties, we do restrict access to the facility to employees, authorized contractors and authorized visitors.\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs described earlier, we are committed to operating our plant safely. To accomplish this, we have reviewed all standard operating procedures, including those required by OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations, as well as those that we developed in order to maintain our operation. We train our employees in those procedures that they are expected to follow in performing their duties and provide review training at appropriate intervals. We installed and maintain automatic devices designed to prevent and respond to th"

We require that these devices, including deluge systems, Fenwal systems, spark or flame detection systems, check valves, automatic shut-offs, and interlocks all be in functioning order before equipment is permitted to be operated. Maintenance and operations employees are trained to prioritize safety above production, and never to operate equipment that is malfunctioning or bypasses these safety systems.\nAdditionally, to limit release volumes and reduce the likelihood of overpressure or overfilling scenarios, all above- and underground storage tanks are only filled to 85% of their maximum intended volume and never permitted to exceed this level.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nNo known accidents resulting in on- or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuation, environmental damage, or other consequence in previous 5 years.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nOur emergency response plan is written to comply with OSHA requirements as well as those of other applicable standards. Situations covered by our plan include fires, tornadoes, hazardous materials incidents, and personal injuries. Actions to be taken in these situations include initial firefighting measures, evacuations, hazardous materials containment procedures, and appropriate first- aid measures. Our facility is a non-responding source for propellant releases and maintains relationships with our local fire department as first responders to any potential incident that may occur.\nAll employees are trained in the proper methods of plant evacuation in the event of a fire. Members of the safety team receive additional training in order to assist in plant response emergencies so that efficient plant evacuations can be effected and that equipment can be secured in appropriate manners until professional help arrives.

All members of the site are trained only to fight incipient-stage fires, to evacuate as a primary response to all fires and hazardous chemical spills, and never to engage with propellant leaks or fires. Employees are instructed to shut down or emergency-stop equipment if it is safe to do so before evacuation to limit potential flammable liquid supply.\nAll fire alarms, whether remotely sensed or manually activated, are automatically transmitted to the local fire department for response. This department is involved in routine inspections of our facility and also in awareness training of other local fire departments at our plant. We conduct fire drills on a quarterly basis, which focus on orderly evacuation to a safe distance away from the facility.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSome changes are planned to improve methods, practices, and equipment for safety on our site. These include improvements to our facility security system to prevent potential intruders from entering the main buildings or tank farms, installing updated and improvement underground storage tank containment, and eliminating operator presence in gas houses or areas where Fenwal systems may deploy. Additionally, we will be reducing volume of stored finished goods in our warehouses. These changes are driven by an intent to provide the safest possible operating system for employees, to reduce the risk of accidental release, and to comply with the full intent of all applicable regulatory requirements. PLZ Bridgeview is committed to being a safe steward of our community, and we welcome opportunities to improve the safety of our operation."
