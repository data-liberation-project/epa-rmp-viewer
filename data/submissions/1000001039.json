Through acquisition and organic growth, they have steadily built upon their greatest assetA?the people. They are their equityA?they are their prized inventory.\nCurrently, U.S. Foodserivce is one of only two national broadline distributors operating in the multibillion-dollar foodservice industry.\nIntegrity is a word you hear a lot these days. It means honesty, honor, character, ethical principles...simply doing the right thing. Out in the open or out of plain view. U.S. Foodservice believes passionately in doing the right thing. ThatA?s why they created the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CRS) program, which focuses on the following areas:\nA? Improving environmental performance in their operations\nA? Creating sustainable offerings through strategic business partnerships\nA? Monogram SustainA?\nA? Marine Stewardship Council certified products\nA? Enriching community engagement where they work and live through partnering with\nFeeding AmericaA? to end hunger in America.\nThier success depends on the quality of their products and service, and on the integrity of their business conduct. ItA?s their commitment to ethics and integrity that drives their decisions.\nTheir associates are required to follow the Code of Conduct. And it doesnA?t stop thereA? U.S. Foodservice holds their colleagues, suppliers, themselves to the highest level of ethical conduct, while offering products that reflect the industryA?s best quality and food safety statement in food-safety technology.\nTheir food-handling processes reflect the industries best and greatly exceed federally mandated HACCP minimums. They protect their products throughout the entire distribution process, constantly checking to ensure the A?cold chainA? is never compromised. This is achieved through stringent standards such as Food Safety & Quality Assurance (FSQA) and their continual investment in food-safety technology.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE P"

Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for their use.  Because of its toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\nUS Food Service is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for their employees and the surrounding community. Their refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119) and Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68).  Their priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  \n\nU.S. FoodserivceA?s RMP program includes elements addressing:\n\n- Employee Participation: involve employeeA?s at all appropriate points in the program.\n- Process Safety Information: maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so that employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: conduct detailed studies of the refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: provide written operating procedures to help staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: train mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: For certain types of major changes, they conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been"

(See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe U.S. Foodservice facility in Oklahoma CIty, OK receives, stores and distributes frozen food.  Temperatures of most of the products are kept below freezing.  These temperatures are regulated through their ammonia refrgieration system.\nThe amount of ammonia stored onsite is 21,000 pounds.  The largest vessel present in the system is the high pressure receiver.  Filled to 80% capacity by NFPA Codes, the maximum quantity in this vessel is 7,111 pounds.  This amount will be used to determine the worst-case release.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into U.S. FoodserviceA?s accident history revealed that there have been zero reportable ammonia releases (> 100 pounds) ove"

In addition, there have been zero injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nU.S. Foodservice has an emergency response plan in effect at the facility.  The Emergency Response Plan (plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the PSM document, which is maintained at the facility.  This plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\nA?    To save lives\nA?    To minimize and avoid injuries\nA?    To protect the environment\nA?    To minimize property damage\n\nU.S. Foodservice Maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nThrough their RMP program, US Food Service looks continuously for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in their facility.\n\n\n"
