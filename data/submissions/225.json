If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Allamakee County LEPC and Postville Fire Department and respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substance handled.\nThis facility is a wholesale supplier of anhydrous ammonia to farmers. Storage of anhydrous ammonia is year around at our location. Primary transfer of anhydrous ammonia to farm nurse tanks is done in the spring from April to July and in fall after harvest from October until  applaciation is restricted. Storage consists of two 30,000 gallon tanks.  Transfer is done with hoses, valves,and related equipment.\n\nThe worst-case scenario.\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud floating over the ground until it disperses.  According to EPA's  RMP Comp tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. The total population would be 1143 people involved with a release and business, industry, school and parks included in the affected area.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.              \nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed and maintained according to OSHA, federal, state, and local regulations.\n\n Five-year accident history. \nThe Postville Farmer's Cooperative Society has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency respose program.\nIn the event of an emergency in"
