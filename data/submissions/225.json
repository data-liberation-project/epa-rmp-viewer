Storage of anhydrous ammonia is year around at our location. Primary transfer of anhydrous ammonia to farm nurse tanks is done in the spring from April to July and in fall after harvest from October until  applaciation is restricted. Storage consists of two 30,000 gallon tanks.  Transfer is done with hoses, valves,and related equipment.\n\nThe worst-case scenario.\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a vapor cloud floating over the ground until it disperses.  According to EPA's  RMP Comp tables, the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles. The total population would be 1143 people involved with a release and business, industry, school and parks included in the affected area.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.              \nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.
