INDSPEC also manufactures resorcinol-based resins and other resorcinol derivatives.  INDSPEC's quality materials, strong environmental and safety policies combined with a reliable supply chain and customer service, secures its position as an industry leader in resorcinol. \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source (? 68.155(a))\n\n\n\nAs a RESPONSIBLE CARE; Company, INDSPEC Chemical Corporation has established systems for the safe operation of the processes at this facility that facilitates the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. INDSPEC's focus is on workplace and environmental safety which is good for the environment as well as protecting our employees and our surrounding communities.  One component of these systems is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Petrolia, PA facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR PART 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and requirements of OSHA 1910.119. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Petrolia, PA facility.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (AA? 68.155(b))\n\n\n\nThe INDSPEC Chemical Corporation Petrolia facility handles 3 substances that are regulated by the RMP rule.  The facility conducted a threshold determination consistent with 40 CFR 68.115 and has identified three substances that are regulated under the Risk Management Plan (RMP): Oleum (CAS Number 8014-95-7), Formaldehyde (CAS Number 50-00-0) and Ethyl Ether (CAS Number 60-29-7). \n\n\n\n\n\nReview of Worst-case and Alternate Releas"
