In business at the same location since 1977, the company is a quality bulk\nstorage/distribution facility for propylene and butadiene.    Butadiene is shipped to companies\naround the United States, who in turn use the chemical to produce products such as tires,\nautomotive parts, roofing materials, wire and cable coating, etc.  Propylene, which is shipped\nto companies in Texas, is a key ingredient used to produce plastic and rubber products.\n\nIntercontinental Terminals Company has two chemicals in threshold quantities affected by the\nrule - 1,3 butadiene and propylene.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe hazard assessments were done using the EPA supplied \"look-up tables\" for the Worst\nCase Scenarios (WCS) and Alternate Release Scenarios (ARS).\n\nThe WCS for flammables is the total release of the entire contents of 1,3 butadiene from a\nrefrigerated tank.  The entire volume is assumed to vaporize instantaneously and ignite,\nresul"

Although we have numerous controls to prevent such\nreleases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was\ntaken into account in evaluating this WCS.  This WCS has offsite impacts.\n\nThe ARS involves the failure of a gasket on the 10\" tank suction line on a butadiene storage\ntank.  The ARS has the potential for limited offsite impact.\n\n\fGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general Accident Prevention Program in place at the\nAnchorage Chemical Terminal.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented\nbecause some processes at the plant meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA\nProcess Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, Intercontinental Terminals\nCompany has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at the\nAnchorage Chemical Terminal that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program and this\nsummary describes OIMS.  Further, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a\nvalid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\nThe Intercontinental Terminals Company encourages associates to participate in all facets of\nprocess safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of associate participation\nrange from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a\nmember of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team.  Associates have access to all information\ngenerated from HAZOPs and Site Risk Assessments.  In addition, the plant has a number of\ninitiatives underway that address process safety and associate safety issues via the ACT Safety\nCommittee which is comprised of site personnel and selected contractors.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to\nhelp maintain safe operation of the precesses.  These documents address chemical"

The ACT Terminal Manager is\nresponsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the\nreference documents and their location is readily available as part of the OIMS documentation\nto help associates locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure\ntreatment considerations, is provided in Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).  This\ninformation is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns\nand any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific\nprocess areas, the plant has identified operating envelopes, i.e., documented safety related\nlimits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.  The plant\nensures that the process is maintained within these limits using computerized process controls\nand monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e.,\nautomated shutdown systems, alarm systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the\ndesign and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of\nconstruction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This\ninformation, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis\nfor establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as form evaluating proposed\nprocess and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards\nassociated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough\nhazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have\noperating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA\nteam identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and\nmitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation\nmeasures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team finding are forwarded to local management for resolution.  Implementation of\nmitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk evaluation done by\nthe PHA team.  This evaluation helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned greater\nrisk receive attention first.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to\nPHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is\ndocumented and retained.\n\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from\nthe original design safety features, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal periodically updates and\nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every\nfive years for the life of the process.  The results and findings from these updates are\ndocumented and retained.

This information, along\nwith written operating procedures, is readily available to operators and for other personnel to\nuse as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\fThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has long-standing safe work practices in place to help\nensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/\npresence/exit of support personnel; (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of\nenergy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance; (3) a procedure for safe removal of\nhazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened; (4) a permit and procedure\nto control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work); and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure\nthat adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures\n(and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure that\noperations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTRAINING\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Anchorage Chemical\nTerminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all associates involved in\noperating a process.

Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions\nas intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (i.e., adequate wall\nthickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, associates will correct the\ndeficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a MOC team will\nreview the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe\noperation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance.  The\nAnchorage Chemical Terminal incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment\npurchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use\nand that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nHOT WORK\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a Work Permit System in place to protect personnel,\nsite facilities, and the surrounding community.  The purpose of the Work Permit System is to\nensure that jobs are planned, equipment is prepared, personnel are informed to hazards and\nprocedures, precautions are taken, and work is executed in a manner to protect safety, health,\nand the environment.  The Work Permit System covers hot work and other categories of work\nsuch as opening equipment, excavation, lifting, and confined spaces.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has a comprehensive system to manage changes to\nprocesses.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals,\ntechnology (including process operating c"

Changes are reviewed to (1)\nensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that\nexisting controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard\ninformation, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are\nupdated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are\nprovided any necessary training before the change is implemented.\n\n\fINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or\nreasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, gas release, major property damage,\nenvironmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts\nand develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. \nThe investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a\nrecurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions\nare taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked\nuntil they are complete.  The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented\nand the investigation results are reviewed with all associates (including contractors) who could\nbe affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years\nso that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\nTo help ensure that Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) management systems are\nfunctioning properly, the Anchorage Chemical Terminal periodically conducts audits to\ndetermine whether the procedures and practices required by the OIMS are being implemented.\n\nCompliance audits are conducted semi-annually and external SHE audits are conducted at least\nevery three years.

Prevention activities in place at ACT help prevent potential\naccident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\n\nIn addition to the prevention activities, the plant has safety features on many units to help, (1)\nquickly detect a release, (2) contain/control a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of\n(mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n     Release Detection\n\n     1.   Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n     Release Containment/Control\n\n     1.   Process relieve valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate\n          episodic releases\n\n     2.   Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n\n     3.   Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (i.e., high level,\n          high temperature)\n\n     4.   Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n     5.   Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e., backup firewater pump)\n\n     6.   Atmospheric relief devices\n\n     Release Mitigation\n\n     1.   Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n\n     2.   Deluge system for specific equipment\n\n     3.   Trained emergency response personnel\n\n     4.   Personal protective equipment (i.e., protective clothing, self-contained breathing\n          apparatus)\n\n     5.   Blast resistant buildings to help protect control systems and personnel\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Anchorage Chemical Terminal has an excellent record of accident prevention over the life\nof the facility.
