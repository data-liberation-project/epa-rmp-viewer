To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.\n\nThe concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in shipping containers. Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.  \n\nAquarion Water Company of Connecticut is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through emergency management agencies.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nTo ensure that a chemical release does not occur, the Mianus Plant maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine. The prevention program has twelve elements designed to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAquarion Water Company of Connecticut is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Manager of Supply Operations has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  Other key plant supervisory staff also have clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety \nManagement requirements.\n\nOur prevention measures include the u"

If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the local emergency responders who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release. \n\nPlanned Changes to "

The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization. We have recently assessed further safety enhancements to the facility and are in the process of implementing them. We continue this process on an ongoing basis. We are also planning to convert from chlorine use to a less hazardous disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite solution, in the near future. Sodium hypochlorite solution is not a gas. As a result, it does not have the same potential for chlorine gas migration if it were accidentally released"
