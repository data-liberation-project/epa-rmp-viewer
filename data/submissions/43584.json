Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, the equipment will be repaired in a timely manner. All outstanding deficiencies are tracked until such time a final solution has been implemented and documented.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The LCCC incorporates quality assurance into equipment purchase and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long standing safe work program in place to ensure worker safety. Examples of the program include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedures to conduct spark producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedures to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a  confined space. These procedures, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so similar incidents can be prevented. The LCCC trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation. The investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.

Employees are consulted and/or informed about all aspects of the RMP prevention program including PHA\u00bfs (Process Hazard Analysis) and operating procedures.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) audits the covered processes to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing safety, health, and environmental issues. The complex assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the processes. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to ensure safe operation of the complex. The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements made to the operations of the LCCC.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has established a program to help ensure that contractor activities are performed in a safe manner. This program reviews the safety record of the contractors to ensure the plant only hires contractors who can safety perform the desired task. The complex communicates to the contractor supervisor the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, the plants safe work practices, and the plants emergency response procedures. The plant requires that the contractor supervisors train each of their employees on hazards and procedures specific to the complex site. \nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has experienced zero events, which had offsite impacts, in the period of October 1999 to present. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of highly qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\n\nSasol is committed to Responsible Care\u00ae voluntary initiative for safe management of chemicals. Sasol follows the Responsible Care\u00ae Code of Management Practice, which is integral to the implementation of the Sasol Environmental, Health and Safety policies. The Responsible Care\u00ae Community Awareness Code of Management Practice and Sasol\u00bfs Community Awareness and Emergency Response policies are designed to assist emergency preparedness and for faster community right to know.\n\nSasol\u00bfs Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butane, propylene, ethane, butane, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPS\u00bfs list of toxic chemicals and are above EPS\u00bfs threshold quantity are ethylene oxide and hydrogen fluoride. Other regulated chemicals used in our process, which are stored below the threshold quantity, are sulphur dioxide, ammonia and chlorine.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest rank receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA findings are tracked until they are complete.

This training includes training on specific types of equipment, such as pumps and compressors, general overview of the process, properties and hazard substances in the process, and detailed review of complex procedures, such as, safe work practices and of emergency response. Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training material before a new employee can report to a process unit. Once a new employee reports to a particular process unit, he receives detailed training with respect to process specific procedures and for specific tasks; he is allowed to begin work in a specific operating unit.\n\nRefresher training covers (1) a general overview of the process, (2) the properties and hazards of the substances in the process and, (3) a review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices. Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process. The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training. Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Management of Change program for the LCCC evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes to help ensure that a change does not negatively affect safe operations.
