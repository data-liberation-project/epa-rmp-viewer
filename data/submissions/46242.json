Headquartered in Mt. Sterling, Illinois, DOT is a family owned business that has grown from a single station wagon driven by the founder, Robert Tracy, to a fleet of over 400 multi-temp tractor trailers. This growth is in large part due to the customer driven attitude that is exhibited by all the members of the Dot team.  As stated on their website, \u00bf Dot Foods will continue to be driven by the values of integrity, growth, profit, and customer satisfaction, with emphasis on innovation and employee welfare.\u00bf\n\nDOT Foods\u00bf senior management is not only committed to offer superior service, but also maintain a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  DOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility who will respond to minor leaks.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe DOT Foods ammonia refrigeration system has been in operation since 2004.  Changes/modifications have taken place since the completion of the facility.  The ammonia refrigeration process was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  The facility is located at 3411 Cypert Way, in Ardmore, Oklahoma.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses 28,800 pounds of ammonia for dock operat"

The condensers are mounted on the machine room roof, the water tank is located in the existing machine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold storage rooms/areas.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe DOT Foods facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of ammonia refrigeration systems.  These safety features include a water diffusion tank, ammonia sensors in the new and existing engine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas, and automatic shut down systems.    In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on the engine room roof (condensers). \n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of the process solution that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds over the past five years or any release or threatened release of a hazardous material.  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from a process solution release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nDOT Foods maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

      "SummaryText": "viewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to the renovation of the facility.  \n\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest to the leak will alert any personnel in the immediate area who are unaware of the danger, and the DOT Foods Freezer Maintenance Operator (if he/she is present).  He/she will then use a portable radio to inform the Incident Commander (Facility Manager) and the other managers and contractors of the situation.\nThe DOT Foods on-duty engineer (Refrigeration Engineer if present) will determine what procedures and personnel are necessary to remedy the problem. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe initial Process Hazard Analysis was conducted in December 2004, which generated mitigation measures (recommendations) to improve safety at the DOT Foods facility located at 3411 Cypert Way, Ardmore, Oklahoma.  DOT Foods\u00bf safety committee has completed all recommended items, in a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.Continue to train all employees in Process Safety Management and the facility\u00bfs Safety Plan/Programs.\n\n2.Continue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\n\n3.Continue employee involvement through safety team participation.\n\n4.Continue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."
