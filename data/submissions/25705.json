Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Berne Co-op Association, Mapleton, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage, handling and sale of fertilizers and other agri-chemicals to local farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application as a crop production nutrient. It is stored in one (1) 11,000 gallon steel storage tank and 30 - 1,000 gallon steel nurse tanks. The maximum amount stored is estimated to be about 177,750 pounds. \n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios:  A) The Worst Case Release Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the largest storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released is estimated to be about 47,700 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank (11,000 gallons) at 85 % capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the end-point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is estimated to be about 1.7 miles.  B) The Alternate Case Release Scenario, based on the five year accident history of the facility, or the most likely incident, is a release from a 3\" transfer hose. The maximum amount released is estimated to be about 26,640 pounds and would be released over a period of 2 minutes until an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes. The distance to the end-point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is estimated to be about 1.6 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance"

      "SummaryText": "with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) and the standards of the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The ANSI standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21, Chapter 43, Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to the best of our knowledge, have resulted in any off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, peoperty damage or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program:  The facility has:  A) a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in accordance with OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.38 and B) provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
