At the facility railcars are stored on the property until the product is needed for supply at the Ray Energy rail terminal. Odorized propane is the only substance regulated under the risk management program that is present at the Whitehall yard facility in amounts above the threshold. The program is classified as Program Level 1 under the regulation.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention program and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by Ray Energy. These high standards include, operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations, operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized. and correcting non- compliance issues found during regular audits of the facility.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Whitehall yard does not operate under the guidelines of OSHA Process Safety Management Program since the facility is normally unmanned and remote. Since the facility has no public receptors within the worst case scenario distance , the facility is a program level 1. No specific prevention program is required.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nNo incident resulting in on site injuries, death, or property damage or off site impacts from a pr"

Also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the County Regional Planning Commission. The facility operator is responsible for coordinating the notifications required to initiate an emergency response. The emergency response plan provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCompliance with the environmental, health, and safety management systems forms the framework for continuous safety improvements. Specific actions will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety include, compliance audits will ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements, continue a relationship with the local fire department to ensure a state of readiness to   respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops, and continue to offer the Propane Emergencies training to all agencies involved."
