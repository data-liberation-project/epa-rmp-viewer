The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications mad"

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary - Cowtown Gas Plant\r\n\r\nCowtown Gas Processing Partners L.P., owner and operator of the Cowtown Gas Plant, has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Cowtown's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nNatural gas is gathered from wells in the surrounding fields and sent to Cowtown for processing prior to being sold for domestic consumption. This gas contains impurities in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. These impurities must be brought into specification before residue companies will purchase this gas. Cowtown inlet gas contains enough natural gas liquids that extraction is desirable.\r\n\r\nTwo Cryogenic plants are in place to remove liquids prior to sales of residue gas. The plants together are capable of handling 225 MMSCFD.\r\n\r\nGas flow into this facility is at low pressure; approximately 90 psig. Processing and sales line pressures range from 1000 to 1050 psig; therefore this gas requires boost compression. Cowtown has several gas fired engine driven compression units that boost gas pressure up to processing pressure. Gas is treated with triethylene glycol (TEG) and molecular sieve beds to remove any water that may be entrained in the gas. Cryogenic processing at very low temperatures removes virtually all of the ethane and heavier components.\r\n\r\nCowtown is designed to remove CO2 from liquid product with a solution of amine and water. Once these liquids are sweetened, product is sweet and any entrained water is removed using coalescer type filters. The amine unit operates in a conti"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \r\n\r\nCowtown Gas Processing Partners L.P. primarily used the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform this evaluation.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Cowtown Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted when major changes occur at the facility.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings ar"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Cowtown Gas Plant maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedence for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Cowtown Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.
