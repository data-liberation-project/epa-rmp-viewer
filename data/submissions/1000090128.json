      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nPursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, Section 112(r), this Risk Management Plan (RMP) document addresses the risk management plan for the Fresno Cogeneration Partners (FCP) facility located near San Joaquin, Fresno County, California. This RMP also includes all the elements of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA). The FCP facility which is owned by Fresno Cogeneration Partners, L.P., and operated by Wellhead Services, Inc. (WSI), is in the business of power production and uses anhydrous ammonia (Chemical Abstract Service [CAS] #7664-41-7) a regulated substance, and aqueous ammonia (CAS #1336-21-6) also a regulated substance. This RMP document has been prepared in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Guidance Document dated June 8, 2004 (California Code of Regulations [CCR], Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5). The PSM section has been repared in accordance with Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations Section 5189. \n\n\n\nThe FCP plant processes and stores ammonia in quantities above the Federal and State regulatory threshold quantities and therefore, is submitting this RMP. A Program 3 RMP is being submitted due to the proximity of the facility to off site receptors.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWSI has an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that is used to respond to emergency situations. The plan consists of reporting and notification, mitigation, evacuation, emergency response assistance, and medical assistance procedures. \n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activity at the FCP facility is to generate electricity for sale. The facility is located in a rural part of Fresno County and includes a 55 megawatt (MW) cogeneration unit (Cogeneration Unit) and a 23 MW simple-cycle peaking gas turbine unit (Peaking Unit). The Cogeneration Unit is driven by a 45-MW "

      "SummaryText": "General Electric LM6000 stationary combustion gas turbine (CGT). The Peaking Unit is driven by a 23 MW Pratt and Whitney FT4A9 gas turbine\n\n\n\nThe Cogeneration Unit is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to control emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) by injecting anhydrous ammonia (NH3) into the exhaust gas stream upstream of a catalyst. The anhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in a 12,000 gallon aboveground pressure vessel. The maximum operating capacity of the vessel is 9,984 liquid gallons (56,800 pounds) with a heel volume of 216 gallons and a vapor space of 1,800 gallons. From the vessel, ammonia vapor is injected into an air stream for injection into the SCR grid.\n\n\n\nThe Peaking Unit is in simple-cycle configuration exhausting through an oxidation catalyst and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to control emissions of NOX by injecting a 19% solution of aqueous ammonia (NH4OH). The aqueous ammonia is stored onsite in a 7000 gallon aboveground vertical tank at atmospheric pressure.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific\n\nPrevention Steps\n\nWSI is dedicated to operating a safe facility. WSI employees are trained in every aspect of hazardous materials management, from using personal protective equipment (PPE) to performing maintenance on facility equipment. All employees are trained in emergency evacuation procedures. A written program for maintaining and inspecting the ongoing integrity of all regulated substance process equipment ensures that equipment receives appropriate, regularly scheduled maintenance. Regular inspections document and identify the condition and reliability of each piece of equipment. Maintenance on all tanks containing ammonia is performed weekly (unless otherwise stated) and consists of visual inspection and preventive maintenance activities. General tank condition is inspected and maintenance performed when deemed necessary. Changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and"

      "SummaryText": " procedures will be implemented when necessary. Before a process change occurs, management of change protocol will be implemented to ensure a safe and smooth transition.\n\n\n\nWSI performs a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for the ammonia tanks and for any modification significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. The prestartup safety review shall confirm that, prior to the introduction of regulated substances, the process conforms to all specified regulations and safety requirements.\n\n\n\nWSI shall also report any events that may lead to impacts onsite or offsite, regardless of whether or not an actual impact does occur, according to the incident investigation program contained herein.\n\n\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWSI has an excellent safety record. There have not been any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia nor aqueous ammonia within the last five years that resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nWSI recognizes that an effective risk management program involves continuous improvement and is committed to providing a safe environment for its employees, customers, and the surrounding area. Improvements are implemented when possible to support this commitment. These improvements may include upgrading equipment maintenance procedures, training requirements, operating procedures, or system controls. When possible, a less hazardous substance will be substituted for a chemical currently used in the process.\n\n\n\nPrior to implementing any changes to these chemical systems, WSI employees will follow written Management of Change procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and facilities. These written procedures address the following issues:\n\n\n\n?    Technical basis for the proposed change(s)\n\n?    Impact of the proposed change(s) on health,"

Written operating procedures will be updated as needed.\n\n\n\nWhen nonconformance conditions are identified, WSI takes the following measures:\n\n\n\n?    Shutdown of processes and operations.\n\n?    Collecting and containing released waste.\n\n?    Removing or isolating containers.\n\n?    Monitoring for leaks, ruptures, etc.\n\n?
