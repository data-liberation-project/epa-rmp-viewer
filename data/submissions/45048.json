Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. In addition, it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.\n\nShell Rock Ag Inc. Corporate Mission includes, To provide for the safety of our employees, our customers and the general public. In order to fulfill this mission, Shell Rock Ag Inc. provides a corporate EHS group to maintain and administer comprehensive safety and environmental programs and procedures. EHS field safety services supervisors audit and monitor the safety standards of the company.\n\nAll locations are required to conduct their own internal audit utilizing checklist type survey forms that are updated regularly to ensure that all OSHA, EPA, DOT, and related state and local regulatory issues are covered. The EHS group conducts comprehensive annual audits at every location to measure regulatory compliance including those governing the sage handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia. The supervisors require a written response with the completion date of all recommendations resulting from the audits.\n\nEach location has appointed an in-house site safety coordinator, as an extension of the EHS group. These coordinators are given special training to monitor the day to day safe work activities, maintain the required regulatory record keeping, conduct monthly safety meetings and act as the location's direct contact with the corporate EHS group. The site safety coordinators act as the location emergency contact.\n\nA DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nThis facility is a wholesale fertilizer and agricultural chemical distribution center. Anhydrous Ammonia is handled and stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program. We distribute anhydrous ammonia to grower cu"

Our storage consists of (5) 1000 gallon storage tank(s), 30 nurse tanks, 9 application toolbars and all associated appurtenances.\n\nTHE WORST CASE SCENARIO\nOur worst case scenario is the loss of the entire contents of the 18,000 gallon storage tank, when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85%), resulting in a liquid spill and vaporization. According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint is 0.94 miles. This particular scenario was chosen because it has the potential for off-site impact although Shell Rock Ag Inc. has never had an incident involving the loss of the entire contents of any storage tank.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\nThis facility complies with the ANSI K 61.1 standards, OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11), ASTM standards and the ASME codes as well as all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations. The ammonia system was designed, installed and maintained in accordance with 1989 ANSI standards.\n\nOur ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs and emergency shutoff valves. The load-out risers used for the purpose of filling the nurse tanks are protected by excess flow valves and fill line breakaways to immediately stop the flow of ammonia if a line or a hose fails. All of the main storage tanks valves and the riser load valves are locked when not in use.\n\nOur ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented. Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, relief valves, etc. Are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\nTraining is provided to all employees annually, whenever there is a change in the process"

In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility. This will help to ensure that our community has the strategy for responding to and mitigation the threat posed by an ammonia release. This complies with the requirement for our facility to be included in the community emergency response plan prepared under EPCRA.\n\nIn addition, Shell Rock Ag Inc. has an Emergency Response and Contingency Plan for each facility that complies with the requirements of OSHA (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.120).The plans includes ???????\n\nShell Rock Ag Inc. provides for a network of responders by training and certifying employees in OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (Hazwoper) Plan regulations. This provides quick access to trained assistance for a release or other incident.???????\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY.\nWe do not plan to make any changes to the physical site. We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all of the safe ammonia transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all of the ammonia equipment."
