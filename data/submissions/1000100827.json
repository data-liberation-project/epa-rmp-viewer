All relief valves at the facility are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient.\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nAccording to Fresh Leaf Farms personnel, there has been no releases of anhydrous ammonia in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nFresh Leaf Farms is a non-responding facility. Facility only responds to situations that are within their capabilities. These may include, emergency shutdown, equipment isolation and pumping down the system. No emergency response actions or site clean-up that are beyond the capabilities of the refrigeration personnel will be performed. In case of an emergency, incident will be reported immediately to Facility Managers, and RMP Program Coordinator (RMP Administrator). The RMP Program Coordinator is responsible for assisting county emergency responders upon arrival on site. This may include contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release. The RMP Program Coordinator will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required.\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in RMP Binder Chapter"

A list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder.

International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix 12 of the RMP Binder, describe equipment details.\r\nThe refrigeration system at this facility is a single-stage vapor compression cycle. In general, the process chemistry for the refrigeration system is provided in Chapter 8 of the RMP Binder.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.4 for Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nFresh Leaf Farms maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze releases for ways to prevent a similar future release, see Appendix 16-Incident Investigation in the RMP Binder. The ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. There are emergency"

Glycol chiller skids operate as connected to main system during the season when they are onsite. There is also a portable vacuum cooling system (vacuum tube and refrigeration trailer) that is operated connected to the fixed house system. Refrigeration trailer will operate mostly as standalone and only help the house system when the house suction raises above certain pressure. Vacuum cooling system has one half-car vacuum tube and one refrigeration trailer, which is comprised of pressure vessels, compressor, evaporative condenser and ammonia pump. The facility operates seasonally from approximately April 15 through November 15. The facility pumps down all the ammonia in the system to the high-pressure receiver and low-pressure receiver during the off-season. All of the refrigeration equipment except the condenser, diffusion tank, cold room fan coil valve stations and piping headers and vacuum cooling system are located indoors. At the end of the season, vacuum tube and refrigeration trailer ships to Yuma, AZ facility for winter operations, from November to April.\r\n\r\nAll compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. Refrigeration control system sends alarms to refrigeration manager in case of emergency situation or any high pressure, high temperature or ammonia detection. All pressure vessels and compressors are protected against high-pressure situations by safety relief valves. There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and mechanical rooms for alarming. There are assigned responders (refrigeration contractors) experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond to and determine specific actions for any incident.\r\n\r\nThe total ammonia charge of the refrigeration system at the facility is approximately 11,135 lb.

      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nFresh Leaf Farms conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required. On-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. The refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response. Emergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nFresh Leaf Farms facility acts as the stationary source for the regulated substance anhydrous ammonia, which is used as a refrigerant in their cold storage, vacuum cooling, and glycol & water chilling operations. See Chapter 8 Appendix 8.1 of the RMP binder for the drawings showing the facility location map and site plan.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system at the facility is composed of both fixed and portable equipment. Fixed system includes screw and reciprocating type compressors, evaporative condenser, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, cold room fan coils (evaporators), makeup water chiller, glycol chillers, water storage tank, ammonia detection, control systems, and a diffusion tank."
