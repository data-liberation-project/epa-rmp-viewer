      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nThe Amesbury Water Treatment Plant (WTP) accidental release prevention\npolicy involves a consolidated approach that integrates technologies,\nprocedures, and management practices.  All applicable procedures of the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed.  The\nWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans\nthat are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services\navailable in the community, and meets the EPA Emergency \nResponse Program requirements.\n\nThe Amesbury WTP, located at Rings Corner, Newton Road, Amesbury, Massachusetts, uses\nchlorine to obtain proper disinfection for both pre-treatment and\npost-treatment practices.  The WTP presently utilizes chlorine gas for\ndisinfection to meet water quality standards.    Ten 150-lb containers of\npressurized liquid chlorine are connected to the treatment train, six\ncontainers connected to the pre-treatment system and four containers\nconnected to the post-treatment system.  The amount of 150-lb chlorine containers in storage peaks at thirty, therefore a maximum of forty 150-lb containers may be at the Amesbury Water Treatment Plant at\none time.  \n\nAny facility which handles, manufactures, uses or stores any of the toxic\nand flammable substances listed in 40 CFR Section 68.130 above the specified\nthreshold quantities in a process is required to develop and implement a\nrisk management plan.  The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA)\nrequire the EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken\nby facilities to prevent accidental releases of such hazardous chemicals\ninto the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact on the public and the\nenvironment.  Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 addresses\nthe specifications and guidelines for development of risk management\nprograms.  If a facility is subject to part 68, it's risk management program\nmust be in compliance no later than June 21, 1999.  The C"

      "SummaryText": "ity has contracted\nwith Camp Dresser & McKee Inc. to assist in the completion of a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the WTP including a risk management plan.  \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release\nscenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario.\"\nEPA defines the first scenario, which states that \"the owner or operator\nshall assume that the  . . .  maximum quantity in the largest vessel  . . .\nis released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The\nalternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case\nrelease scenario.\" \n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the\ndistance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration\ndecreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 ppm (chlorine), which\nis the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The American\nIndustrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) defines this as the \"maximum airborne\nconcentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could\nbe exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing\nirreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair\nan individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential\npopulation within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint\ndistance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially\naffected.\"\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves the catastrophic failure of a\n150-lb chlorine cylinder outside the chlorine storage room.  The offsite\nconsequence analysis for this scenario was predefined by the EPA.  This\nanalysis assumed that the vessel would completely release all of its\ncontents in ten minutes.  The toxic endpoint used was the one-hour average\nERPG-2.  The population residing within a full circle with a radius\ncorresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was determined. \n\nFor the worst-case modeling analysis, the EPA-mandated meteorological\nconditi"

These correspond to Stability F, wind speed of 1.5\nm/s, highest daily temperature of 77oF and an average humidity of 50%.\n\nFrom the modeling results, it was concluded that the radius which\ncorresponded to the toxic endpoint distance was 0.8 miles.  Within the 0.8\nmiles, approximately 1,100 people would be affected by this EPA-specified\nrelease and the corresponding conditions.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the release of chlorine from a 3/8\ninch diameter whip connected to a 150-lb cylinder.  In this case, however,\nthe release is inside a building. With the operating pressure of 120 psi,\nthe release rate was calculated as 22.2 lb/min.  This rate would release the\nentire contents of the 150-lb cylinder in approximately 7 minutes.  Liquid\nchlorine released from the ruptured whip would flash immediately to a vapor.\n\n\nAs required by EPA, the alternative release scenario was formatted as\nmeteorological conditions of Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 m/s, average air\ntemperature of 50oF, and average humidity of 50 percent.  The fact that the\nrelease happens in an enclosed building allows enclosures to be an act of\npassive mitigation.  Based on these conditions, the off-site impact extends\n0.2 miles.  \n\nThe general WTP accidental release prevention program is based on the\nfollowing critical elements:\n\n          High level of training of operators\n\n         Preventive maintenance program\n\n         Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\n         Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written\nwith the participation of the operators\n\n         Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\n         Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nChemical-specific preventions steps include availability of self-contained\nbreathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by the operators during\nconnection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and\ntoxic properties of chlorine, and presence of chlorine detectors.\n\nNo accidental releases of c"
