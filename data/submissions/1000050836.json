The Hargesheimer WTP produces potable water for the City of Abilene, as well as for wholesale customers supplied through neighboring communities and water supply corporations. Chlorine gas is used in the disinfection process at the plant.  Up to 16,000 pounds of chlorine may be stored at the Hargesheimer WTP. Because the stored quantity of chlorine onsite exceeds the threshold quantity for chlorine (\u00a768.130; Table 1), the City developed this Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Hargesheimer WTP is subject to Program 2 RMP requirements (\u00a768.12(c)).  A Management System overseen by the City's Director of Water Utilities (Director) is implemented to ensure that the RMP and associated Prevention Program are implemented correctly and maintained up-to-date. \r\n\r\nThe Prevention Program designed to prevent accidental releases includes all required elements of 40 CFR Part 68.  The TCEQ licensing program for water operators is used as a training tool, along with site-specific RMP training.  TCEQ licensing testing and on-site observation and demonstration are used to evaluate comprehension of all training materials.  Written operating procedures are used in conjunction with on-the-job training to ensure that certified WTP operators are proficient in performing their duties before being allowed to work with chlorine storage and feed systems.  Certified WTP operators conduct daily inspections and any problems with the chlorine systems are corrected and documented.  In addition, the certified WTP operators ensure that the equipment used in the disinfection process is maintained according to the manufacturers' recommendations (\u00a768.56(a)).  Because of these efforts, the Hargesheimer WTP has not had a chlorine release that resulted in an injury, either on-site or off-site, within t"

As part of the Program, the City will periodically perform compliance audits, hazard reviews and incident investigations, according to a predetermined schedule described in the RMP and as needs dictate.  These compliance audits and hazard reviews document any planned changes to improve safety (\u00a768.50 & \u00a768.58).\r\n\r\nThe Hargesheimer WTP complies with the emergency response regulations per Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR \u00a71910.38, as well as with applicable fire codes and the standards set forth by the Chlorine Institute.  The Hargesheimer WTP is a non-responding facility for emergency response. The City of Abilene's Office of Emergency Management maintains a community-wide Emergency Response Plan which encompasses the Hargesheimer WTP. Per the City's Emergency Response Plan WTP operators are trained to notify the City's Fire Department via call to 9-1-1 in the event of a release from the Hargesheimer WTP.  The City of Abilene's Fire Department will serve as the first responder and coordinate the emergency response according to the City's Emergency Response Plan, including the evacuation of surrounding residents when required (\u00a768.90(b))."
