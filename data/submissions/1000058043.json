The RMP is required under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program codified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68). \n\n\n\nABR conducts refining operations in Areas 1 and 2 (EPA Facility ID 1000 0014 7815).  Areas 1 and 2 are not contiguous or adjacent to Area 3.   Therefore, separate RMP submittals are prepared.  Area 3 was formerly operated as a delayed coker.  However, refining operations in area 3 have been temporarily suspended and formerly covered processes have been de-inventoried.  Currently operated at Area 3 is a tank farm, which uses refinery fuel gas to provide an inert atmosphere for vapor recovery.   \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Program is to identify and prevent potential accidental releases of specific \"regulated substances\", or hazardous chemicals identified by the EPA, that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment. ABR has various \"regulated substances\" in quantities above the threshold amounts.\n\n\n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\n\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABR\n\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances at ABR\n\nSection 3: Worst Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nSection 4: ABR Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSection 5: Five-Year Accidental Release Summary\n\nSection 6: Emergency Response Program\n\nSection 7: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at ABR\n\nEquipment at the various units is designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable internal engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

Written policies and procedures are in place to ensure:\n\n\n\n* The safety and health of employees and other workers at the site;\n\n* Protection of the environment;\n\n* Reliable and efficient operation of the facilities;\n\n* Minimization of the risk of product or property losses; and\n\n* Maintaining a positive relationship with the communities adjacent to our facility.\n\n\n\nThese written policies and standards are discussed further elsewhere in this submittal.\n\n\n\nSection 2. Overview of Regulated Substances at ABR\n\nABR purchased refining assets from Big West of California, LLC on June 1, 2010.  Prior to Big West of California's ownership, the Area 3 facility was owned by Shell, Equilon, Texaco and Independent Valley Energy Company (IVEC).  The Area 3 facility has most recently operated as a delayed coking unit processing feeds from and returning intermediates to Areas 1 and 2, as an integrated refinery complex.  However, ABR currently processes vacuum gas oil as feedstock rendering the delayed coking process unnecessary.  At this time, formerly covered processes and storage tanks have been de-inventoried.  ABR currently operates a tank farm at Area 3 which uses vapor recovery to control emissions from storage tanks.  The blanket gas used is refinery fuel gas, which is a mixture of hydrogen, methane and ethane primarily.  This blanket gas exists on site in the vapor space of tanks and in excess of the applicability threshold for flammable mixtures.\n\n\n\nBelow is a summary listing the covered process units that are subject to the federal Risk Management\n\nProgram, defining the appropriate RMP program level, and identifying the regulated substances ha"

Worst-Case Release Scenarios and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nOff-site consequence analyses are essential in identifying potential hazards of accidental releases. The results of these analyses are used to assist the Kern County Environmental Health Services Department and Fire Department in their emergency response planning.\n\n\n\n3.1 Worst-Case Scenario\n\nABR conducted off-site consequence analyses for the worst-case scenarios (WCS) using the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp software which fully incorporates methodology and equations. This methodology was used because the RMP rule has set forth specific criteria that must be followed for modeling the worst-case scenarios. These worst-case scenarios must incorporate very conservative, simplified assumptions about the nature of the releases and the resulting emission rates into the air.\n\n\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case release scenario as one that results in the greatest distance from the point of release to a specified endpoint. In this case, the specified overpressure from a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) is used for flammable substances.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a regulated flammable substance is one in which the total quantity of regulated flammable substance in the largest vessel or pipe is released instantaneously and allowed to vaporize over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\n3.2 Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn addition to the worst-case scenario, this RMP contains a seco"

ABR Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis section describes the general accident prevention programs in place at ABR, which are required for all\n\nLevel 3 covered process units described in Section 2 and is applied throughout the facility.\n\n\n\nEmployees are responsible for implementing the prevention elements for his/her department as follows:\n\nSafety Department: Process Safety Information, Process Hazards Analyses, Compliance Audits, Employee\n\nParticipation, Contractor Orientation, Incident Investigation, Hot Work Procedure, Contractors, Emergency\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n* Training Department: Operating Procedures, Employee Training, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\n* Operations Department: Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Employee Participation\n\n* Production Services Department: Mechanical Integrity\n\n* Project Engineering: Process Safety Information, Management of Change\n\n* Department Manager: Incident Investigation\n\n\n\nAll records associated with the prevention elements and the Risk Management Program are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\n\n\n4.1 Process Safety Information\n\nABR maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of the process units. Process Safety Information (PSI), which addresses chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information, was compiled for each process unit.\n\n\n\nPSI is used in process unit hazard analysis, inspection, maintenance, and training activities.

Under this program, each process is systematically examined by a multidisciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards. ABR has used the hazard and operability study methodology as the refinery's primary process hazard analysis technique. Some of the revalidation was performed using the \"what if\" and risk matrix methodologies. Pertinent parameters, such as flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid level, were reviewed.\n\n\n\nABR updates and revalidates the hazard analyses every five years to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features.\n\n\n\nA seismic review of the refinery was conducted as part of the technical studies. The refinery is located in an area that is prone to earthquakes. A site walk through was conducted in 1996 by a qualified engineering company for Shell, the previous owner. The objective of the seismic assessments was to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substances having off-site consequences would not occur as a result of a major earthquake. The results and findings from the seismic review are documented and retained in the computerized tracking system.\n\n\n\n4.3 Operating Procedures\n\nABR has developed and implemented written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each process.
