At the Dudley, Massachusetts Facility, Shield blends ingredients to customer specifications, and packages the products in consumer quantity packages.  A Site Location Map is included in the RMP.  RMP regulations (40 CFR 68) and Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations \n\n(29 CFR 1910.119) are applicable to processes at the Facility including those processes associated with the filling of aerosol spray cans and warehousing of finished aerosol products that use flammable propellants at greater than threshold quantities.  The regulated propellants used at the Facility include propane, butane, isobutane, and dimethyl ether.  These propellants are used at the facility as liquefied compressed gases, and are stored in above ground bulk liquid storage tanks (Tank Farm) under pressure.  \n\n\n\nThe propellants regulated under the RMP and PSM programs are used in simple mixtures at the facility.  No chemical reactions are involved in the process.  As a result, the accidental release program for the facility is limited to operating procedures, maintenance of mechanical integrity of the process equipment, and management of change.  Release prevention in the Tank Farm is discussed in the RMP.  Shield has not had a reportable release of RMP regulated chemicals at the facility in the past 5 years.  In the event of an accidental release, Shield personnel are trained to perform emergency shut-down procedures to stop or control the release if it is safe to do so.  These procedures include emergency shutdown of the aerosol filling equipment and the propellant supply system.  The process hazard analysis identified steps to improve process safety, and categorized mechanical integrity issues as low, medium, or high priority.  High priority improvements will be performed before lower priority issues, and include the replacement of aged hoses and repair of some electrical equipment\n\n\n\nThe Facility consists o"

The Facility is engaged in the business of compounding, blending and packaging aerosol and liquid consumer products for personal care, household and automotive/industrial applications.  Compounding/blending and packaging are performed in the main plant, a building located on the eastern portion of the property.  Approximately 48 full-time employees work at the Facility.  Emergency contact information for this Facility is included herein.\n\n\n\nThe Facility includes twenty-six (28) fixed, aboveground tanks which are used to store chemical components used in the compounding and packaging processes.  During processing/packaging operations, material in the appropriate Facility tanks is transported by fixed piping to the process lines in the main plant.  The processes regulated under the Risk Management Plan and Process Safety Management programs include the storage of propellants, charging of aerosol cans with propellant, and storage of filled aerosol cans.  Propellant is stored in above ground storage tanks as liquefied gas under pressure.  Liquid propellant is drawn from the bottom of the bulk storage tanks using one of four transfer pumps and transferred to the aerosol filling system via aboveground piping.  The transfer pumps increase the pressure of the propellant from tank pressure to manifold pressure.  The manifold is equipped with pressure relief valves set at 450 psig.  \n\n\n\nPropellant is transported through piping to the \"gas rooms\" which contains the aerosol can charging system.  The system accepts cans containing the required amount of product.  The filling unit mechanically seals the top of the can and opens a valve connected to the propellant manifold.  Pressure from the transfer pump causes propellant to flow into the can.  This valve remains open for a pre-set period of time, which dictates how much propellant enters the can.

A small quantity of propellant is released with each fill from the annular space between the mechanical seal and the can.\n\n\n\nFollowing filling, cans exit the \"gas room\" and are conveyed to a hot water bath where the cans are submerged to check for seal integrity and overfilling.  According to Facility personnel, a small number of cans are expected to leak or rupture in this process.  Following the cans exit from the water bath, cans are labeled, capped as appropriate, crated and/or palletized, and stored pending off-site shipment.  A block flow diagram illustrating the Site processes is included in the RMP.\n\n\n\nAs discussed, the processes use compressed propane, butane, isobutane, and dimethyl ether as propellants for products packaged in aerosol spray cans.  The propellants are delivered to the Facility by tanker truck, off-loaded, and stored in four aboveground tanks located in the northeastern portion of the property adjacent to the railroad tracks.  The size and contents of the tanks are as follows:\n\n\n\n?    Tank 20 - 30,000 gallon -Dimethyl ether (DME)\n\n?    Tank 21 - 30,000 gallon - Butane/Propane blend (AB-70 Propellant)\n\n?

The propellants are stored liquefied under pressure in these tanks, and are transferred via pumps to the filling process lines in the main plant through fixed pipes.

The gas bunkers are monitored by an automated gas detection system (LIRA System) which automatically shuts down the process and propellant supply lines if propellant concentrations in air exceed certain limits In addition, the gas bunkers are equipped with a fire/blast detection and suppression system (Fenwal System, see additional information in Table 2 in the RMP).\n\n\n\nRMP regulated substances used at the facility include propane, butane, isobutane, and dimethyl ether.  Material Safety Data Sheets for each of these listed RMP regulated substances are included in the RMP.  \n\n\n\nAs discussed in the RMP, the worst case scenario for the Site is the failure and explosion of the 30,000-gallon storage tank containing AB-70 (mix of propane and butane) and approximately 90% full.  This would result in a release of approximately 65,800 lbs. of propane and approximately 52,800 lbs. of butane.
