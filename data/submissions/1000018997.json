This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training, design safety, operation and maintenance of the facility.\n\nThe Big Medicine Bow Production Facility is located in Carbon County, WY and is situated 10 miles South Southwest of Medicine Bow in Medicine Bow WY, The plant receives natural gas from well production. The natural gas is compressed and then cooled by a JT unit where the pressure is reduced. During plant operation, natural gas liquids are recovered. The natural gas liquids are comprised of ethane, propane, butane, and pentane. The natural gas liquids are stored in an 8,500 gallon tank. The natural gas liquids are delivered and sold via truck.\n\nProgram Level 1\nIt has been determined that the Big Medicine Bow Production Facility is a Program 1 facility. There are no public receptors within the radius of exposure of the worse case release scenario. In addition this facility does not qualify as an OSHA Process Safety Management facility under 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nRelease Scenario\nThe worst case release scenario assumes that the entire volume from the one 8,500 gallon tank is released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The worst-case analysis was based on the entire flammable mixture in the process at 90% capacity which is the maximum storage for this container under administrative controls.  The components of the mixture include: butane (14,640 lbs.),"

      "SummaryText": "ethane (834 lbs.), methane (70 lbs.), propane (5769 lbs.), and N pentane (15,611 lbs.) for a total storage weight of 36,932 lbs. RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 0.3 miles to the flammable endpoint was determined for a release of 36,932 lbs. for the process.\n\nAccident History\nThis facility has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWhiting takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facilities by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  The facility is a Program Level 1 facility and therefore does not have a specific emergency response program.  Whiting does although have a company-wide Emergency Response Plan, which includes emergency contact information for the area, that is implemented when needed and is designed to protect personnel, property, and the environment in event of an emergency as well as to provide notification, appropriate information and protection for response personnel.   \n\nConclusion\nWhiting understands that strong health, safety, and environmental principles, properly integrated into our management processes, and day to day practices, greatly contributes to our business success."
