Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nChiala Farms conducts inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment prior to startup and during operations. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. On-site personnel and certified refrigeration contractors review the equipment as required.\r\n\r\nOn-site personnel provide initial emergency response. On-site personnel will make a preliminary assessment in the event of a release and will provide first response. First response may include emergency equipment shutdown, system isolation, or controlled operation such as pump down to prevent or reduce an off-site release. No emergency operations will be performed that are beyond the capabilities of the operators or other on-site personnel. Local fire and police departments with mutual aid response will provide emergency response for a major release event. Refrigeration contractors would also be on-call to provide emergency response.\r\n\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required to for new employees. Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Chiala Farms facility acts as the stationary source for regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia which is used as a refrigerant in their produce freezing, freezer storage, cold storage, and chilled water generation operations. To see a location map and site plan of the stationary source, refer to sheet T0.0 in Appendix A.2.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was built in 2015 as part of the newly constructed Chiala Farms facility. The refrigeration system was constructed as per current applicable codes and industry standards. The facility has (4) refrigerated rooms (Raw Product, Packaging, Freezer, and Dock A"

The system's compressors and vessels are located in a dedicated Engine Room with refrigeration equipment both inside and immediately outside the room. The evaporative condensers are mounted above the Engine Room. Electrical services and controls are provided in the Engine and Electrical Rooms.\r\n\r\nThe refrigeration system is comprised of mechanical equipment including, but not limited to, evaporative condensers, screw compressors, pressure vessels, a water chiller, room cooling evaporator fan coils, tunnel freezers, refrigeration pumps, hand and control valves, ammonia detection and PLC controls systems, and a diffusion tank. A full list of refrigeration equipment used at this facility can be found in the schedules located in Appendix A.2. International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Ammonia Refrigeration Safety Inspection Checklists, located in Appendix A.1, provide comprehensive equipment details. Drawings R1.0 and R2.0 in Appendix A.2 show the refrigeration equipment layout.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a single-stage vapor compression cycle operating at two (2) suction pressures. In general, the process chemistry for this system is shown in Section V.A.2. The total refrigeration charge of approximately 25,000 lb is completely closed and pressurized within the system.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn. See Appendix A.4 for Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. General Acciden"

      "SummaryText": "tal Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nChiala Farms maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases. The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training. There is a program to analyze release occurrences and investigate ways to prevent a similar future release (see Appendix J-Incident Investigation).\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system has specific safety procedures to prevent a release. Chiala Farms operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system. They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release. The PLC controls system provides preliminary alarming if any processes are operating out of normal conditions; thus, enabling operators to return the system to normal without resorting to emergency actions. There are emergency shut-off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system. Ammonia detectors are installed in the Process and Engine Rooms. Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds its set point. Monitoring is done 24 hours per day. Pressure relief valves are installed on all pressure vessels and they are tied into an ammonia diffusion tank to prevent high-pressure releases to ambient. Before any of the aforementioned .\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Chiala Farms facility was a newly constructed facility at the submittal of this RMP; therefore, there is no accident history involving the release of anhydrous ammonia associated with the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nIn event of a release, certain personnel are designated to determine the potential hazard and coordinate response procedures. The Safety Manager is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, acute care facilities, and any other sensitive populations that may be affecte"

The Safety Manager will also be responsible for evacuation of employees if necessary and for coordination with community emergency responders if off-site evacuations are required. A detailed overview of the emergency response plan is included in Appendix N.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nRecommended corrective actions to mitigate the potential for an accidental ammonia release are proposed on the tables located in Section VIII. The table items are a result from recommendations made during the Process Hazard Analysis, a Code Compliance Review, and a Safety Inspection performed by KIE Consultants, qualified engineering consultants. Specific facility areas categorize recommendations resulting from the Safety Inspection. Based on the severity of the hazards identified, implementation deadlines are also recommended.\r\nAll refrigeration equipment shall be well maintained and operated in a safe manner by trained personnel. Operating, maintenance, training, and safety procedures will be formalized with improved written documentation."
