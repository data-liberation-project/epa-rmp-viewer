This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nWe have 6 regulated substances present at our facility. These substances include Pentane, Propane, Methane, Isobutane [Propane, 2-methyl], Ethane and Butane are by-products of the gas production process.\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA RMP*Comp model. Based on the criteria of 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specified endpoint for the worst-case scenario could impact operations at the Elk Hills 1-C Gas Plant facility.\nHowever, our facility does meet, and has fully implemented the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.119 as outlined in Section 4 below.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our facility has taken all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility. These elements are the basis for our Process Safety Management system as required under 29 CFR 1910.119.\nProcess Safety Information Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated w"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n   Operating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n   Training\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes as well as emergency response activities. Refresher training is provided every 3 years.\n   Mechanical Integrity\nOccidental of Elk Hills, Inc. carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, pumps, compressors and electrical equipment. Qualified personnel carry out maintenance operations with previous training in maintenance practices.\nFurthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are tracked to completion through the company maintenance work order system and corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n   Manage"
