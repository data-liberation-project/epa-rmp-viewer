The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst case scenario is a liquid spill and vaporization caused by a loss of the contents of two connected 29,800 gallon tanks containing 1% ClO2 solution.  This is a gas release of chlorine dioxide for 10 minutes.  The assumed weather conditions include a conservative temperature and relative humidity.  The estimated exposure distance is 4.19 miles.  Areas which could be affected by the release include Holston Valley and Indian Path Hospitals, the Kingsport Health Clinic, Andrew Jackson, George Washington, Gravely, Andrew Johnson, Jefferson, Cedar Grove, Brookside, Roosevelt, Carters Valley, John F. Kennedy, and Abraham Lincoln Elementary Schools, Lynn View, John Sevier, and Robinson Middle Schools, Dobyns Bennett and North High Schools, Gravely Apolistic Christian, St. Dominic's, and Cedar View Christian Schools, Christian Life Academy, and the Kingsport University Center.  Controls are in place to limit the offsite consequences of any release through pre-startup review, training, and onsite response personnel.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release of chlorine dioxide includes liquid spill of chlorine dioxide solution from a pipe leak and vaporization.  The pipe is 700 feet of 4\" pipe filled with 1% chlorine dioxide solution.  An estimated 38 pounds of ClO2 would be released under this scenerio.  The release could impact an area 1.21 miles from the event.  Areas which could be affected by this scenerio include Holston Valley Hospital, Andrew "

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\nActive employee participation and involvement are essential to the success of the RMP program.  The participation minimizes the consequences of releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Communication is encouraged between supervision and employees.  To promote safety, at a minimum, monthly departmental safety meetings are held.  In addition, to the meetings, a central safety committee with employee representation from all areas is held.  Five minute huddles are also used to communicate additional safety concerns.  Other forms of safety communication include near miss reporting, abnormal incident reports (AIR), and special training (emergency response, first aid, CPR, etc.)  Employees are always encouraged to speak to supervision about questions, suggestions, or comments concerning safety.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\nA variety of process safety information is available concerning process chemicals and their uses.  MSDSs are available through most networked computers and the main guard house computer.  A hard c"

The MSDSs are updated and any new chemical received into the mill must first undergo a new material check approval signed by the environmental, safety, process, and purchasing departments.  PSI notebooks containing pertainant operations, safety, and maintenance information is kept in various places throughout the mill.  SOPs supply additional information on safety when performing a task.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA)\nProcess hazard analysis (PHA) are performed on the PSM/RMP chemicals used in the mill.  Chlorine dioxide is the only on-site chemical that the PHA is performed on.  The PHA is performed for the chlorine dioxide system and is instrumental in determining potential safety items which can be corrected and known.  A what if and fault tree analysis is performed to identify failure modes.  Once a failure condition is known, the consequences of the failure is identified.\n\nThe PHAs are conducted by a team consisting of engineering, safety, environmental, maintenance, operations, and supervision.   The team identifies failures and their consequences.  The results are reviewed for the seriousness of the hazards and the most severe are performed first.  \n\nThe reviews are updated at a minimum of every 5 years.  The updates are documented and reviewed for the recommendations and appropriate measures are taken.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\nThe Kingsport Mill has standard operating procedures (SOPs) which address the general purpose, operating equipment, objectives, safety considerations, normal operating parameters, troubleshooting and reference drawings for the process.  \n\nThe purpose of the SOPs are to understand the correct procedures for a job or task.  SOPs are reviewed by operations and supervision for accuracy and understanding.  Special safety considerations are also presented in the SOPs.\n\nTRAINING\nAll new employees are required to have a general mill safety training before their specific area safety training.  All safe"

Procedural training, on-the-job training, and testing on safety and process ability is also a mandatory part of the training program.  Employees are also encouraged to participate in computerized training programs available at the mill.\n\nPRE-STARTUP SAFETY REVIEW\nWhenever process safety information is modified or added, a pre-startup safety review is conducted to ensure the safety of the modification or addition.  The PSSR involves field verification of amended area and verification of the accident prevention program.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\nThe maintenance department has well established procedures for maintaining process equipment.  Training, inspections and a tracking system to detect deficiencies is in place.  Whenever maintenance personnel  are required to work on PSM equipment, an overview of the process and the safety and health hazards are discussed with the personnel along with applicable safe work practices. \n\nAnother part of the integrity program is the quality assurance of the material used in the repairs.  Unique PSM equipment is set up in a separate area of the storeroom and is used exclusively for the chlorine dioxide system.\n\nSAFE WORK PRACTICES\nSafe work practices are encouraged and required at the Kingsport Mill. Several safe work practice plans are enforced including lockout/tagout, control of entry and exit, hot work permits, fall protection, and confined space programs.  These procedures and training programs help ensure good safe work practices.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\nThe Kingsport Mill has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all PSM/RMP processes.  The management of change requires that changes to items such process equipment, procedures and other changes be reviewed and documented (by participants signature) before initiation of the change.

The intent of the investigations are to correct the situation or install additional safety factors so that the incident will not reoccur. The outcome of the investigations are forwarded to specific individuals or departments for corrective actions to begin as soon as possible.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nCompliance audits are performed at least every 3 years.  The findings are documented and resolutions for the findings are done.  The findings are tracked for completeness until each items has been addressed.  An additional internal chlorine dioxide plant audit is performed by mill personnel from the Kingsport mill and other Willamette mills.  This additional audit was performed in 1998 in addition to the 1996 PSM audit.  Bi-annual safety audits are done by safety professionals from other Willamette facilities.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.   \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThe Kingsport mill has had only one accident in the last 5 years.   The accident was the result of lost water flow to the scrubber condensor, which caused increased emissions of chlorine dioxide.  The release did not go off site; however, "
