The North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substance but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.0\tDescription of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility's Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant is located within the city limits of North Little Rock, Arkansas.  The facility is part of the North Little Rock Waste Water Utility wastewater collection and treatment system.  The Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\r\n\r\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for the disinfection of the wastewater prior to releasing to the receiving stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0\tHazard Assessment\r\n\r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule requires the Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the chlorine stored and used in the chlorination process at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Hazard Assessment results have been appropriately communi"

A compliance audit report is prepared after each audit, and any deficiencies noted by the audit are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n4.7\tIncident Investigations\r\n\r\nThe Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant will investigate all incidents that could reasonably result in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment.  The Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant is developing an incident investigation program which encourages employees to identify and report any and all incidents requiring investigation.  An investigation team will be assembled, and the investigation will be initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate process enhancements implemented.\r\n\r\n4.8\tChemical-specific Prevention Steps - Chlorine\r\n\r\nIndustry standards are followed at The Faulkner Lake Treatment Plant to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.
