Planned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\nAll recommendations from PHAs, MOCs, PSSRs, mechanical integrity inspections, incident investigations, and compliance audits are addressed on an on-going basis.  It is also Aspire Bakeries policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable and effective.  This continuous review process generates further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations and these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame. \r\n\r\n9.  Summary\r\n\r\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia systems according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner.  The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs.  Aspire Bakeries has developed an Emergency Response Plan which is coordinated through the local response agencies and has communicated the information in this Risk Management Plan to the local community.  Aspire Bakeries corporate and plant management are committed to safety and implementation of safe procedures and practices for both Prevention and Preparedness."

      "SummaryText": "nt are being addressed.  All findings from earlier audits have been addressed.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - Aspire Bakeries routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the Hazleton Plant.  An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of an incident and to help them develop measures to prevent recurrence. \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has been conducted for all affected employees.  Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures is an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs. \r\n\r\nHot Work Permit Program - A hot work permit program is being used at the Hazleton Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia systems. \r\n\r\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures are in place and include reviews of contractor performance and the inclusion of safety performance and programs in selecting contractors for work on or adjacent to the ammonia process.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been no release of ammonia from the Hazleton Plant in the last five years that meets the RMP reporting criteria. \r\n\r\n\r\n7.  Emergency Response Preparedness Program\r\n\r\nThe Hazleton Plant has an emergency response preparedness program which is described in the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP).  This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur.  The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic exposures to ammonia.  The facility has an on-site trained hazardous material (hazmat) team for responding to ammonia releases, isolate, and minimize off-site consequences.  The ERP is coordinated with the Hazle Township Fire Department and"

Recommendations made by the most recent PHA team to improve the safety of the systems are being addressed to further reduce the risk of an accidental release or incident.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures - An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the ammonia system and for safe work practices.  Safe work practices include the use of ammonia personal protective equipment, lockout/tagout procedures, confined space entry procedures, safe use of motorized vehicles around ammonia equipment, and access control to critical areas.  Operating procedures are reviewed and re-certified annually to make sure they are current.\r\n\r\nTraining - Training is provided to each ammonia system operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the systems.  There is a company developed ammonia operator training and certification program and includes initial and refresher training.\r\n\r\nMaintenance - All of the covered ammonia equipment is included in the Hazleton preventive maintenance program.  Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Bulletin 109 and a company developed mechanical integrity program.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure is followed for all changes made to the ammonia systems, including the safety systems, to ensure that the system safety and integrity are not compromised.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review (PSR) - Pre-startup reviews are conducted whenever a change results in a change to the PSI.  Checklists are used to direct the PSSR process.  The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup of new or modified systems. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits - Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.

The system consists of vessels, compressors, evaporators, icemakers,condensers, safety relief systems, ammonia detectors and alarms.  All leaks are addressed and the system charge is maintained at intended levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Release Scenario Analysis\r\n\r\nRelease scenarios were analyzed using the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration, the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.  A worst-case release scenario was defined to determine the potential emergency response procedures needed for the facility and community; however, it is important to empha that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant.  On the other hand, the alternative release scenarios are based on credible assumptions. \r\n\r\n\r\n5.  Prevention Programs\r\n\r\nFor the Hazleton Plant ammonia system, Aspire Bakeries followed the ANSI/IIAR 2 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur.  Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the ammonia system.  The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment design and the technology of the process.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA) - A Revalidation PHA of the second ammonia refrigeration system was conducted to satisfy the PSM requirements in 2017.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nIt is Aspire Bakeries policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  The Hazleton Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual that documents safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response preparedness.  In addition to the PSM Manual, the Hazleton Plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source Activities\r\n\r\nThe Hazleton Plant is located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  The plant produces par-baked goods and frozen dough.  The products are frozen, packaged and stored in a frozen goods warehouse prior to shipment.  Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for freezing/cooling and for frozen finished goods storage. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration systems at the Hazleton Plant are a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule.  The ammonia systems are a closed loop which recirculates and reuses the same material.  Infrequent makeup to the s"
