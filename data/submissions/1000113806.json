Given the quantity handled, anhydrous ammonia is\t\t\t\nconsidered a hazardous substance by the EPA.\t\t\t\nMany of the properties that make ammonia valuable as a refrigerant also require precautions\t\t\t\nand procedures be in place to protect employee and public health and safety during a chemical\t\t\t\nemergency. It is the policy of Diamond Fruit to be in compliance with all applicable federal and state\t\t\t\nrules and regulations.\t\t\t\nSafety at our facility is inherent on the manner in which anhydrous ammonia is handled. While the\t\t\t\ndesign of the facility incorporates many safety devices, and safe handling procedures combined with\t\t\t\nappropriate training of our personnel are key aspects to maintaining safety at our facility.\t\t\t\nWe have a written Process Safety Management (PSM) plan that complies with the regulations\t\t\t\nstipulated by OAR 1910.119. A crucial component of this plan is the Emergency Response Plan,\t\t\t\ndeveloped in compliance with the Emergency Response provisions of OAR 1910.120. The\t\t\t\nEmergency Response Plan includes pre-emergency planning and coordinating with outside parties.\t\t\t\nThis enables those who deal with emergencies to have a course of action to effectively deal with\t\t\t\nunplanned events.\t\t\t\n1.20 Facility Description And Substances Handled\t\t\t\n-Diamond Fruit stores and packs fruit, such as pears, cherries, and apples. Production requires\t\t\t\nthe use of a refrigeration system to preserve the integrity of our fruit. This refrigeration process uses\t\t\t\nammonia as a refrigerant. Access to the facility is restricted to authorized employees, management\t\t\t\npersonnel, and contractors.\t\t\t\n-The regulated substance handled at this facility is anhydrous ammonia.\t\t\t\n-The ammonia refrigeration system's maximum inventory is 25,500 pounds of anhydr"
