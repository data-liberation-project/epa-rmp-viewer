      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical Distribution and Warehousing Facilities\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Bayer, Polyurethane Division are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the storage and distribution processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with local Fire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass closed container Distribution of chemicals that serves the plastics, polyurethane, dyes and pigments industries.  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance, unspecified monomer of toluene diisocyanate, is used as a reactant in the manufacturing of flexible polyurethane foams and other elastomers.   The maximum inventory of  toluene diisocyanate at our facility is 625,400lb.  This inventory is  located in tow separate processes.  A bulk storage tank inventories 305,300 lbs, while a warehouse storage area for drummed material inventories 320,000 lbs of toluene diisocyanate.\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Equations and Tables.  The following paragraphs provide de"

      "SummaryText": "tails of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 1 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the bulk storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 305400lb. of toluene diisocyanate in a liquid form, which evaporates at a rate of 0.02 lbs./min in excess of 60 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes and sumps are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.01 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the warehouse process involves the release of a drum of toluene diisocyanate onto the loading dock area of the warehouse.  The release of 550 pounds of material in liquid form evaporates at a rate of 0.002 lbs./min.  At this evaporation rate, the spilled release exceeds 60 minutes duration.  Passive mitigation controls are not taken into account for this scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the toxic endpoint of 0.0070 mg/L extends to 0.06 miles.\n\nNo alternative release scenario will be submitted for this toxic substance as none is required for Program 1 processes.\n\nThere are no regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity at this stationary source; thus a worst case release scenario for flammable substances as a class is not submitted.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under California State Accidental Release Program, which mimics 29 OSHA 1910.119.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels Section VIII, 1968 Edition and the American National Standards Institute Code B31.3.

All materials are stored in containers that meet or exceed the Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements.   The closed containers are stored in accordance with the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) codes.  Containers holding material are inspected for integrity when pulling the order for shipment and during the process of loading.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nBayer, Polyurethane Division maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP and What-If/Checklists.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes, Bayer, Polyurethane maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nBayer, Polyurethane Division has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating pro"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance activities are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Bayer, Polyurethane Division to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Bayer, Polyurethane Division.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nBayer, Polyurethane Division conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the CalARP rule are being implemented.
