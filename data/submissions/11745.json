The corporate environmental compliance manager has been \nassigned overall responsibility for chemical safety in general and \nfor ammonia refrigeration safety in particular since 1991. \nSchwan's maintains 3 - shift coverage of emergency responders \ntrained to the 24-hour technician level at all facilities with \nammonia refrigeration systems covered by this rule.\n\nThe Norwood Young America, MN facility manufactures frozen food \nproducts. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration system at \nthis facility. Ammonia is the most efficient and environmentally \ncompatible refrigerant available. Although it is toxic at high \nconcentration and is an irritating gas, it is not a cumulative \nmetabolic poison, does not cause cancer or other dread diseases \nand does not cause lasting environmental damage. The refrigeration \nsystem at this facility contains about 27,300 pounds of ammonia. \nThe refrigeration system was installed in 1994 and is a nearly \nnew state of the art, system.\n\nSchwan's calculates ammonia worst case release scenarios using the \nModel RMP for Ammonia Refrigeration, May 1996. All Schwan's \nmanufacturing facilities are located in areas that meet the \ndefinition of \"urban\". Schwan's has chosen to calculate worst case \nrelease poundage for the largest high-pressure receiver in the \nsystem, filled to full calculated hydraulic capacity. Reduced \nvolume for administrative controls was not used, since the \ndescribed scenario would probably occur only as a result of a \ncatastrophic vessel rupture caused by a total filling of the \nvessel, closure of all vessel block valves, failure of all \npressure relief valves, with a simultaneous increase in liquid \ntemperature sufficient to overpressure the vessel to the point of \nfailure.\n\nIt is the professional judgement of Schwans Environmental Health \nand Safety Department that a release rate of 400 lb./min. should \nbe used as an alternate case scenario in "

The alternate case will be a \nrelease rate of 400 pounds per minute. Both scenarios have off-\nsite impacts.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is covered by the OSHA Process \nSafety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe Norwood Young America, MN facility maintains a 3-shift \nemergency response team, trained at the 24-hour technician level. \nThe team numbers 8 members. The training is conducted by the \nCorporate Environmental Compliance Manager. The training is \ndesigned with a heavy emphasis on ammonia safety, mechanical \nisolation, personal protective equipment up to use of Level `A' \nsuits and interaction with an incident command system (ICS). \nCopies of emergency plans are filed with the Fire Department and \nannual facility walkthroughs are conducted with Fire Officers. \nPreplanned command posts and staging areas have been designated \nand Incident Command transfer and liaison functions have been \nestablished. A post-incident debriefing will be conducted after \neach incident.\n\nSince a continuous improvement philosophy is deeply imbedded in \nthe Schwan's corporate culture, improvements in system safety are \nimplemented as a result of employee-based involvement, a \ndesignated PSM team and as a result of system engineering \nmodifications and extensions. Post incident debriefings and \nincident investigations will be used to identify additional \nimprovements to system safety."
