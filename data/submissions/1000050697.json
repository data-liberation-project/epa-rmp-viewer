[68.155(a)]\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 The stationary source and regulated substances handled? [68.155(b)]\n\n\n\nHydrogen is the regulated substance that is managed at the Airgas USA, LLC fill plant in Tulsa, OK.  Liquefied hydrogen is delivered to this location via bulk transport vehicle and is placed inside a bulk storage tank. The liquefied hydrogen is vaporized and compressed into compressed gas cylinders and compressed gas tube (cylinder) trailers, both of which are manufactured to DOT specifications.  The Airgas USA, LLC fill plant distributes the full hydrogen cylinders and tube trailers to Airgas distribution centers and retail stores, and to customers.\n\n\n\n2.5.3 The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps? [68.155(c)]\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.  Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing accidental release prevention processes that are specific to hydrogen and that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 The five-year accident history? [68.155(d)]\n\n\n\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered process had not been involved with an accidental release that could have lead to propert"

In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or restoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 222 for additional information or if applicable, updated information.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 The emergency response program? [68.155(e)]\n\n\n\nEmployees of the stationary source will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.  The stationary source has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with local emergency responders.  Refer to Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual Appendix Tab 2280 and Appendix Tab 3120 for additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Planned changes to improve safety? [68.155(f)]\n\n\n\nImplementation of the RMP processes produced many changes that improved safety.  Revalidation of the PHA, which took place February 25, 2013, produced several additional changes to improve safety including verification of safety systems and procedures and implementation of new safety systems and procedures. Please refer to the PSM/RMP Corrective Action/Improvement Log for additional information. \n\n"
