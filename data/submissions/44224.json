      "SummaryText": "Shawnee Milling Company operates rural feed stores offering anhydrous ammonia to local farmers.  Onsite\nstorage and dispensing of this toxic chemical varies in quantities based on seasonal application demand.  For\napproximately 3-4 months of the year, maximum quantities of anhydrous ammonia are reduced to less than 20%\n(14,000 pounds) of the maximum 70,260 pounds held in storage.\n\nThe company ensures that tanks and components are regularly maintained by qualified contractors.  The facility\nis regularly inspected by both employees, it's insurance carrier, and the state of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis facility would have a maximum of 70,260 pounds of anhydrous ammonia onsite at its peak sales periods.\nAdministrative operating procedures limit the storage tank to 85% of its capacity.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is structural damage to the bulk storage tank containing, at peak operating periods, up \nto 70,260 pounds of NH3.  Failure would result in a near-full release of ammonia within 10 minutes in a rural\nenvironment.  The toxic endpoint has been calculated to 4.7 miles from the tank at which point it would be \ndispersed enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  Public receptors include residences, schools and\nrecreation areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the distance to endpoint.\n\nThe more probable alternative accidental release would involve overfilling a tank with a maximum potential\nrelease of up to 100 pounds.  Quantities of 3-10 pounds are more likely.  In this alternative worst-case\nscenario, the toxic endpoint would be limited to under 0.2 miles which would expose less than 100 people\nand no other commercial or public receptors.\n\nThis facility has not had a reportable accidental release in the last five years.  Employees are trained in the safe\nhandling, storage and dispensing of anhydrous ammonia by the State of Oklahoma Department of Agriculture.\n\nThis facility follows the emergency response plan established by the Grady Co"
