The Area 2 and Area 3 systems are not mentioned in this RMP.\n\n\n\nThe facility also uses another regulated substance, sulfur dioxide; however, the maximum amount of sulfur dioxide on site at any time is 4,000 pounds, which is below the EPA RMP threshold, and therefore not mentioned in this RMP.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is regulated for sulfur dioxide and ammonia under the local CalARP regulations and complies with all local regulations, as required.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nSenior management at the facility is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all employees and the surrounding communities.  Senior management administers the safety and environmental policies and programs.  These programs include but are not limited to forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturers' documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe Wine Group, Inc. facility has independently coordinated emergency response efforts with the local Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of The Wine Group, Inc. to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department/HazMat team to respond to the emergency.
