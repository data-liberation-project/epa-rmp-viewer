(XTO) has a strong commitment to the protection of workers and the environment.    \n\nThe Coyote Station site has an active safety program covering both    \n\nemployees and contract workers. This program encompasses promotion of safe work practices to    \n\nprevent personal accidents, and incidents that would adversely affect the community. XTO    \n\nrecognizes their commitment to accident prevention through continuing programs including    \n\npersonnel training. Consideration is also given to safety in the design, installation, and operation of    \n\nnatural gas production and gathering systems and modifications to the Site. The safety commitment    \n\nis also carried forth as evidenced by an aggressive maintenance program. Reasonable controls    \n\nhave been implemented to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely    \n\nevent that a release does occur, arrangements have been made within the local community to    \n\nprovide response and control of any catastrophic releases. Passive mitigation, such as vents, is    \n\npresent at the site to manage any overpressure conditions that may occur.\n\n    \n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\n    \n\nThe facility is located off FM 1776 with the closet town being Coyanosa located in Pecos    \n\nCounty Texas. Inherent with the operation of an oil and gathering and stabilization process, the    \n\nprocess stores regulated flammable substances above the threshold quantity. These flammable    \n\nsubstances are addressed throughout the RMP, and may include ethane, propane, butane,    \n\nisoButane, Pentane, and isopentane, which are all components of the Natural Gas Liquids Product    \n\n(NGLP).    \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n    \n\nXTO maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the    \n\nSite's processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, lim"

The Site ensures that each    \n\nprocess is maintained within approved limits using process controls and monitoring instruments,    \n\ntrained personnel, and automated shutdown systems.\n\n    \n\nThe Site also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and    \n\nconstruction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design    \n\npressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in    \n\ncombination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing    \n\ninspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and Site changes    \n\nto ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.    \n\nOperations at the Site have hazards that are managed to ensure continued safe operation.
