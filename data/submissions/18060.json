If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local fire department and request they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled.\n     This facility is a wholesale farm supply distribution center and liquefied petroleum gas dealer.  We do not sell propane to any customers, we use the propane for our own use.  Our storage consists of one 12,000 gallon storage tank and associated appurtenances. \n\nThe worst case scenario.\n     Our worst case scenario is the loss of the entire contents of the tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.   According to DEGRADIS modeling, the distance to the endpoint is 0.40 miles.  Due to the location of our storage tank, the worst-case scenario would affect population, public receptors and environmental receptors.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical -specific prevention steps.\n     This facility complies with all applicable federal, State and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFive-year accident history.\n     We have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage or evacuations.\n\nThe emergency response program.\n     In the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the emergency.  In preparation for this, we have coordinated with all of the local response agencies by providing information and facility tours to ensure that they are familiar with and properly prepared for an incident at our facility.
