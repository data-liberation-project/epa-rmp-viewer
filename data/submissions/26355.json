Are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia by utilization of proper equipment, regular inspections and maintenance and training of all persons that work with the material.  Should an accidental release occur, the facility has oriented the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale for farmers.  Anhydrous is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 196,000 lbs in a single large storage tank.\n\n3.  The Worse Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 lbs which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards and company procedures.  This distance to endpoint is 1.16 miles.\n\nThe alternative worst case scenario is assumed to be a release from the rupture of a transfer hose with 12000 lbs released over 2 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is .56 miles.\n\n4.  The Accidental Release Program:  The facility complies with the rules related to the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia and low pressure nitrogen solutions.  These regulations are administered by the Illinois Dept of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI K61.1 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\n\n5.  5 Year Accident History.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the processes covered by this RMP.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program:  The facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38 and provides state and local authoritie"

Our emergency plan is updated as needed and has been reviewed by the local fire department for coordination of emergency response planning.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to the Facility:  Safety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
