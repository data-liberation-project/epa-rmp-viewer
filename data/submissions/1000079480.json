      "SummaryText": "with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the accumulator. Each accumulator feeds two bunker mounted or ceiling suspended evaporator coils located in the Precool and Cold Storage Rooms. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it travels back to the accumulators, through a suction return line, and into the main suction accumulator. Any remaining liquid falls to the bottom of the vessel and is fed by gravity into the transfer vessel. Operation of a three-way solenoid valve causes the refrigerant to increase in pressure so that it can be returned to the high pressure receiver as high pressure liquid. From the main suction accumulator, the remaining low pressure vapor is piped to the suction inlet on the reciprocating compressors.\n\n \n\nThe compressors compress the low pressure vapor, and it exits through the discharge outlet as a high pressure and high temperature vapor. The vapor is then sent to evaporative condensers where it is cooled and liquefied. Each condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. The receiver serves as a holding tank for the liquid refrigerant being fed to the low side, and holds the bulk of the refrigerant in the system when it is not operating. \n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nThere are two ammonia detectors installed inside the refrigeration machi"

The second sensor is set at 10,000 ppm, which will shut down all refrigeration machinery and initiate an auto-dialer. Furthermore, each refrigerated room is equipped with a sampling tube, which is connected to a standalone ammonia detector inside the electrical room. This sampling detector is set at the California OSHA permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm, which will activate an audible alarm/strobe and initiate an auto-dialer.\n\n\n\nThe emergency control box was installed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2 and the Fire Code at the time of construction. The control box contains three (3) valves.\n\n\n\nValve #1: High Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #3: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening Valve #1 will evacuate the process through the high pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #2 will evacuate the process through the low pressure side of the system. Opening Valve #3 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system. The emergency control box is seldom used in a refrigeration system, but has been installed for rare emergency situations. \n\n\n\nEach reciprocating compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment. All ASME vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves. The high side of each system relieves at 250 psig while the low side of each system relieves at 150 psig. All pressure relief valves vent to the atmosphere. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressor.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Kirschenman Enterprises Lamont consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping.

During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nKirschenman Lamont has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Kirschenman Lamont facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use.

Nevertheless, Kirschenman Lamont continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.

In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Kirschenman Lamont's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\nKirschenman Lamont has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Kirschenman Lamont has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Kirschenman Lamont now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
