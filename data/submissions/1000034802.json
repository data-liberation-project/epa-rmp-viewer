Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we store liquefied hydrogen, and transfer it, as a gas, to tube trailers and hydrogen fuel delivery truck.  Hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility, and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's Emergency Action Plan regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and hazardous materials unit, if\n\napplicable, so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental\n\nreleases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR,\n\nPart 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios\n\ndescribed were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substance handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage of hydrogen and the transfer of same into tube trailers and high pressure hydrogen fueling trailer. The hydrogen is used by Air Products' customers for a variety of applications such as a fuel for vehicles, metal processing and cellular antenna towers. The hydrogen is delivered into the hydrogen storage tank as a cryogenic liquid. By means of a liquid compressor, the liquid hydrogen is pumped through 2 high pressure ambie"

Tube trailers are filled individually with hydrogen at one of four low pressure tube trailer stanchions.  The hydrogen fueling trailer is filled at one High pressure hydrogen filling stanchion. There is no chemical reaction involved. The process is strictly the transfer of hydrogen from a large storage container into trailers.\n\n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of hydrogen in the past five years, that resulted\n\nin any deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site or known off site deaths, injuries, evacuations,\n\nsheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's Emergency Planning standard. Employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA's First Responder Awareness Level under 1910.120. The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have been coordinated with the Rohrerstown Fire Department and the Lancaster County Emergency Management Agency for incidents related to the hydrogen process. Periodic drills will be conducted with this agency to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures.  In addition, site personnel are trained to deal with small cryogenic liquid spills.\n\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety"
