The regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. \n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system - in either design or operation. In addition the Main Plant Systems are separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nMonarch Nut Company's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual.

Monarch Nut Company has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) making up the CalARP program to document policies and address the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nFederal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.\n\nState regulations require reporting when there is an accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia.  Monarch Nut Company interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms.  All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded.  All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\nSmall releases which do not pose a threat will be considered incidental and do not require an emergency response such as a packing leak. The leak will be repaired and an incident repo"

Responders will investigate the release and report to General, Safety and Maintenance Management the location, extent of possible impact, level of risk and recommended actions.\n\nReleases less than 25 PPM shall result in immediately calling the General Manager, Safety Manager and the Maintenance Manager, if not on site, for instructions. Responders will investigate the release and report to General, Safety and Maintenance Management the location, extent of possible impact, level of risk and recommended actions.\n\nThe facility utilizes inspection procedures to review refrigeration equipment on an ongoing basis and prior to seasonal startup. These procedures identify potential sources of release and equipment corrections required to prevent these releases. Onsite personnel, registered engineers, refrigeration experts, and certified refrigeration contractors as required review the equipment.\n\nThere are full time Managers and operational employees at this facility in addition to the Maintenance Department that have been trained to conduct visual and audible inspections of the ammonia systems on a regular basis. They are instructed to report any condition that could result in an ammonia release immediately.  An example would be excessive rust on piping or tanks. \n\nThis team activity is the core of Monarch Nut Company's prevention program.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Monarch Nut Company facility provides product processing, packaging, cooling, and short-term storage for nuts and fruit.
