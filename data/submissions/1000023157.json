The CCRWWTF is located eight miles northwest of Cedar City in Iron County, Utah.  The North American Industrial Classification System code for the wastewater treatment facilities is 221320, Sewage Treatment Facilities.  CCRWWTF operates in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and health and safety regulations and is committed to maintaining compliance with these regulations.  The CCRWWTF has implemented an Emergency Action Plan at the facility in coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\nThe plant treats approximately 2.4 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) with a capacity of 4.4 mgd. The plant uses chlorine as secondary treatment to disinfect wastewater. Effluent from the plant is land applied to a 2,400 acre site located next to the treatment facility. Because effluent from the plant is land applied, the system does not require a dechlorination process. The amount of chlorine used in the chlorination processes exceed the threshold quantities (TQ) as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protections Agency's Risk Management Programs (RMP) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations. PSM regulations define the TQ for chlorine as 1,500 pounds, and RMP regulations define the TQ for chlorine 2,500 pounds.\n\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require proactive identification, evaluation and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur because of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  The RMP/PSM regulations define the responsibilities of employers and contractors involved in work that affects or takes place near processes covered by the regulations to ensure the safety of both plant and contractor employees and the potential effects on public and environmental receptors (RMP onl"

      "SummaryText": "y).  This RMP/PSM program describes the procedures, training, engineering controls and emergency response procedures implemented by CCRWWTF to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous chemicals from its covered processes. \n\nIt is the policy of CCRWWTF that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of chlorine into the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, CCRWWTF has performed the following tasks:\n\nA?    Gathered safety information on the process, equipment and procedures involving chlorine; \nA?    Performed a structured process hazard analysis (PHA) and evaluated external events that might affect the process; \nA?    Performed an off-site consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; \nA?    Established a written program for prevention and mitigation of accidental releases; and \nA?    Established a written emergency action plan coordinated with emergency response agencies.\n\nAn integral part of the RMP/PSM program is the completion of a PHA of the facility's storage and use of chlorine. The PHA was conducted using a WHAT IF? study.  An independent consultant directed a team composed of CCRWWTF personnel with detailed knowledge of the process, through the WHAT IF? study.  The objective of the study was to identify potential hazard scenarios, causes for these hazards, potential consequences associated with these scenarios and appropriate responses or actions to mitigate the identified hazards.  The team used a relative risk ranking based on the probability and severity of the hazards to assign a hazard category to each identified deviation.  The PHA study team evaluated these scenarios and discussed their possible consequences.  For each consequence, the team presented and/or developed a mitigating action to address such occurrences.\n\nAll of the improveme"

Any other measures identified by employees, during workplace hazard surveys or because of audit activities, will be thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation.\n\nAt the time of this report, CCRWWTF has updated their program to comply with the RMP/PSM requirements.  CCRWWTF is committed to reviewing and updating the program periodically, as appropriate, and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.  This RMP/PSM plan complies with all applicable regulations, and is accessible to all interested employees and contractors, at all times.  CCRWWTF has been proactive in developing and implementing the RMP/PSM for the treatment plant, not only to comply with state and federal requirements, but also as a commitment to workplace and public safety as a top priority. \n"
