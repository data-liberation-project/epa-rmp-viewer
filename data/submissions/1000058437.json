The company has been family owned for over 50 years.  Safety programs are dynamic and on a continuous improvement basis. Plant safety inspections and meetings are conducted monthly in conjunction with associates from various departments and a representative from its insurance carrier. The results of the inspection and meetings along with corrective actions and time frame are documented and available to all associates.  \r\n\r\nClosed loop refrigerated systems are utilized for the freezing and storage of the raw materials and finished products throughout the facility. The primary closed loop refrigerated systems in Lebanon utilize Anhydrous Ammonia as the refrigerant.  Anhydrous ammonia is classified as an extremely hazardous substance by the United States Department of Environmental Protection Agency, referred to as the EPA.\r\n\r\nEPA has determined that any facility that has a refrigerated system containing and utilizing Anhydrous Ammonia in excess of 10,000 lbs  (threshold) must have a plan clearly demonstrating procedures to be followed in the event of release of ammonia in excess of 100 lbs from the system into the environment.  This plan is referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP). The RMP is required to meet specific criteria demonstrating that measures are in place at the facility for minimizing the impact upon the environment, employees and the community when an event occurs.  This plan must be submitted to the EPA and be on file with them. Murrys has such a plan and has implemented the plan in both test and actual emergency conditions.  The Senior Vice President of Murrys in Lebanon is a permanent member of the Board of Directors for the Lebanon County Emergency Management Agency.  \r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia, when exposed to the environment will change fro"

Since the refrigerated systems are a closed loop, this transition from liquid to gas is only possible if there be a loss of integrity (failure or release) in the system.  The failure or release is of high concern to EPA and the operating facility and is the primary reason for the development of the RMP. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA) also requires facilities, which contain refrigerated systems with Anhydrous Ammonia, to have a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM). This program is also dictated by the quantity stored or used in process threshold levels for extremely hazardous substances.  All of the release prevention methods that are in place to protect the employee and satisfy the PSM standard also meet and comply with the applicable portions of the RMP."
