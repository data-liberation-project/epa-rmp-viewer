Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe EPA has adopted a policy for non-responding facilities (another entity has agreed in advance to respond to the release).  This facility is a non-responding facility.  The City Fire Department is a first responder.\n\nThis emergency response program does not include responses to incidential releases of hazardous substances, including chlorine, where the substance can be \"absorbed, neutrilized, or otherwise controlled at the time of the release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel\".\n\nThe City has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, and maintenance crews to be knowledgeable in the emergency response program.
