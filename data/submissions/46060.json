Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Bayer had sales of $10.1 billion in 2000 and is one of Fortune magazine's Most Admired Companies. The company employs 23,200 people. Bayer is investing $9 billion in capital expenditures and research and development from 2000 through the year 2004. 2000 capital investment and R&D expenditures were projected to total $1.6 billion. It is a member of the worldwide Bayer Group, a $29 billion international health care, polymers and chemicals group based in Leverkusen, Germany. The Bayer Group (BAYG.DE) stock is a component of the DAX, and is listed on multiple foreign exchanges.\n\nIn April 2000, Bayer acquired the global Polyols Business of Lyondell Chemical Company, including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, WV. Bayer did not purchase the assets at the Lyondell North Charleston Distribution Terminal.  In 1998, Lyondell Chemical Company acquired the assets of ARCO Chemical Company (ACC), including the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia.  In 1989, ARCO Chemical Company purchased the Polyols Manufacturing facilities from Union Carbide Corporation, which included the facilities in South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia.  In December 1999, Aventis was launched through the merger of  Hoechst AG and Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc S.A.  In 2003 Bayer purchased the Aventis facilities. In 2001, Dow purchased Union Carbide Corporation.

Also included in this acquisition were urethanes research and development facilities located within the Dow (formerly Union Carbide) South Charleston Technical Center.  \n\nIn South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia, Bayer directly employs about 110 people and provides employment for about 120 people under contract from Dow (formerly Union Carbide) and Bayer Crop Science (formerly Aventis). \n\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nBayer produces Polyols products that form the basis for polyurethanes, coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers of all kinds.  Products made from these materials fill the supermarket shelves and go into automobiles, housing, clothing and other necessities that improve the quality of life by making products safer, healthier and more convenient.\n\nThe products made at our South Charleston and Institute, West Virginia facilities belong to a family of chemicals called polyether polyols, and are derived from a chemical called propylene oxide, which is supplied by a Lyondell plant on the Gulf Coast.  Polyols are used primarily in polyurethane foams for products ranging from bedding and furniture, to automotive applications such as seat cushions and energy absorbing instrument panels and side panels.  Nearly two-thirds of all the auto seats in the U.S. today are made using the Bayer polyols products from the Kanawha Valley. Other polyols products we make here are used by our customers for applications as diverse as roof coatings, varnishes, roller blade wheels, and bowling balls.  All of the products are shipped to customers in other states or are exported to Europe, Asia, and South America.\n\nAnother product from our West Virginia facilities is technology. The scientists and technicians at our South Charleston Technical Center work closely together with our manufacturing organization here to develop new or improved polyols products and process technologies. These new technologies can then be used"

The American Chemistry Council (ACC) was formerly called the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA).  Since 1990, emissions of hazardous chemicals to the air from the Bayer South Charleston and Institute West Virginia facilities have been reduced by over 90% through improving processes and eliminating inefficient operations.  We have also made continuous improvements in our safety performance every year and rank among the industry leaders in this important aspect.  It is a policy of Bayer to establish goals for continuous improvement in the areas of health, safety, and the environment based on sound science, risk assessment and benefit analysis, against which we will measure, audit and communicate our performance.\n\nAnother initiative for continuous improvement is called Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence was formerly called Manufacturing Excellence under Lyondell Chemical Company and ARCO Chemical Company. Operational Excellence, based on the Manufacturing Excellence Program launched in 1991 by ARCO Chemical Company, is a program of corporate standards and management systems which incorporates all of the Responsible Care\u00ae  Codes of Management Practices, best practices in the chemical industry, and Bayer\u00bfs own rigorous management systems.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBayer has a contract with Dow (formerly Union Carbide Corporation) to use the Dow Massey Railyard to stage and store chemical raw material railcars until they are needed in the Bayer South Charleston Plant.  Bayer purchased the Lyondell contracts with Union Carbide, and then Dow purchased Union Carbide. Bayer has a contract with Dow to obtain emergency response services from the Dow South Charleston Plant Emergency Response Team.  The South Charleston Plant provides emergency response services to the Dow Massey Railyard.  \n\nThe Dow South Charleston Massey Railyard is committed to storing chemical railcars in a safe and responsible manner.  Dow and Bayer have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.

The Dow Massey Rail Yard is used to temporarily store tank cars for eventual processing at the South Charleston Plant. The rail yard is managed by the South Charleston Plant, but is not considered contiguous by EPA definition with the South Charleston Plant.

Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires that covered stationary sources handling regulated substances conduct off-site consequence analyses (OCA) to evaluate the potential off-site impact of a worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for each regulated toxic chemical on site.  RMP also requires covered sources to evaluate one worst-case scenario and one alternative release scenario for a single chemical representing the class of flammables.  \n\nAll of these scenarios are developed using guidelines established in the RMP rule.  In developing worst-case scenarios, companies must presume the release of the entire quantity of the largest container of a regulated chemical over a 10-minute period.

U.S. EPA acknowledges that these worst-case scenarios are unlikely to occur, so the RMP rule also requires that companies develop alternative release scenarios based on more credible release assumptions. \n\nAlternative release scenarios differ from worst-case scenarios in several important ways.  They may be based on actual incident history or on events which are more likely to occur, and allow the use of both active and passive mitigation to reduce the potential impact of a release on the community outside the facility.\n\nEPA\u00bfs Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Tables were used for evaluating the consequences of the WCS and ARS for both regulated flammable and toxic materials.  Use of these tables resulted in the determination of a release endpoint distance. The EPA-recommended LANDVIEW program was used to estimate the number of people potentially affected in each scenario.  The West Virginia Kanawha/Putnam County Emergency Services Maps and CD-ROM Program were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within the scenario endpoint distance.\n\nAccording to the RMP rule, the release endpoint distance is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected for each scenario.  It is intended to ensure that potential risks to the public health are recognized.  For toxic releases, the endpoint is the distance beyond which chemical concentrations are low enough that an average individual could be exposed for up to one hour without suffering irreversible or debilitating health effects.   For flammable releases, the endpoint distance is that distance beyond which the community would be subject to a pressure wave of less than 1 psi resulting from the formation of an exploding vapor cloud.  Below this value little or no impact to the community is expected.\n\nThe RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst case and alternative case scenarios in our"
