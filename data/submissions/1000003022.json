To comply with the requirements in\n40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF FORT\nWORTH WATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk Management Program\n(RMProgram) for the RHWTP including Management System, Hazard\nAssessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program, and Emergency\nResponse Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the employee and\npublic risk of injury, death or damage from accidental release of\nchemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Manager\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nD.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe RHWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.
