Implementation of corrective actions recommended during the most\n     recent hazard review completed on April 27, 2009.  This effort is\n     one of the most important steps for preventing a chemical release\n     or minimize its effects on plant personnel or the public.\n\nC.   Regular review and revision of operating procedures to address\n     the safely operating procedures for regulated process systems,\n     including all eight (8) elements set forth in the regulation. \n     When combined with the operator training program, current\n     operating procedures are essential in  ensuring safe operation of\n     systems and preventing accidental releases.\n\nD.   Regular review and revision of training programs to ensure plant\n     personnel working on or near regulated processes are adequately\n     trained and understand both inherent process hazards and\n     appropriate response actions to accidental chemical releases. \n     Employees who have received adequate classroom and/or on-the-job\n     training and are currently qualified to safely operate the\n     regulated systems have received certifications  in writing by the\n     RMProgram Manager.  A special training session will be provided\n     to plant personnel working on or near regulated processes as soon\n     as final revisions to operating procedures are completed.\n\nE.   Regular review and revision of the maintenance program to ensure\n     that current, accurate, and complete procedures are provided for\n     process equipment in regulated processes.  Efforts were and are\n     continuously made for the preventative maintenance of equipment\n     per manufacturer's recommendations.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe RHWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.  Although it will not be the responsibility of the plant\nemployees to evacuate offsite areas, addresses and telephone numbers\nof major public receptors inside a one (1) mile radius are provided in\nthe plan.  The CFWWD will work closely with the Emergency Management\nOffice and document coordination activities and communications.\n\n6    ON-GOING AND UP-COMING SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS\n\nTo improve the safety of regulated facilities at t"

To comply with the requirements in\n40 CFR 68 Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, the CITY OF FORT\nWORTH WATER DEPARTMENT (CFWWD) developed a Risk Management Program\n(RMProgram) for the RHWTP including Management System, Hazard\nAssessment, Accidental Release Prevention Program, and Emergency\nResponse Plan.  The RMProgram main goal is to reduce the employee and\npublic risk of injury, death or damage from accidental release of\nchemicals.\n\n1    MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe CFW has the overall responsibility for implementing and\nintegrating the ARPProgram into their organization.  In accordance\nwith the Management System, the CFWWD Director is designated as the\nRMProgram Director, and the Assistant Water Director in charge of\nProduction is the RMProgram Manager.  Other qualified individuals are\nassigned responsibility for implementing each individual requirement\nset forth in the Accidental Release Prevention Program and/or\nEmergency Response Plan.  The RMProgram participants include the\nfollowing positions:\n\nA.   RMProgram Director\nB.   RMProgram Manager\nC.   Hazard Assessment/Offsite Consequence Analysis Update Officer\nD.
