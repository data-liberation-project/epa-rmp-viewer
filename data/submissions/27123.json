      "SummaryText": "Michigan Ethanol will operate an ethanol fuel production plant located Caro, in Tuscola County, Michigan.  As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Michigan Ethanol completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the reporting threshold of 10,000 pounds.  This information is considered to be public knowledge and can be accessed through the Environmental Protection Agency website at  http://www.epa.gov/enviro/index_java.html.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMichigan Ethanol is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the natural gasoline used as the ethanol denaturant as well as the anhydrous ammonia. The ammonia is used for pH control directly in the process feed mixture to fermentation.   The natural gasoline is added to the ethanol to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption.  It is the policy of Michigan Ethanol to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  In the event of an emergency, including an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or denaturant, it is the policy of Michigan Ethanol to notify the Caro Sheriff & Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.  \n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed.  The fuel ethanol production process requires use of a denaturant (natural gasoline) which is reported to contain approximately 40 percent pentane, an RMP regulated substance.  The maximum amount of natural gasoline on-site is estimated to be 380,400 pounds (total pentane is 152,160 pounds).  The natural gasoline is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is introduced to the fuel ethanol in the final stag"

Anhydrous ammonia is also stored on-site and used in the ethanol production process for pH control.  The maximum anhydrous ammonia stored will be 112,000 pounds.  \n\nWorst-Case Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case scenario defined by RMP Guidance is a release of the full contents of the tank in 10 minutes time during the most stable atmospheric conditions, which would be a very unrealistic scenario.  This scenario would be a failure of the natural gasoline (pentane) storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  According to RMP*Comp, a software tool developed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for use in performing off-site consequence analysis, the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to a one pound per square inch overpressure is 0.4 mile.  There are 300 estimated human receptors within the 0.4-mile radius of the plant.  The analysis assumed a release of 152,160 pounds of denaturant (the entire contents of the tank), a wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  This was an overly conservative approach in assuming there are not mitigating measures in place.     \n\nThe worst-case scenario defined by the same guidance as above for the anhydrous ammonia tank assumed a toxic gas cloud of 112,000 pounds (entire contents of the tank) released in 10 minutes.  A wind speed of 3.4 miles per hour and air temperature of 77 degrees F was also assumed for this release.  The maximum distance from the facility for this worst-case release is 4.7 miles.  The estimate number of human receptors within the 4.7 mile radius of the plant includes the Village of Caro and portions of Indianfields and Almer Townships.  These areas encompass an area with an estimated population of approximately 11,500 persons. Once again this is a very unrealistic scenario due to the fact that this scenario does not take ope"

Also, this facility is in operation 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and employees would notice the first sign of any small release.    \n\nAlternative Case Releases\n\nAlternative case scenarios are a more realistic approach to any potential accidental release at the facility due to the fact that mitigating equipment and employee response, if applicable, is taken into account.  The alternative case scenario evaluated using RMP Guidance was a failure of the largest natural gasoline storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud fire.  According to RMP*Comp, the maximum estimated distance from the facility's center to the Lower Flammability Limit for pentane (1.5%) is less than 0.1 mile. The estimated number of human receptors within a 0.1 mile radius of the tank only includes plant personnel and no public receptors.  The analysis assumed a release of 9,850 pounds pentane, a wind speed of 6.7 miles per hour, and an air temperature of 77 degrees F.  The analysis also assumed the release occurs in a diked area since the Michigan Ethanol tank farm is located in a diked secondary containment area.  \n\nThe alternative case scenario was evaluated for a release of anhydrous ammonia as a toxic gas due to a 10-minute release from a 2 inch pipe at a release rate of 472 pounds per minute (total release of 4,720 pounds).  This scenario will affect a distance radius of 0.5 miles from the plant, which would include an estimated 400 public receptors.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, Michigan Ethanol has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on-site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive"
