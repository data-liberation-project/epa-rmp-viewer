In the Program Level 3 designation, Cal/ARP also includes CA Title 8, Section 5189 Process Safety Management as the basis for the Prevention Program component of the Plan/Program. Coastal Cooling is updating its RMP (and the associated submittals) due to a PHA Update conducted 4/1/2020 to bring differing PHA updates and revisions into the same timeline. All 9 sections of the RMP are being updated as a result, within the 6-month window allowed.\r\n\r\nA.\tRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \t\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Coastal Cooling Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies are simply not to have accidental releases or emergencies. The Company endeavors to execute these policies through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety programs include but are not limited to the Process Safety Management Program (PSM) for its Program Level 3 Process. The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The design of the Process in use and the PSM Program are specifically intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if they happen. It is the primary goal of Coastal Cooling to protect its employees, visitors, and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. The protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established as a priority order.\r\n\r\nThe Company recognizes the need to be prepared for accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail.

If and when an ammonia leak is detected, notifications and alarms are triggered according to pre-determined parameters. Our policy is to regularly test and maintain emergency safety systems per our Mechanical Integrity Program, which is intended to ensure proper operation, actuation and function of the refrigeration-related systems and components. The Plant is also equipped with two Ammonia-Water Diffusion Tank Systems (ADT). The function of the ADT systems is to prevent ammonia from venting to atmosphere should a Pressure Relief Valve operate. \r\n\r\nThe Company has adopted a \"Non-responding Facility\" Emergency Response Policy; the Plant's California Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) was developed to be consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements. Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated through the local Certified Unified Program Agency (Monterey County Health Department/CUPA). The CUPA inspects the plant and receives copies of the routinely updated HMBP. It is our policy to maintain RMP/PSM compliance, a good working relationship with the Monterey County Health Department/CUPA, and other Public Emergency Responders that are part of the Monterey County Emergency Response Mutual Aid Agreement. Coastal Cooling's ammonia refrigeration process is supported by Western Precooling Systems (WPS). WPS has a Regional Service Center in Castroville within two miles of the Coastal Cooling facility and is a well-known and reputable supplier of ammonia refrigeration equipment and services. WPS employs experienced ammonia technicians trained beyond 1910.120 \"Awareness\" level.

Both companies participate in and support the annual Salinas Valley Ammonia Safety Day; and the Ammonia Safety Training Institute (ASTI), which are key industry safety icons. \r\n\r\nIt is through these measures, policies, and pre-planning that Coastal Cooling endeavors to maintain effective Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response.\r\n    \r\n2.\tGeneral Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe facility is an ammonia refrigeration plant located in Castroville, CA, in a commercial/industrial area on the SE side of the city. Coastal Cooling, LLC leases the property and refrigerating equipment from WPS, which purchased the facility in 2011. Coastal Cooling, LLC is a California Limited Liability Company owned by Western Precooling Systems (WPS). Prior to WPS purchasing the facility it was owned by D'Arrigo Bothers and leased by Coastal in 2010. \r\n\r\nThe original ammonia refrigeration process was built in 1985 with expansions, modifications and/or upgrades in 1994, 1998, 2014, 2015 & 2016. The facility has been upgraded, expanded and optimized for the pre-cooling, short-term refrigerated storage and shipping of fresh strawberries, and is open year-around with a busy season picking up in early March and continuing through the summer months. Remaining winter months may see little in the way of fresh produce but the refrigerating equipment generally remains operative. Annual refrigerating equipment maintenance is performed during low-season winter months. Portable pressure coolers, MACS pre-coolers, a portable high-side trailer and an associated recirculating package may be moved to other regions at that time, according to regional harvest demand. Portable refrigeration is common in the industry.\r\n\r\nThe Regulated Substance in use is anhydrous ammonia (NH3) CAS #7664-41-7, which is used as the refrigerant in two r"

Refrigerating process equipment overall consists of Compressors, Evaporative Condensers, Room-Unit Evaporators, Room Pressure Cooling Units, MACS Pre-cooling Units, Pressure Vessels, pumps and associated controls, valves, instrumentation, and piping. Pressure, temperature, level controls and safety cut-outs are installed in accordance with appropriate codes & standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves. Pressure relief valves are piped to headers that terminate at one of two ammonia-water diffusion tanks. In addition to automated monitoring via ammonia sensing system and PLC, pre-qualified personnel regularly check the refrigerating process for proper operating parameters.\r\n\r\nSystem 1 consists of a complete high (compression) and low (evaporators) side refrigeration system that supports precooling units (room units & MACS) within the main cold storage facilities. System 2 consists of a complete high and low side refrigeration system that supports room evaporators which are also located inside the main cold storage building. Systems 1 & 2 are interconnected via cross-over valves, and operate independently of each other, however pressure coolers and room evaporators are located within the same building space. System 3 consists of a separate portable closed-loop system including MACS Pre-cooler units (2 of 6 total), a high-side refrigerating trailer, and a re-circulating package that are installed outside of but near the cooler building.

      "SummaryText": "es not require its employees to participate in conducting offensive-type emergency response activities under the HAZWOPER standard; a \"Non-responding Facility Policy\" has been adopted. In the event of an ammonia emergency, the response is to follow the procedures in the Equipment SOP's and the California Hazardous Material Business Plan. The overall procedure is to shut down when and where appropriate and safe, evacuate, and notify the local response agencies and WPS (technical support). Plant employees are to implement hazard communications, provide for the safety of visitors and report to the established Evacuation Staging Area(s) for a head count. Emergency response is coordinated with the County of Monterey Health Department/CUPA and local Fire Department. Coastal Cooling has verified it is included in the Monterey County Area Emergency Plan. \r\n   \r\n6.\tPlanned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\r\n - Process Hazard Analysis\r\n - Compliance Audits\r\n - Routine inspections, tests & maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program)\r\n - IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections (IIAR Safety Criteria for the Safe Operation of Ammonia Refrigeration)\r\n - Coastal Cooling and WPS Internal Inspection Protocols\r\n - Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Programs above may result in recommendations ranging from capital improvements to routine maintenance of the plant. Service calls are established in parallel to identified needs. \r\n\r\nCurrent planned changes to improve safety include the recommendations identified in the most recent Process Hazard Analyses, which was conducted by an experienced team on 4/01/2019 with a follow-up walk-through 4/16/2020. A summary includes administrative & maintenance improvements. These improvements are expected to be completed by 9/25/2020."
