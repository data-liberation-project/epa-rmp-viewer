              "Description": "Prevention Program\n\nThe City of Portland, Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant (CBWTP) is subject to the Program 3 provisions of 40 CFR part 68 as it is governed by OSHA Process Safety Managemenet (PSM) requirements outlined in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As a result, CBWTP has audited the prevention program pursuant to OSHA standards and 40 CFR part 68.  The following is a description of the prevention program for the management of the chlorine facilities at the plant.  \n\nIn addition to the PSM (described below), CBWTP has a Respirator Protection Team responsable for fit testing on Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), cartridge repirators Scram Packs, Skat Packs, Toxilog operation, repair and maintenace of the equipment and reviewing the response procedure.  \n\nThere are randomly scheduled drills on the reponse procedure.  Some drills cover just the response procedures, other drills are \"evelope drills\" where a set of conditions or circumstances are described.  Each drill includes a  debriefing/critique of the drill, as well as a written report. \n\nBrief description of chlorine process \n\nDomestic wastewater carries a variety of human pathogens.  The organisms of greatest concern include the enteric bacteria, enteric viruses, and intestinal parasites.  Bacterial diseases such as salmonellosis, cholera, gastronenteritis,and shigellosis, as well as viral diseases caused by infectious hepatitis virus, poliovirus, coxsackieviruses A and B,echoviruses, reoviruses, and adenoviruses may be contracted by contact with or by consumption of wastewater contaminated water supplies.  Disinfection is necessary to reduce transmission of these infectious diseases when human contact is probable.  \n\nChlorination is used at this facility for disinfection of the clarifier effluent. Chlorine is an effective disinfectant that is used at many wastewater treatment facilities. \n\nThe primary objective of the effluent disinfection is to produce an effluent which meets the discharge limitations of less than 126 e coli per 100 milliliters, a monthly average based on a geometric mean, and 400 e coli per100ml.  The desired goal is to maintain a chlorine residual of less than the permit condition of 1 mg/l in the plant discharge to the river.  Dosing chlorine to the level that destroys all coliform organisms is undesirable due to the potentially adverse impact of chlorine and its by-products.  \n\nChlorination is provided for disinfecting the plant effluent prior to discharge to the Columbia River.  The chlorine storage and feed facilities are located in the Chlorination Building.  Gaseous chlorine is fed under vacuum from the chlorinators are located in the Chlorination Building to machanical injectors in the tunnels.  \n\nA major portion of the disease causing microorganisms is destroyed by a combination of the chlorine concentration in the wastewater and the hydraulic detention time provided in the discharge channel.  In general, the more efficiently the teatment plant is operated, the easier it will be to chlorinate the effluent.  \n\nChlorine is brought to the treatment plant in 90 ton railcars and stored in a containment facility.  The containment facility provides physical containment for any liquid or gas leak in the rail car bays and in the equipment room where the chlorinators and evaporators are located.  Three scrubbers neutralize the contained chlorine.  Two of the scrubbers can remove 10,00 pounds of chlorine each from the rail car bays and the third can remove 150 pounds from the equipment room. An alarm system will activate a local and remote audio alarm when the concentration of chlorine reaches 2 parts per million.  \n\nChlorine leak detectors are provided in the containment rooms and the chlorination room. These units enable continuous monitoring of the air in the rooms for detection of chlorine leaks.  The chlorine leak detectors have a sensing range of 0 to 100 parts per million. A high chlorine alarm is initiated if chlorine is detected in the room atmosphere at concentrations above 1ppm, while a chlorine leak alarm is initiated if the chlorine concentration in one of the rooms reaches 5 ppm.  If a leak is detected, an alarm is sent to the control center, all of the ventilation fans in the chlorination building are turned off, all of the dampers in the building are closed, and the scrubber is activated.  \n\nA simplified flow diagram is available to operations staff in the CL2 process safetly manual and posted at other locations throughout the facility. \n\nProcess Safety Information  \n\nA Process Safety Management Audit was conducted in April, 2004 by Wise Steps Consulting.  This audit consisted of a detailed review of all of the elements in the PSM. A follow up meeting was held and staff assigned to review the recommendations.  \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis   \n\nA hazard analysis was performed in 1995 by a consultant AcuTech Consulting using the HAZOP process.  A hazard analysis was also conducted in April 1999 by the engineering firm CH2M Hill using the same process.  Another hazard analysis was conducted by Wise Steps Consulting in April, 2004.  HAZOP is a thorough systematic approach for identifying, evaluating and controlling the hazards in a process. A team of highly skilled employees familiar with the chemical process has been assembled to review the audit and analysis recommendations.  The team will determine implementatioin strategies and assure that the recommendations are completed. \n\nIn addition to the PSM, CBWTP has a Respirator Protection Team responsible for fit testing on SCBA, cartridge respirators Scram Packs, Skat packs, Toxilog operation, repair and maintenance of the equipment and reviewing the response procedure.  WG employees are highly skilled, trained and drilled on their roles and responsibilities in the event of a chlorine release.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe WG has written operating procedures that are consistent with the PSM information.  Operating procedures have been reviewed by two Operator II's in conjunction with a operations manager.  All three of them are very familiar with the system.  This review will be used to document this year's annual review.  An on-line Operation and Maintenance Manual has been implemented to provide expanded access to operating and safety procedures.\n\nTraining\n\nThe dynamic nature of the industry requires that the WG invest in its employees' knowledge, skills and abilities to ensure that the organization and individuals reach full potential.  WG employees are highly skilled, trained and drilled on their roles and responsibilities in the event of a chlorine release.  An annual drill is held with the local Fire Station as well as the HAZMAT team.  A training module program has been developed that enhances the existing program and verifies competency.  Contractors are provided training on the actions that will be taken if there is a chlorine response drill or leak prior to any work being performed.  As part of our on-going training program, our Respirator Protection Team provides fit testing on Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), cartridge respirators Scram packs, Skat packs, Toxilog operation, repair and maintenance of the equipment and reviews the response procedure.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe WG uses a computerized maintenance system that is work order based.  An employee identifies a problem, enters a work order, the appropriate craft is assigned for repairs, parts are obtained and the equipment is repaired.  A history of maintenance activities are stored on each piece of equipment to evaluate replacement or repair.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nExperience at other facilities has shown that changes made to equipment, systems and processes have been the cause of numerous accidential releases.  The WG has a system for the proper management of changes and modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals and processing conditions.  Effective management will help minimize the chance for an accidental release.  A system that manages changes made to the chlorination process will allow changes to be identified and reviewed before they are implemented to determine if the proposed change would compromise system safety.  \n\nThe CBWTP staff will conduct a management of change (MOC) review for any temporary or permanent change, other than replacement-in-kind, affecting the chlorination process.\n\nIn addition, any large project that would change the chlorination system includes an extensive review process.  This review takes place during project planning, various stages of design review, construction, inspection and start-up.  Oversight of the steps is provided by a Capital Improvement Projects Management Group.\n\nPre-Startup Review\n\nA 13-point checklist has been develoiped for pre-start up.  The checklist is used to verify:  that the constructiion and equipment meet design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; a PHA has been completed and recommendations have been implemented; and employees have been trained.  Other items are specifically directed at safety equipment such as alarm ssytems are working, emergency equipment is available and equipment checks are completed.\n\nCompliance Audit\n\nA compliance audit was performed by Wise Steps Consulting on April 30, 2004.   The audit was conducted by reviewing Section III.A of OSHA Instruction CPL 2-2.45A CH-1, dated September 13, 1994, for all 14 elements of the OSHA PSM program.  The Oregon PSM program and the OSHA PSM program are the same.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAfter each unplanned release and within 48 hours, a team of knowledgeable persons including members from operations, maintenance and management will be formed to investigate the circumstances of the release.  The Investigation should determine the cause of the release and what actions were taken to stop it.  The team will identify measures to prevent future releases and make recommendations to implement those measures.  The team will provide a written report to the PSM manager.\n\nEmployee Participation Program\n\nOperator duties include checking the system periodically to verify safety and proper operation.  Employees have a representative on the WG's safety committee.  Tail gate safety meetings for each work group are held regularly and provide a forum for employer-employee consultation.  The WG has a written Safety Hazard Reporting and Correcting Process providing opportunities for employees to document, evaluate and monitor safety concerns.  The Safety Committee monitors the status of all safety related work orders.  Employees have access to the O & M Manuals, MSDS sheets and PSM.  Contractors are given information related to chlorine and the hazards associated with it as well as what to do in a chlorine emergency.\n\nHot Work Permits\n\nThe WG has a Hot Work Permit Policy which states that the purpose of this procedure is to establish a criteria to insure that all hot work operations are performed in a safe manner to prevent personal injury, fires, or equipment/ property damage.  The policy contains procedures that include responsibilities for each work group, a fire watch, standards, training and special precautions.  Any time hot work is initiated, an individually numbered permit must be filled out.  The permit includes a planning component, a check list, and signatures,  The permit is filed on site.",

The facility is located at 5001 North Columbia Boulevard, Portland, Oregon 97203.\n\nThe liquid chlorine is stored in two 90-ton rail cars that are housed in a 50 by 70 foot chlorination facility that was constructed in 1992.  The chlorine is used in the final stage of treating wastewater to ensure that the effluent is disinfected before discharge to the Columbia River.\n\nChemical Prevention Steps\n\nThe WP has numerous written occupational safety and health programs.  Programs specific to the chemical process are:  process safety management (PSM), energy isolation, respiratory protection, emergency response, personal protective equipment and training/education.  The treatment plant has the containment facility with scrubbers that will neutralize releases.  The WG complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule.  An independent contractor performed an audit in April, 2004.\n\nAccident History\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe WG staff will respond to uinplanned events in a safe, prompt, and responsible manner.  The staff recognizes that each set of conditions will be unique, and unpredictable.  The goal of plant staff is to protect health and safety of the individual, coworkers and neighbors/community, plant equipment and continue to meet all discharge permit requirements.  In order to minimize the amount of chlorine that is released, the plant staff will close the valve at the point of discharge at the tank car.\n\nThe WG also has a comprehensive chlorine response plan that includes a partnership with Portland Fire Bureau and more specifically the Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Public notification of an accidential release is in conjunction with the public safety entities in the area.  Shelter in place, a response procedure requiring citize"

      "SummaryText": "ns to remain indoors with windows, doors and ventilation systems closed, is considered the most appropriate community protection.  The WG has actively discussed this program with the community.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nThe WG had a process safety management audit in April 2004 and a hazard analysis was conducted in April 2004 by Wise Steps Consulting.   A team of highly skilled employees familiar with the chemical process has been assembled to review the audit and analyze recommendations.  The team will determine implementation strategies and assure that the recommendations are completed.\n\nBy December 2005, the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant plans to discontinue the use of chlorine and use sodium hypochlorite for its disinfection processes.\n\nFor further information about the risk management plan and the wastewater treatment services provided by the City of Portland, please contact Joan Saroka at 503-823-5210."
