      "SummaryText": "The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant (CBWTP) is a publicly owned wastewater treatment facility.  It was constructed in 1952 to provide primary treatment of wastewater in the City of Portland.  It was expanded to provide secondary treatment in 1974 and has the capacity to treat 100 million gallons a day (mgd).  The plant has an activated sludge facility and has a reuse program for biosolids.\n\nCBWTP is owned by the City of Portland and managed by the Bureau of Environmental Services Wastewater Group (WG).  The facility serves a population of over 432,000 with approximately 144,787 residential sewer and drainage customers and 12,844 commercial/industrial customers.\n\nThe Bureau of Environmental Services has 450 employees and an annual budget of $153 million.  The Bureau provides policy direction for regulatory programs associated with wastewater treatment and stormwater management.  Programs include industrial pretreatment and source control, water quality investigations and monitoring, watershed planning, combined sewer overflow design and construction, and environmental outreach and education programs.\n\nAccident Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nThe City's Bureau of Environmental Services Wastewater Group (WG) is committed to:\n- being proactive in the prevention of o ccupational risk and injuries/illnesses\n- protecting human, material and organizational wastewater resources, and\n- preserving assets against detrimental loss\n\nThe WG has established a quality risk management philosophy that promotes employee involvement and accountability, and encourages a culture where safety and loss prevention is an internal value that is incorporated in every plan, decision and work activity.  This philosophy extends to the health and well being of the community.\n\nNew chlorination facilities were constructed in 1992 to meet revised Uniform Fire Code requirements for emergency scrubbers.  This facility provides physical containment for any liquid or gas leak in the rail "

Two of the scrubbers can remove 10,000 pounds of chlorine each from the rail car bays and the third can remove 150 pounds from the equipment room.  An alarm system will activate a local and remote audio alarm when the concentration of chlorine reaches 2 parts per million.\n\nThe WG also has a comprehensive chlorine response plan that includes a partnership with Portland Fire Bureau and more specifically the Hazardous Response Team.\n\nWG employees are highly skilled, trained and drilled on their roles and responsibilities in the event of a chlorine release.  The WG has received numerous safety and loss prevention awards and is recognized within the wastewater treatment industry as a leader in safety and loss prevention on the national, regional and local levels.  For example, in 1991, the WG received the Public Employer of the Year Award from Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the American Society of Safety Engineers.  The award recognized efforts to create a safe and healthy employment for Oregonians.  The facility also received the National Safety Council Award, ranking 6th nationally in the Water Resource Division for occupational safety and health.\n\nThe chlorine containment facility received two awards in 1992 from the Consulting Engineering Council of Oregon for Engineering Excellence.  One was the Project of the Year and the other was the Grant Award.  In 1997 the Pacific Northwest Water Pollution Control Association prevented a Safety Award to the WG for leadership in occupational safety and health in the wastewater industry (the third award in six years).  In 1998 Portland City Council recognized the WG Safety Committee for continued efforts in safety and loss prevention and exceeding regulatory requirements for safety committees, and the Safety Action Leadership Team for continued involvement and i"

      "SummaryText": "mplementation of the \"Challenge of Change\", a Safety Perception Survey.\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nEnvironmental Services Wastewater Group manages liquid chlorine at the CBWTP.  The facility is located at 5001 North Columbia Boulevard, Portland, Oregon 97203.\n\nThe liquid chlorine is stored in two 90-ton rail cars that are housed in a 50 by 70 foot chlorination facility that was constructed in 1992.  The chlorine is used in the final stage of treating wastewater to ensure that the effluent is disinfected before discharge to the Columbia River.\n\nChemical Prevention Steps\n\nThe WP has numerous written occupational safety and health programs.  Programs specific to the chemical process are:  process safety management (PSM), energy isolation, respiratory protection, emergency response, personal protective equipment and training/education.  The treatment plant has the containment facility with scrubbers that will neutralize releases.  The WG complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule.  An independent contractor performed an audit in April, 2004.\n\nAccident History\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine in the last 5 years.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nThe WG staff will respond to uinplanned events in a safe, prompt, and responsible manner.  The staff recognizes that each set of conditions will be unique, and unpredictable.  The goal of plant staff is to protect health and safety of the individual, coworkers and neighbors/community, plant equipment and continue to meet all discharge permit requirements.  In order to minimize the amount of chlorine that is released, the plant staff will close the valve at the point of discharge at the tank car.\n\nThe WG also has a comprehensive chlorine response plan that includes a partnership with Portland Fire Bureau and more specifically the Hazardous Materials Response Team.  Public notification of an accidential release is in conjunction with the public safety entities in the area.  Shelter in place, a response procedure requiring citize"

The WG has actively discussed this program with the community.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nThe WG had a process safety management audit in April 2004 and a hazard analysis was conducted in April 2004 by Wise Steps Consulting.   A team of highly skilled employees familiar with the chemical process has been assembled to review the audit and analyze recommendations.  The team will determine implementation strategies and assure that the recommendations are completed.\n\nBy December 2005, the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant plans to discontinue the use of chlorine and use sodium hypochlorite for its disinfection processes.\n\nFor further information about the risk management plan and the wastewater treatment services provided by the City of Portland, please contact Joan Saroka at 503-823-5210."
