The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is anhydrous ammonia. The following topics are addressed in this Executive Summary:\n\n\n\n? Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n? Stationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n? Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n? Emergency Response Plan\n\n? Five Year Accident History\n\n? Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nVentura Foods is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is reflected in a comprehensive accidental release prevention program. This program addresses the design, installation, operation, maintenance, and employee training associated with the process solution equipment at the facility.\n\n\n\nVentura Foods management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities. Ventura Foods's safety and environmental policies as they relate to the ammonia refrigeration system are administered by the PSM Manager, who conducts inspections of the facility to ensure compliance.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe system at 2900 E. Jurupa Street in Ontario, California was constructed in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations including the Uniform Fire and Mechanical Codes at the time of construction. The system has a maximum intended inventory of approximately 19,418 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant from liquid to gas and back again. The system, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycles anhydrous ammonia through various physi"

The condensers are mounted on the roof, and the evaporators, and heat exchangers are located in their respective cold areas.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe Ventura Foods ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with Cal/OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation. The facility conducts routine operations and maintenance, and any necessary minor repairs in house, but an outside contractor is hired for major repairs.\n\n\n\nThe facility including the ammonia system was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code, which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. These safety features include ammonia sensors in the engine room as well as sensors near the evaporators, and automatic shut down systems. \n\n\n\nIn addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the engine room (condensers). All pressure vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves that are commonly piped to the water dilution tanks.\n\n\n\nVentura Foods has developed a preventive maintenance program to complete regularly scheduled inspections and tests of the ammonia refrigeration system as well as repairs as needed to process equipment.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANNING\n\n\n\nThe Ventura Foods facility has an emergency action plan in effect. The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) has been developed by Ventura Foods and is included in the Emergency Planning and "

To minimize and avoid injuries.\n\n? To protect the environment.\n\n? To minimize property damage.\n\n\n\nThe Ventura Foods facility maintains a PSM committee whose members include the designated Emergency Coordinator, as well as Emergency Coordinator alternates for the facility at a minimum. The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures, which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility. This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan is reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\n\n\nThe Ventura Foods facility will coordinate with the local emergency responders (fire department hazardous materials division) to assist with responding to ammonia incidents. The Ventura Foods facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAn investigation into the facility's accident history conducted at the time of the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation Study revealed that there have been no ammonia releases over the past five years (February 2014 to February 2019) that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement mandating immediate reporting of any release or threatened release of a hazardous material. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release, nor any releases that caused property damage onsite or offsite.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazards Analysis (February 13-14, 2019) including a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study and a Facility Inspection, provided mitigation measures to improve safety"
