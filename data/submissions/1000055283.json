Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Vie-Del Company Kingsburg has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n\n\n1.1 Vie-Del Company Kingsburg, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Vie-Del Company Kingsburg has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program. This program has been prepared to address the risks involved in operating and maintaining the following processes which have the presence of hazardous chemicals above threshold quantities: \n\n\n\nProcess Name          | Process Chemical          | Process Quantity(lbs.)\n\nAmmonia Refrigeration   Anhydrous Ammonia           16,000\n\n\n\nOur RMP-PSM program promotes overall plant, worker, and public safety. The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, illnesses and physical property damage.\n\n\n\nOur company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. We have: \n\n1. Prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet "

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors protect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg is a processor of fruit juice, concentrate, wine and spirits. Normal operations are Monday through Friday, and can vary from 9 to 24 hours per day.The exception is the grape crushing season that typically lasts from August through November of each year. Stone fruit processing typically lasts from May through August.\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has one (1) ammonia refrigeration process, which is listed below:\n\n\n\nProcess 1: Ammonia Refrigeration\n\n\n\nTwo (2) Reciprocating Compressors\n\nTwo (2) Evaporative Condensers\n\nOne (1) High Pressure Receiver\n\nTwo (2) Shell-In-Tube Heat Exchangers\n\nOne (1) Vertical Accumulator (Ice Chillers)\n\nTwo (2) B.A.C. Ice Chillers\n\nTwo (2) Oil Pots\n\nOne (1) Diffusion Tank\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is in place to cool products and create chilled water during processing operations.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system utilizes flooded refrigeration design and operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each heat exchanger where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator or directly into the heat exchanger. Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator (or shell of the heat exchanger), and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers w"

During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Vie-Del Company Kingsburg facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. The ammonia process contains a total charge of approximately 16,000 lbs. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n \n\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n- California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\n- Federal"

Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team. \n\n\n\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n\n\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, Vie-Del Company Kingsburg continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\n\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved Vie-Del Company Kingsburg's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Vie-Del Company Kingsburg's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\n\n\n\nVie-Del Company Kingsburg has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\n\n\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Vie-Del Company Kingsburg has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\n\n\n\nFor the future, Vie-Del Company Kingsburg now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".
