The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receiver\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the high pressure receiver is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. The two (2) high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and thermosyphon vessel and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receivers are equipped with a single main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nFlooded Accumulator\n\n\n\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a grea"

To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporator (Direct Expansion)\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporator is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The Loading Dock South Coil receives liquid from the high pressure receiver. The evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporator. The evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\n\nMain Suction Accumulator\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumu"

The liquid transfer vessel receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into High Pressure Receiver 1. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\nCompressors\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\nEvaporative Condensers\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers and thermosyphon vessel. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers and thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nThermosyphon Vessel\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the the"

The thermosyphon vessel receives high pressure liquid from the condensers and supplies high pressure liquid to the thermosyphon oil cooler on each screw compressor. Excess liquid in the thermosyphon vessel is piped to High Pressure Receiver 1. High pressure ammonia vapor formed in each oil cooler is returned to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the thermosyphon vessel contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nOil Cooler\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the oil coolers is to remove heat from the oil being circulated through them. The oil coolers receive liquid from the thermosyphon vessel. High pressure liquid and vapor exits the oil coolers and is returned to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the oil coolers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nSafety Systems\n\n\n\nThe machinery room and refrigerated rooms are each equipped with ammonia detection. The detection system is interlocked with the refrigeration system controls as follows:\n\nAmmonia concentration monitors are installed outside the machinery room to display the current concentration inside the room;\n\n\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm in the machinery room, audible and visual alarms are activated outside the room. Additionally, the emergency ventilation rate of the fan is activated.\n\n\n\nIf the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm in the refrigerated rooms, an auto-dialer sends a notification to necessary personnel. \n\n\n\nThe Emergency Control Box (ECB) is installed on the outside wall of the machinery room and contains four (4) valves.\n\n\n\nValve #1: High to Low Pressure Control Valve\n\nValve #2: Low Side Discharge Valve\n\nValve #3 (AV-205): High Side Discharge Valve HPR 1\n\nValve #4 (AV-206): High Side Discharge Valve HPR 2\n\n\n\nOpening Valve #1 will equalize the high and low pressure portions of the system.

      "SummaryText": "s are equipped with a relief vent indicator (RVI) to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. Indicator flags are mounted to the shaft of the RVI on the outside of the housing. A paddle is set such that any sudden flow in the relief vent line pushes it down simultaneously raising the flags which then provide a clear signal that a relief valve has lifted. Stoppers mounted to the exterior prevent the flag/shaft from rotating more than the 90? swing;\n\n\n\nThe main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high liquid level in the vessel. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\n\n\n\nProcess Classification\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Mountain View Cold Storage consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at Mountain View Cold Storage is treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nMountain View Cold Storage has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Mountain View Cold Storage facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are"
