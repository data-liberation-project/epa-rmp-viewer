THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE \n514, 000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE (LARGEST STORAGE TANK) AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 2.7 MILES.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.
