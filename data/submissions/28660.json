      "SummaryText": "Shell Puget Sound Refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nShell Puget Sound Refinery, located in Anacortes, Washington, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, gasoline) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are also regulated substances.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 2 and 3 processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing normal Butane. No administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, the full tank inventory of 2,340,000 lb is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE, with a 1-psi overpressure.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of n-butane from a rail car located at the railcar loading rack facility (154,000 lb released over a 10-minute period). This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  Although we have numero"

Although previous Shell Puget Sound Refinery?s RMP Reports have included planning for an ammonia tank, this represents an historical artifact dating to prior combined ownership of the Refinery and the adjacent cogeneration facility.  However, over the years that combined ownership changed.  Since then, separate Title V air-operating permits have been issued to each facility.  In March 2002, the name of the Refinery was changed since, at that time, Texaco and Shell terminated their alliance and Shell Oil Products US became the sole shareholder of Equilon Enterprises LLC.  Equilon Enterprises LLC remains the owner of the Refinery and the Refinery operates as the Shell Puget Sound Refinery.   The ammonia tank is owned by March Point Cogeneration Company (MPCC), part of the cogeneration facility's processes, and located, along with the rest of the cogeneration facility, within the fence line of the Refinery on land that the Refinery leases to March Point Cogeneration Company.  Although the cogeneration facility provides some ammonia to the Refinery for its use in an electrostatic precipitator, the amount of ammonia present in a process at the Refinery is below the threshold triggering RMP planning.  March Point Cogeneration Company will assume the reporting and RMP responsibilities for the ammonia tank by the end of June 2003.  Shell has also listed a release of hydrogen sulfide in its list of Alternate Release Scenarios, however, because no Worst Case Scenario is now listed, no ARS are allowed in the reporting software.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nShell Puget Sound Refinery has had one RMP-related accident over the past 5 years; a fire on its Delayed Coking Unit.

That event did not result in injuries or other offsite impacts as defined by the RMP beyond the refinery fence line.  For the previous five years, there has not been any other injury inside or outside of the refinery caused by an RMP-covered accidental release of RMP-listed materials.  We investigate accidents to determine ways to help prevent similar accidents from occurring. \n \n\n \n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at Shell Puget Sound Refinery.  Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nShell Puget Sound Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each PSM program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. Through the BEST (Behavioral Education for a Safer Today) Program, employees have designed and implemented a behavior based safety program which encourages modifications to behavior to work safer.  This program utilizes peer observations of work practices and participation on safety teams.  The program has the stated goal that \"We all retu"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response / exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  The refinery process uses controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). \n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nShell Puget Sound Refinery has a comprehensive program to help identify and control recognized hazards associated with the various processes. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to recognize hazards and to verify that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\nShell Puget Sound Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform "

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  \n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Shell Puget Sound Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  There is a training program that is designed to provide new operators with basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After attending the training program, new operators are paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to help maintain their skills and knowledge.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.\n\nContractors\n\nShell Puget Sound Refinery uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place so that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

Refinery personnel periodically monitor various contractor?s safety performance to confirm that such contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nShell Puget Sound Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nShell Puget Sound Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
