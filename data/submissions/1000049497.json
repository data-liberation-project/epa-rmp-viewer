      "SummaryText": "RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAleutian Propane Sales facility is located in the southwestern area of Alaska, on Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Islands, eight hundred forty air miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska.\r\n\r\nAleutian Propane Sales is a full service propane dealer. At our facility we fill propane tanks and cylinders of various sizes for homeowners, contractors, and the seafood industry. We provide delivery service to homeowners, restaurants, and other businesses.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance that is handled and stored at our facility is propane (LP Gas).  Our facility has the capacity to store 53,633 gallons of propane, although we normally store approximately 20,000 gallons at one time.  Our inventory varies depending on receipt of propane shipment and seasonal high and lows usage rates throughout the year.\r\n\r\nOur worst case scenario would be if a hose or valve were to leak on our 10,800-gallon tank.  This tank when filled to maximum capacity eighty seven per-cent (87%) would have nine thousand-four hundred and fifty gallons (9,450) of propane.  \r\n\r\nWe have conducted our own modeling along with our supplier and believe that there would not be any off site impact to the community if there were a propane leak.  We have based this on the following, the wind conditions in our area are constant in that there is always a breeze coming off the ocean, which would dissipate the propane vapor reducing the chances of an explosion or fire.  Secondly the only time propane gas is transferred from tank to tank is when a trained person is doing it.  At no time is any propane valve ever opened unless a trained individual is present and is performing the transfer.\r\n\r\nIf a leak were to occur, the amount to propane would be less than one hundred gallons (100) due to the onsite individual that is overseeing the process of transferring of propane.  All of our personal are trained in the operation of emergency shut off valves, and their location.  All of our tanks are equipped with e"

All of our equipment is inspected on a regular basis and is documented on a maintenance form.  \r\n\r\nAll procedures for transferring propane or using propane-related equipment are written in the company procedures.\r\n\r\nThe layout of our facility is in accordance with the State of Alaska Fire Marshall, the City of Unalaska's Fire Department and NFPA 54.  \r\n\r\nAll of our propane transferring is in accordance with NFPA and OSHA.\r\n\r\nIn over twenty (20) years of operation, there has never been a reportable accident at the APS Facility.\r\n\r\nIf a propane leak were to occur our procedures require that the onsite individual that observes the leak is to stop the leak by operating the emergency shut off valve.  When the leak has been stopped then notify the company owners and the local Public Safety Department.
