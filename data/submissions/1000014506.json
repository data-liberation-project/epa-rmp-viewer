In addition to these safety systems and protocols, highly \ntrained employees and contractors take active roles in key design, maintenance and\noperational programs intended to prevent releases, as well as, well developed and \nrehearsed emergency response systems.

These assessments consist of determining  \n\"worst case\" and \"alternative case\" scenarios as specified by the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA).

The plan is organized into\nthree main sections - general facility information, the core plan and associated\nsupport information or \"annexes\" - and provides this information in a format\ndesigned to meet EPA and Coast Guard requirements specified in 40 CFR 112.20\nand 33 CFR 154.1010-1065.\n\nThe plan describes response objectives and priorities, mobilization and \nimplementation of response resources including the OSRO (Oil Spill Response\nOrganization) retained for larger responses and detailed information concerning:\n * Facility layout\n * Required notifications\n * Response management organization and responsibility assignments\n * Incident documentation, critique and follow up\n * Training & drills\n * Prevention\n * Required certifications\n * Consistency with area and national contingency plans\n\n\nThe SPCC (Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure) Plan & Hazardous \nMaterials Contingency Plan contains all of the elements required by 40 CFR 112.7 \n(SPCC Plans) and 262.34.  Specifically, the present plan contains the following \ninformation:\n * General Site & Refinery Operational Description\n * Identification of Potential Spill Sites, Drainage and Containment\n * Contingency Plan for Spills, Fires or Explosions\n * Listing of Emergency Response Equipment\n * Evacuation Plan for Refinery Personnel\n * Inspection Methods and Procedures for Early Detection of Releases/Spills\n * Chemical/Waste Inventory\n * Security\n *"

Regular emergency planning meetings and two drills per year are held \nwith appropriate officials of Krotz Springs and the St. Landry Parish Office of\nEmergency Planning to determine ways in which coordination, communication and\ninteractions can be improved.  In addition, the refinery has developed a Natural \nResources Damage Assessment baseline in the event a spill or release occurs\nto better be able to measure the extent of impact of an incident.\n\n\n  2.0\tEmergency Response Equipment Inspection, Testing & Maintenance\n\nThe refinery has a well developed inspection, testing and maintenance program\nfor all safety systems and emergency response equipment.  The program is\ndescribed in detail in the Safety Systems Inspection and Testing Manual that\nexists on-line in an Impact database.

In addition, a\nnew community alert signal, evacuation and shelter in place protocols have\nbeen put into place.\n \n\n  4.0\tTraining for All Employees in Relevant Procedures\n\nEmployees receive training primarily through regular monthly emergency response\ndrills composed to simulate conceivable unplanned events that either could or\nhave happened in the refinery.  Through these drills, employees receive\ntraining on reporting of various types of emergencies, responding to plant\nalarms, mustering and roll checking, evacuation and sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency response team members participate in monthly training sessions and \nmonthly drills.  The monthly training/drills include topics and events which\nrehearse the following types of responses, either singularly or in a complex\ncombination:\n * Fire or flammable gas release response\n * Medical response\n * Rescue/extrication\n * Chemical or spill response\n * Oil spill response\n * Gas testing\n * Emergency response organization (incident command system)\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFuture plans to improve safety are developed through several venues including the \nEmployee Safety Hazard Reporting & Follow Up, the KREST Committee, Process Hazard Analyses, \nand the Employee Safety and Health Committee.  These safety action items are implemented \nthrough individual employees, employee committees or teams, and are completed through the \nuse of the work order system, the management of change procedure and the pre-startup safety \nprocedure.  The following types of changes are planned:\n  \n1. Continue to train employees in all aspects of their job.\n2. Continue to consider and implement recommendations from Process Hazard \n   Analyses where technologically feasible, and there is a proven benefit to the\n   safety and/or operations of the process.\n3.
