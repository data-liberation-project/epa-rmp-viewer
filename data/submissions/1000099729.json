We provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees through safety stand downs, town hall meetings, and monthly leadership meetings. We continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employees' level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety, health, and environmental performance.\r\n\r\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe company started construction on a crude process unit in 2019 to produce Marine Grade Fuels. With this addition, there was a need to capture liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) produced from the unit.  The captured LPG will be stored in two, 45K Gallon ASME pressure vessels equipped with LPG tanker truck loading facilities.\r\n\r\nThe LPG storage and loading area is built to store and transfer LPG.  The LPG is delivered, via a 4-inch mixed LPG supply pipeline to the LPG Station from the onsite Crude Processing Unit, operated by Texas International Refining Company (TIRCO). Vapor recovery is provided by the use of a 4-inch line. \r\n\r\nThe LPG is stored in two (45,000-gallon) pressurized bullet tanks.
