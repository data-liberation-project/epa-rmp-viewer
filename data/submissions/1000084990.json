The ATI facility at 1600 Old Salem Road in Albany, Oregon has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations which may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors. \n\n\n\nThe facility plans to meet or exceed regulatory requirements. In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at the facility have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents and releases. The RMP regulated chemicals include chlorine and aqueous ammonia. \n\n\n\nPrograms have been developed to comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and EPA's 40 CFR part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions in the Risk Management Program.\n\n\n\n2.The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. \n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to extract zirconium and hafnium metal from zirconium oxides and produce various metal alloy products. These products are sold to customers who produce final products for the nuclear industry, the industrial chemical process industry and other related industries. Zirconium chemical products as well as byproducts are also sold. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substances handled at th"

The development of the worst-case scenario is dictated by the EPA. The amount of the substance released for the worst-case scenario is equal to the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe line. For toxic chemicals that are normally gases at ambient temperature and are handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the chemical is assumed to be released as a gas over 10 minutes. The release rate to the atmosphere is calculated as the quantity released divided by 10 minutes unless passive mitigation is in place. \n\n\n\nThe alternative case release scenarios for the regulated toxic substances were developed by ATI based upon experience with the substances. These scenarios are considered more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarios. However, the alternative case release scenarios are still considered unlikely to occur. As part of its release prevention program, discussed in detail in the next section, ATI is constantly monitoring, reviewing, and upgrading its standard operating procedures and equipment. In addition, ATI has developed a detailed Emergency Action Plan (EAP)to minimize the effects of a release should one occur. In addition to these administrative controls, ATI has automatic release mitigation systems in place for the regulated substances, which are discussed below. \n\n\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case and alternative case scenarios for each substance was calculated using EPA's RMPComp computer "

The RMPComp model is considered conservative and would generally give longer distances than computer modeling developed specifically for ATI. \n\n\n\nFor the following reasons the 2019 modeling used to calculate distance to the toxic endpoint continues to be valid: \n\n?Amounts of regulated substances handled at ATI have been reduced due to the elimination of on-site storage of phosgene and titanium tetrachloride. This elimination is due to process changes from the substitution of raw material feed stocks.\n\n?The worst-case and alternative case scenarios for chlorine and aqueous ammonia are unchanged.\n\n?The worst-case and alternative case scenarios for phosgene and titanium tetrachloride have been deleted.\n\n?The population numbers were updated using 2010 U.S. Census data.\n\n\n\n4.The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements which will help the facility to minimize releases of regulated substances. A description of each of the elements is given below: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\n\n\nThe Facility has involved employees in the development and implementation of the elements of Process Safety Management and the Prevention Program. ATI encourages employees to participate with the understanding that their participation is a key factor to the success of any program. ATI is committed to maintaining a safe workplace, and as a result all employees are responsible for adhering to the PSM/RMP regulations. ATI has committed to the following: \n\n?Including employees from the process in Process Hazard Analyses \n\n?Consulting employees on the development of PSM/RMP regulation elements \n\n?Providing employees with access to the information developed through the PSM and RMP rules. \n\n\n\nA description of the Employee Participation Program is provided in the Process Safe"

This initial training also includes emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards, emergency operations including shutdown, and safe work practices applicable to the employee's job tasks. \n\n\n\nRefresher training is provided at least every three years to employees involved in operating a regulated process to assure that the employee understands and adheres to the current standard operating procedures of the process. \n\n\n\nATI verifies that each employee involved in operating a regulated process has received and understood the required training. A record will be prepared that contains the identity of the employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training. \n\n\n\nThe training programs and documentation are available through ATI Connect and ATI internal Document Control.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. \n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the covered processes that would require a modified emergency response. \n\n\n\nA 24 hour a day Senior Emergency Response Official is assigned to respond to any accidental release, should one occur. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan, which is maintained at the facility, contains the following elements: \n\n?Procedures for informing the public and local emergency response agencies about accidental releases. \n\n?Documentation of proper first-aid and emergency medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures. \n\n?Procedures and measures for emergency response after an accidental release of a regulated substance. \n\n?Procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection, testing, and maintenance. \n\n?Training for all employees in relevant procedures. \n\n?Procedures to review and update, as appropriate, the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the stationary source and"

Noted below are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at the facility. These changes are under consideration: \n\n?Update P&ID's\n\n?Improved gas scrubber at Sublimation. \n\n?Centralization of chlorination process areas. \n\n\n\nSeveral changes have been made to processes as a result of PSM and RMP program reviews: \n\n?Deleted anhydrous ammonia and replaced with 28% aqueous ammonia. \n\n?Deleted sulfur dioxide and first replaced with 50% hydrogen peroxide and then replaced 50% hydrogen peroxide with sodium bisulfite. \n\n?Replaced existing chlorine railcar unloading station and vaporizers with a new chlorine railcar unloading station with vaporizer/super-heater, such that the chlorine in pipes is largely limited to gaseous chlorine, not liquefied chlorine as in the past. \n\n?Eliminated use of one-ton chlorine tank in water treatment system. \n\n?Eliminated use of 70% hydrofluoric acid, replaced with 45% hydrofluoric acid. \n\n?Added two new 28% aqueous ammonia storage tanks. \n\n?Installed new courtyard caustic scrubber. \n\n?UniPro LT Chlorine shut-off valve system installed on each chlorine car unloading station railcar. \n\n?Implemented partial processing of crude silicon tetrachloride to reduce onsite storage volumes.
