Facility Policy.\n    \n    The owners, management and employees of Montrose Elevator, Inc. (the facility)\nare committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an\naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\ndepartment, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the\npeople and the environment.  \n    \n2.    Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient \nfor crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 290,000 pounds. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\nreleased as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the\nend point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.2 miles.  \n\nb.    The alternate release scenario: a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate scenario\nfollowed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down\nvalve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. \nThe maximum quantity would be 27,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of\ndispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 mile (The most likely potential incident would be a release\nfrom a break in a 1-inch transfer hose release scenario followed by release of ammonia for\n2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote\nmanual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.

Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety\nRequirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by\nThe American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S.\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and\nhandling of anhydrous ammonia\".  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by\nIowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and \nhandling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration\nForm Section 8.3.(b).\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\nhave caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our\nknowledge has there veen any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries,\nevacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\n    a.    a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community\nright-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n    \n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions of Agrineed, Inc.  There are no\nadditional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous\nammonia for implementation at this time."
