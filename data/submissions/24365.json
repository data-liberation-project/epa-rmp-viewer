(the facility)\nare committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an\naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire\ndepartment, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the\npeople and the environment.  \n\t\n2.\tFacility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient \nfor crop production.  The maximum quantity stored would be 290,000 pounds. \n\n3.\tWorst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.\tThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\nreleased as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be\n130,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the\nend point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 1.2 miles.  \n\nb.\tThe alternate release scenario: a 3-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate scenario\nfollowed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down\nvalve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. \nThe maximum quantity would be 27,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint (point of\ndispersion to 200 ppm) is .60 mile (The most likely potential incident would be a release\nfrom a break in a 1-inch transfer hose release scenario followed by release of ammonia for\n2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote\nmanual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia.
