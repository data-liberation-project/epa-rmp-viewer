The potential for future releases has been addressed through the development and implementation of the facility PSM Program.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is covered in Part 6 of the Process Safety Management Plan. The Nash Finch Omaha facility has a detailed Emergency Response Plan that covers the specific hazards associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia in its refrigeration system. The purpose of the Plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop as a result of an ammonia leak or release. This program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release and the public, and includes information for emergency health care.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nNash Finch Omaha incorporates changes resulting from the facility process hazard review, management of change procedures, compliance audits and incident reviews, where applicable, to help improve the overall safety related to the use and m"

We comply with all applicable federal, state and local safety and environmental laws and regulations. \r\n\r\nIn response to this Policy, Nash Finch ensures that adequate resources and technology are provided to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from its distribution centers. All associates are trained regarding the hazards of ammonia during their initial orientation training session. Maintenance and other personnel receive specialized training regarding the hazards of ammonia and the operation of the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nFacility and the regulated substance handled\r\n\r\nNash Finch Company operates a food distribution center at 4228 south 72nd Street in Omaha Nebraska. The facility receives and stores grocery product for eventual distribution to Nash Finch and independent grocery stores in the Omaha area and throughout Nebraska and Western Iowa. Grocery products include dry goods, frozen products as well as meat and other perishable items. As part of this operation, perishable and frozen food storage areas are cooled using a refrigeration system containing anhydrous ammonia (the regulated substance). Ammonia is a particularly good refrigerant in that it is a naturally occurring compound,"
