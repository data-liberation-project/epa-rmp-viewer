              "Description": "In accordance with sections 68.65 through 68.87, Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake has implemented a program 3 prevention program for the following process;\n\n* Chlorine Storage Area for Wastewater Treatment Plant\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION: In accordance with Section 68.65 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake systematically controls the creation, updating, and retention of written documentation associated with its process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment. This information is essential for supporting all of the other elements of the risk management program. This information is also used directly to ensure that its equipment is suitable for its intended use.\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS: In accordance with Section 68.67 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake uses Operational Risk Management  (ORMs) to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards. The most critical products of the ORMs are recommendations for reducing the most significant risks of accidental chemical releases. NAWS China Lake ensures that all recommendations from its ORMs are resolved appropriately, and ensures that the information from our ORMs (including recommended resolutions) is communicated to all potentially affected employees. The most current ORM was done in July 2008.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES:  In accordance with Section 68.69 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake uses Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to define how process-related job tasks assigned to its personnel should be performed to avoid incidents. Management uses these SOPs to (a) train employees/contractors before they perform tasks in the field, (b) serve as reference guides for personnel performing tasks, and (c) specify what to do if a process upset or operating emergency occurs.\n\nTRAINING:  In accordance with Section 68.71 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake trains its employees to safely perform their assigned tasks. The training program includes initial on the job training as well as periodic refresher training and training updates when major process/equipment changes are made.  An integral part of the training program are field demonstrations, etc to show proficiency and understanding of the processes.\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY: In accordance with Section 68.73 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake maintains the Mechanical Integrity (MI) of our process equipment using an inspection, testing, and quality assurance program. Additionally, China Lake ensures that its equipment is designed, manufactured, and installed correctly to ensure that it operates properly. Maintenance personnel are trained with regard to the hazards of the process as well as on the proper procedures for maintaining the ongoing integrity of the equipment that job tasks are performed safely.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE: In accordance with Section 68.75 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake is developing a Management of Change (MOC) program to evaluate and approve all proposed changes (e.g., modifications that are not replacements in kind) to covered process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures prior to implementation through. This program will help ensure that inadvertent or unintended changes are prevented, that any safety and health impacts are addressed, that affected employees are informed of and trained in the approved changes. Close scrutiny of all changes is used to help ensure that changes do not adversely impact employees, public safety, and the environment.\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW: In accordance with Section 68.77 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake performs a pre-startup review as a final check to ensure the safety of a new or modified process prior to placement in service.\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS: In accordance with Section 68.79 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake audits our RMP covered processes to ensure that our prevention programs are, in fact, effective. The compliance audit program seeks to confirm that RMP prevention program practices for the covered processes are consistent with written programs, that the programs adequately address all the requirements of the RMP regulations, and that management systems are in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS: In accordance with Section 68.81 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake performs incident investigations to help ensure that incidents of catastrophic magnitude or potential are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are disseminated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence.\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION: In accordance with Section 68.83 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake has an employee participation plan that ensures that all employees are involved in the development and implementation of the RMP.\n\nHOT WORK PERMITS: In accordance with Section 68.85 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake uses its hot work permit program to ensure that OSHA's fire prevention and protection precautions, specified in 29 CFR 1910.252 (a), are in place prior to the start of hot work (tasks involving electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing, or other operations involving flame or spark generation) on or near an RMP covered process.\n\nCONTRACTORS: In accordance with Section 68.87 of the RMP rule, NAWS China Lake has a contractor screening procedure to assist in the assurance that only contractors who accomplish the desired tasks without compromising the safety and health of our employees, the public, and the environment are hired and utilized.",

      "SummaryText": "hat the change of process chemistry involved much more than a simple \"drop-in\" replacement. Aside from the Hypochlorite solution, other supporting chemicals had to be used. The change would have additionally required major construction to our facility and the procurement and installation of additional reaction vessels. This would have necessitated the initiation of a Military Construction (MILCON) request. If granted the MILCON would, in and of itself, have been cost prohibitive without factoring in the additional cost of the reaction vessels, addition chemicals, and increased manpower to operate the new process. For these reasons the change was deemed not feasible at this time. NAWS China Lake continues to watch for alternative technologies and processes for its wastewater treatment system."
