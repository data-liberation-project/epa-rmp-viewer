We manufacture flexible polyurethane foam into prime, rebond and molded foam products.  In addition, we blend polyurethane systems for use by other end product manufacturers.  In our process, we use the following chemical that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.\n\nToxics\n\nToluene Diisocyanate (Mixed Isomers)\tCAS No.:  26471-62-5\n\nWe have storage capacity for approximately 107,700 gallons of TDI inside the plant in ten (10) bulk tanks located in tank pits or diked tank farms.  Our rail siding has the capability for up to twelve (12) rail and/or boxcars.  We normally have about 3-4 railcars of TDI on hand at any given time.  A railcar will hold 190,000 lbs of"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\u00bf\tProcess safety information\n\u00bf\tProcess hazard analysis\n\u00bf\tOperating procedures\n\u00bf\tTraining\n\u00bf\tPre-startup review\n\u00bf\tCompliance audits\n\u00bf\tIncident investigation\n\u00bf\tEmployee participation \n\u00bf\tHot work permit\n\u00bf\tContractor compliance\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nTDI unloading is conducted in accordance with accepted industry practices and in full compliance with internal operating and safety procedures.\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems provide and have integrated these standards into the way we do business.  We also have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n \n\n5.2.4\tFive-year Accident History\n\nWe will keep records for all significant accidental releases that occur at our facility.  There have been no accidents involving TDI with off-site consequences during the past five (5) years, or the past twenty-four (24) years of operations in Elkhart.\n\nThere has been an incident of an on-site release however which has caused an on-site injury to one of our employees.  This incident occurred on October 29, 2007.  A formal incident investigation was conducted, a root cause was determined and corrective action was taken"

      "SummaryText": "to prevent any further incidents.\n\n\n5.2.5\tEmergency Response Program\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency responders.  Our response capability is limited to small spills and limited incidents.  Large spills are to be referred to local Hazmat responders for assistance.\n\n\n5.2.6\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to review and potentially implement to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\u00bf\tContinue to provide training programs on the safe handling of TDI during unloading operations and routine maintenance procedures.  We will also focus on updating training materials and expanding the scope of employee training to a larger group of people.\n\u00bf\tExplore the possibility of adding some type of containment to our rail siding to reduce the pool size created by a worse-case spill scenario."
