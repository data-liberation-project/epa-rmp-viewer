      "SummaryText": "The CO2 facility in Oregon, OH produces liquid and solid carbon dioxide used in carbonation of beverages, food processing and preservation, pH control of water, fire protection and other applications. The plant was stared up in 1968 and has 20 employees. Ammonia is the RMP regulated substance which is used in the process as a refrigerant to cool and liquefy the CO2.\n\nThe worst case scenario is a catastrophic line failure releasing the entire contents from our largest vessel in 10 minutes with no mitigation controls and worst cause meteorological conditions. The vapor cloud length would be 0.9 miles to an endpoint of 200 ppm.  This type of release would have offsite impact.\n\nAn alternative case scenario is a < inch diameter leak in a line.  Emergency systems would isolate parts of the ammonia system resulting in a release of 8000 lbs. at a rate of 122 pounds per minute. The vapor cloud length would be .27 miles to an end point of 200ppm.  This release would have offsite impacts.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is based on proper design, maintenance, operation and auditing of our operation.  Specifics include industry standard vessel design and construction, shutdown systems, predictive and preventive maintenance, routine inspections of equipment, formal hazard analysis studies, operation and maintenance audits of equipment an systems, and investigation of accidents and incidents.\n\nOur emergency response program is based on training and preparation including emergency response training, planning with the Oregon Fire Department and partnering with the Lucas County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nThere have been no offsite incidents of consequence in the last five years at this site."
