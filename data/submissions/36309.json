It is our policy to adhere to all federal, state, and local rules and regulations.  To provide additional safety, this substance is contained in an underground storage tank (UST), which provides passive mitigation.  This UST complies with all applicable Federal requirements pursuant to 40 CFR 280, which includes U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) UST upgrade requirements.  Additionally, the process equipment is designed to comply with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Code 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately contact the Bedford Park Fire Department by dialing 911.  The Fire Department is also coordinated with the Cook County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This company takes a proactive position to reduce the risk of accidents occurring at this facility and is proud of its safety record.  A summary of the accident prevention program follows.\n\n\n?68.155(b) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThis facility uses isopentane as a blowing agent in the polymer extrusion process for the manufacture of foam packaging products.  A low-pressure pneumatic pump at the UST transports the isopentane to a set of mechanical high-pressure pumps at the pump house, which then delivers the isopentane to the process lines in the manufacturing building.  \n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees and authorized contractors.  A contractor delivers the regulated substance (isopentane) by transport truck.  The transfer of isopentane is gravity fed to the UST.  The UST is vented to maintain atmospheric pressure.

An overpressure of 1 psi may cause partial demolition of houses and shatter glass windows.  It should be recognized that the fact that the tank is underground does provide passive mitigation.  The EPA offsite consequence analysis (OCA) guidance, Chapter 4, page 4-11, Q's and A's, Worst-Case and Mitigation, does address UST's: \"The worst case scenario for salt domes would be examined in a manner similar to that for underground storage tanks.  Reservoirs or vessels sufficiently buried underground are passively mitigated or prevented from failing catastrophically.  You should evaluate the failure of piping to underground storage for the worst-case and alternative scenarios.\"  The piping to the UST is also below grade and is double-walled.\n\n\n\nA pull-away hose failure from the tranport tank truck was used for the worst-case and alternative release scarios.
