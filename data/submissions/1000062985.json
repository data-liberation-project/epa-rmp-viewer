              "Description": "The HF Alkylation process includes the equipment for the HF Alkylation process, Selective Hydrogenation Process (SHP), Rapid De-Inventory System and water deluge system for the HF Alkylation unit. The Alky unit combines butylene produced from the FCCU and isobutane in the presence of hydrogen fluoride to form alkylate.  The Alky also yields normal butane and propane that have entered the system with the charge.  The SHP saturates 1,3 butadiene in the alky feed with hydrogen, and with catalyst, reacts to form 1-butene 2-butene. The 1-butene is then further converted with hydrogen to all 2-butene. The refinery's Worst Case Scenario (WCS) is generated from the Alky unit.  If for some reason an unplanned event in the unit would result in its shutdown, all the HF acid would be transferred to vessel 03FA364.  If this vessel catastrophically failed during this event, the entire unit inventory of HF acid would be lost.  The final toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/l is based on approximately 321,000 lbs. of hydrogen fluoride being released over a 10 minute period.  Additionally, the Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) also comes from the Alky Unit, resulting when a seal fails on the HF acid recirculation pump, 03GA336, also measured to a final toxic endpoint of 0.016 mg/l. OSHA's Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68 are applied equally refinery wide to all process units containing threshold quantities of highly hazardous chemicals and regulated substances.",

              "Description": "The West Refinery Tankage has the primary responsibility of receiving, transferring, storing, and shipping the various feedstocks for and products produced by, the facility.  The site's flammable WCS is part of this process, which would be a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) resulting from a catastrophic loss of containment of 08FB223 , which contains mixed pentanes. Additionally, a second flammable WCS has been included in the submittal, as it could potentially have different receptors.  It is also a VCE resulting from a catastrophic loss of containment of a storage tank, 08FB204, also containing mixed pentanes.  Both impacted areas were determined using the maximum impact distance endpoint of 1 psi. The site's flammable ARS is based on a seal pump failure on 08GA826 which supports tank 08FB204, resulting in a VCE to a maximum impact distance endpoint of 1 psi.  OSHA's Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA's Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68 are applied equally refinery wide to all process units containing threshold quantities of highly hazardous chemicals and regulated substances.",

The NHT unit uses a catalytic refining process to remove catalyst poisons from a straight run cracked naphtha stream. It then routes the purified naphtha to the CCR complex, where it is catalytically reformed in the presence of hydrogen into aromatics for fractionation.  The Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) unit removes sulfur from petroleum products and has been evaluated to be co-located with the CCR-NHT unit. Both the CCR-NHT unit and the HDS unit are therefore considered a single covered process.

      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nFlint Hills Resources Corpus Christi, LLC (FHR) is owner and operator of two petroleum refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas and has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and incorporating safety into the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. This update is being submitted because of major modifications to a process unit.  This RMP is for FHR West Refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. \n\nThe FHR facility at Corpus Christi performs a number of processing functions that would traditionally be classified as Petrochemical Refining and Specialty Chemical Processing. For the remainder of this submittal, the FHR West refinery in Corpus Christi will be referred to as 'FHR' and the primary processing function at the facility will be generically referred to as 'Refining.'\n\nFHR's emergency response capabilities include a 24-hour, 365 day/year, fully paid, in-plant industrial emergency response group (Refinery Terminal Fire Company - RTFC). In addition, over fifty trained emergency responders could be deployed with state-of-the-art emergency response equipment within an hour if necessary due to the Corpus Christi Port Industrial consortium. Another aspect of our emergency response capabilities is notification of our adjacent neighbors through the Crisis Management Dispatch (CMD), a computerized calling network capable of simultaneous calling to pre-determined calling zones, and Radio Broadcast FM 87.5.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nFHR operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from raw crude oil. The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc. Additionally, "

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP rule are also subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program. For process units containing threshold quantities (TQs) of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) per OSHA PSM, the programs summarized below are applied equally to EPA RMP covered and EPA RMP non-covered process units.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFHR's policy is to encourage employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention programs. Examples of employee participation included updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information, participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) teams and facilitating and participating in incident investigations. Employees have access to information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program. Additionally, the refinery has a number of processes that address process safety and accident prevention. These processes include teams such as the Central Environmental Health and Safety Council (CEHSC), Hazard Recognition Team (HRT), and the Refinery Process Safety Committee (RPSC). These teams contain members from across the refinery, including employees from operations, maintenance, engineering, as well as refinery management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFHR's policy is to maintain technical documents that are to be used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical proper"

The Records Department within the refinery is the primary repository for process safety information. FHR also makes certain process safety information available on the FHR Intranet.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for certain process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the unit operating procedures. The refinery maintains these parameters within defined limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nWithin the PHA program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and confirm that adequate controls are in place to manage potential hazards. FHR primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform the majority of the PHA evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as a systematic and thorough hazard evaluation technique. The analyses are conducted with a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience "

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  In addition, the team may request further review of some scenarios through the use of Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) in order to further evaluate the controls in place.\n\nThe PHA team findings are typically addressed by assigning action items to appropriate refinery personnel. Implementation of action items in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking is intended to help ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. PHA action items are tracked and maintained in the FHR Compliance Action Item Tracking System, LYNX. Within this system, an employee assigned an action is responsible for its execution by an assigned target date. Responsible employees are automatically reminded via email of their assigned action and upcoming due date. For delinquent action items supervisors are emailed notification of employee's outstanding action items and the supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, FHR's practice is to periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. The results and findings from base and revalidation PHAs are documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFHR's policy is to maintain written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, FHR's policy is to maintain upper and lower safe operating limits for process equipment in the Unit Operating Procedures and provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is available on the FHR Intranet and in the control room area.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, FHR's policy is to implement a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in refinery operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing the basic training, an operator in training is paired with a senior operator to learn process- specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, operators periodically receive refresher training to confirm that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nFHR uses contractors to supplement its workforce as part of routine practices or during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The MSQ is FHR's initial screening process for accepting a contract employer to work at the refinery and also used as an ongoing screening tool to renew and approve continued support from contract employers.\n\nBecause some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place designed to oversee that contractors:\n\n- perform work in a safe manner,\n\n- have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n\n- are aware of the hazards in their workplace,\n\n- understand what they should do in the event of an emergency,\n\n- understand and follow site safety rules, and\n\n- inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.\n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work permitting process prior to beginning work. In addition, FHR's practice is to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFHR's policy is to conduct a PSSR for a new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify aspects of readiness.

The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked and maintained in LYNX. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nFHR's policy is to periodically conduct audits to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every three-years or on an as needed basis to track compliance with PSM and RMP requirements. At minimum, an audit team composed of personnel knowledgeable in these requirements, auditing techniques and process unit technology conducts the comprehensive audit. The audit team develops findings that are documented in an audit report and the action items from the audit are placed in LYNX. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked in LYNX.
