To this end, we estimated that 4,542 pallets of Level 1 aerosols would all be as Raid Max Flying Insect Killer, and that 4,380 pallets of Level 2/3 aerosols would all be as Raid Max Concentrated Deep Reach Fogger. While such is expected to provide a conservative worst-case aggregate amount for applicability assessment purposes, such is not reasonable to expect in practice because at any given time, there will be more than one type of Level 1 aerosol product, and more than one type of Level 2/3 aerosol product onsite - each with varying amounts of flammable mixtures (expected to be less than or equal to that which is noted under Item 4, above). The relative mix of products at any given time depends on numerous variables (e.g., market demand, distribution needs). Regardless of the actual mix of products, the TQ is expected to be triggered."

There have been no accidents at the facility resulting in any offsite environmental impacts. \n\nEmergency response activities at the Country Club Hills Facility are coordinated with the Cook  County (Suburban) LEPC and the Country Club Hills Fire Department. The maximum number of pallets storing flammable mixture-containing products is conservatively based on the following as the best information available at the time the RMP was prepared:  \n\n1.\tThe maximum number of pallets of aerosol products is estimated at 8,922 pallets - the relative distribution of which includes up to 4,542 pallets of Level 1 aerosols, and 4,380 pallets of Level 2/3 aerosols\n2.\tThe number of cases per pallet is estimated at 205 cases per pallet, as a worst-case; however, the actual number of cases per pallet generally varies by product depending on packaging & transportations requirements. \n3.\tThe number of cans per case is estimated to be 12 cans/case. \n4.\tThe worst-case amount of propellant per can is estimated at 0.73 lb/can for Level 1 aerosols (as Raid Max Flying Insect Killer) and 0.74 lb/can for Level 2/3 aerosols (as Raid Max Concentrated Deep Reach Fogger). \n5.\tThe worst-case release assumes a full-case of 12-cans. \n6.\tThe flammable mixture mass reported in Sec. 1.17.c (16,151,244 lbs) is the total of the reportable flammable chemicals, while the total mass of the entire mixture is calculated at 19,185,550 lbs \n\nThe fourth item is expected to result in a refined approximation of the worst-case amount of flammable mixture in individual containers for use in calculating the worst case release scenario, given it is realistic to expect that when the above-noted Raid products are present onsite, there will be at least one case that may contribute to release. For continuity, this refinement was then conservatively extrapolated to estimate the max"

      "SummaryText": "Country Club Hills\n \nA Risk Management Plan has been implemented in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68 (40 CFR 68) for the Country Club Hills Regional Distribution Center (RDC) for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The facility is located at 16901 Cicero Avenue in Country Club Hills (Cook County), Illinois, and is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (SCJ).  SCJ is a privately held, family-managed company, with its worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin.  The facility was constructed in 2022 and started to receive products in Q1 of 2023.\n\nPropellants comprised of flammable mixtures subject to the above-cited federal regulation are in select aerosol-based consumer products stored and managed in association with the Country Club Hills RDC. Consumer products are stored inside the warehouse - for which Level 2 & 3 aerosols are stored in two designated aerosol rooms, while Level 1 aerosols may be stored throughout the warehouse.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in select aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under federal RMP regulations. Specifically, the propellants consist of blends of propane (CAS No. 74-98-6), butane (CAS No. 106-97-8) and isobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5). These are collectively regulated as a flammable mixture. The maximum projected quantities of aerosol products stored at the facility and product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage & handling processes. Although the size of each individual aerosol container is relatively small (typically 15 to 17.5 ounce cans), the number of such containers present onsite at any given time has the potential to exceed the corresponding 10,000 pound TQ. \n\nThe worst case scenario performed, based on EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis G"
