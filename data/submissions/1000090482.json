In connection with this separation and alignment process, the DuPont N&B assets at the Midland, MI site will be transferred effective on or around November 1, 2020.\r\n\r\nThese properties and asset changes occurred within Dow Michigan Operations to include RMP substances of Propylene oxide, Ethyl ether, Methyl ether, Methyl chloride, and Ethyl chloride.  As a result these process materials have been removed from the DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US LLC plan.  In addition, Methyl chloride maximum inventories for DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US LLC is reduced to below threshold limits.  These asset changes also decreased the maximum volume of inventories as well as changes to the reported release scenario analysis.            \r\n\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nDDP Specialty Electronic Materials US LLC. Site is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  Appropriate controls are implemented to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release were to occur, highly trained emergency response personnel are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  The facility also coordinates with th"
