Site.\n\n\n\n\n\nRevisions to the Plan\n\n\n\nRevisions to the October 30, 2019 plan are being submitted on October 20, 2020 to become effective on November 1, 2020 for the following reasons:\n\n\n\nMinor registration information changes to facility name from DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US Inc to DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US LLC. \n\n\n\nLegal entity, ownership properties and assets changes from DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US LLC to Nutrition and Bioscience (N&B) business.  In connection with this separation and alignment process, the DuPont N&B assets at the Midland, MI site will be transferred effective on or around November 1, 2020.\n\n\n\nThese properties and asset changes occurred within Dow Michigan Operations to include RMP substances of Propylene oxide, Ethyl ether, Methyl ether, Methyl chloride, and Ethyl chloride.  As a result these process materials have been removed from the DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US LLC plan.  In addition, Methyl chloride maximum inventories for DDP Specialty Electronic Materials US LLC is reduced to below threshold limits.
