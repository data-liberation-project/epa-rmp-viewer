      "SummaryText": "Paris Water Treatment Plant, located at 700 Scott Avenue, Paris, KY, has one independent chlorine injection system.  The chlorine storage is located indoors.  The chlorination process is located inside the chlorine process building.  The system has one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on-line and one (1) one-ton container of chlorine on standby at any one time.   The system is operated under vacuum using gaseous chlorine.  There is a Vacuum Regulator-Check Unit (Wallace & Tiernan 500 lb/24 hour capacity) which automatically shuts off the cylinder in the event of a break in the vacuum line.  The chlorine supply system can automatically switch between the on-line and standby chlorine containers when the on-line container is depleted.\n\nThe Facility has a chlorine detector to monitor leakage in the chlorine storage and chlorinator rooms.  Chlorine sensors are located at about twelve (12) inches above floor level in both rooms.  The detector will automatically alarm at the Facility and at the main control room panel.\n\nIn addition to the chlorine cylinders in use, the Facility normally stores a maximum of two (2) one-ton cylinders at the site at any one time.  All cylinders are stored indoors in a building with doors that seal.  During chlorine deliveries, the delivery truck backs up to the unloading area and the cylinders are taken off the truck via the Facility's crane and placed upon the dock.\n\nNormally, the chlorinator room is secured with doors that remain closed and locked except when the system is being inspected.  Inspection takes place daily.  If a chlorine leak is detected, the chlorine alarm will sound and the Operator will notify the Plant Supervisor and appoint a Standby Operator.  The Operator and Standby will don the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and the Operator will then investigate the cause for the alarm.  The exhaust fans will be activated from the exterior of the building.  The air inside the building is evacuated and fresh air is drawn i"

The Operator and the Standby are trained in chlorine safety and emergency procedures.  The Operator will shut the chlorine cylinder.  If the leakage is not stopped the Fire Department will be contacted and the exhaust fans shut down to try to contain the leak within the building.\n\nThe Facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine from this covered process in the five years prior to the submission of this Risk Management Plan (RMP)."
