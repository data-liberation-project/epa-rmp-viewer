Also included is a plan of action to be taken in the event of a chlorine release.  The plan of action includes instructions on how to respond to a leak in the chlorine system.  The plan also includes a floor plan of the Water Treatment Plant indicating the locations of the chlorine storage and feed rooms as well as a diagram of the chlorine storage and feed rooms.\n\nThe KWD Water Treatment Plant has a training program in place for the use of the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).  The facility has two SCBA's on-site along with a spare air tank for each SCBA.  Employees are trained in the use of the SCBA.  The facility has coordinated with the St. Clair County ESDA, New Athens Fire Department, and the New Athens LEPC by providing each agency with a copy of the Emergency Response Plan for the facility.  The KWD Water Treatment Plant also coordinates with the afore mentioned agencies to train employees and emergency responders in the plan of action required to respond to a chlorine leak.  The facility has a mock 1-ton chlorine container along with an emergency repair kit for the 1-ton container on-site for use in training and for the repair of a leaking chlorine cylinder.\n\nThe Kaskaskia Water District Water Treatment Plant is committed to providing a water treatment facility which can adequately serve it\u00bfs customers with safe drinking water as well as providing it's employees with safe working conditions.

      "SummaryText": "The following executive summary has been prepared for the Kaskaskia Water District Water Treatment Plant located in the City of New Athens, St. Clair County, Illinois.  The Kaskaskia Water District (KWD) has maintained stringent chemical safety policies and an updated Emergency Response Plan for the accidental release of chlorine from this facility.  The water treatment process includes chlorination to disinfect drinking water.  The chlorine system is a vacuum feed system which was changed from a pressure feed system in June 1993.  Chlorine leak detectors along with visible and audible alarms were also updated in 1993.  KWD is a Water Treatment Facility which provides potable water to a large number of customers in St. Clair County, Washington County, and Randolph County in Illinois.  KWD treats raw water pumped from the Kaskaskia River with various chemicals including chlorine, however, only chlorine exceeds the EPA RMP threshold quantity.  The maximum amount of chlorine present at this facility is 6,000 pounds, but the average quantity of chlorine on-site is 3,500 pounds.  \n\nThe KWD Water Treatment Plant is operated by an experienced work force who are knowledgeable of the chlorination process at the facility.  The chlorination system is visually inspected daily as a part of the Water Treatment Plant start-up procedure.The chlorination system includes process controls such as check valves and alarms which are designed to limit the release of chlorine in the event of an accident or equipment failure.  The detection systems in the chlorine storage and chlorine feed rooms are designed to trigger an audible and visual alarm within the plant to alert the employees.  The alarm is tested daily as part of the Water Treatment Plant start-up procedure.\n\nThe KWD Water Treatment Plant has not experienced an accidental release of chlorine within the last 10 years.  The absence of accidental releases is likely due to the daily inspection of the chlorination system and the preve"
