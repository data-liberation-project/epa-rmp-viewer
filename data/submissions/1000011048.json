To demonstrate these values substantial resources have been invested into the refinery in accident prevention.  It is our policy to include accident prevention in every part of our business, design, operations, and maintenance systems.  However, if a release should occur, substantial resources (trained response personnel and equipment) will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lemont Refinery operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammable products, such as propane and butane.  In addition, the refinery uses Hydrogen Fluoride to produce consumer hydrocarbon products.  In the past, Lemont Refinery used Anhydrous Ammonia but currently a 19% Aqueous Ammonia solution is being used in an effort to reduce the possible hazardous effects of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5 - Year Accident History\n\nWhile minor releases of regulated chemicals have occurred, in the last 5 years no release was large enough to have an offsite impact. The CITGO Lemont Refinery has had one reportable incident in the last 5 years, due to employee/contractor injury.   \n\nOn Monday, October 2, 2006, while in the process of clearing piping to and from a pump (during the turnaround of the refineryA?s alkylation unit), operators opened suction and discharge valves to the pump in order to allow liquid and vapor to flow to the pump-out.  A seal flush pipe had been disconnected from the pump and a flow path to atmosphere was created without the pipe being blocked in.  The release lasted for 1 minute and approximately 186 lbs of a HF Alkylation Recycle Isobutane stream (mixture"

After the incident, there were 5 other contract employees who received medical treatment off site.  CITGO Lemont Refinery could not confirm that any of these contractors suffered actual injury or that the medical treatment was other than precautionary.  We could also not confirm whether these alleged injuries were the result of HF exposure.  However, according to RMP reporting requirements, 7 A?injuriesA? have been recorded in the RMP submission but Lemont Refinery has only been able to authenticate that 2 of the recorded 7 injuries were a result of this release. \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Lemont Refinery has established teams for each of the RMP accident prevention practices.  These teams are responsible for understanding regulatory requirements, identifying gaps in the program and develop and implement plans to close gaps and enhance program. The accident prevention practices are summarized in the following paragraphs.  \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Refinery has a written plan to encourage employee participation in its prevention program.  Employees give input into the program in many different ways; some of these include: Process Hazard Analysis participation, Member of Accident Investigations, reviewing Operating Procedures, developing Unit Specific Training requirements, Safe Practice Standard Committee Membership, Safety Awareness Committee, etc.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe foundation for safe plant operations is the knowledge of how it is designed, and how it should operate.  This knowledge must provide for identifying and understanding the hazards of the chemicals and processes of the plant.  It is required that this knowledge be documented. Process Safety Information comprises three categories:\nA? Hazards of materials\nA? Technical information\nA? Equipment design information\nThis information is kept evergreen and made"

These analyses identify and evaluate the operational hazards, and analyze what protective measures are in place to control them.  From these analyses, it is then determined if additional actions can be taken to improve the safety of the process. The Hazard Analysis Team then makes recommendations to improve the process. The recommendations are reviewed by Management and scheduled for implementation or further study.  A management system is in place to ensure the recommendations are dealt with in a timely manner.  Employees are informed about what actions are taken to resolve the findings and recommendations of the studies.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures that clearly and completely describe how to safely start-up, operate, temporary operate, and shut-down are maintained.  These procedures address the steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.  Operating procedures undergo a review and approval process before being made effective.  All effective operating procedures are certified as current and accurate on an annual basis.\n\nTraining\n\nOperators are trained in the specific procedures required to operate their process unit. Refresher training is required every three (3) years.  The Refinery ensures and documents that the training has been received and understood by the employee.  Records documenting both the performance and effectiveness of the training are maintained.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Refinery considers contractors' safety programs and performance when hiring them.  Contractors are informed about the hazards, safety requirements and emergency action plans.  Contractor employees are required to know how to do the job safely.  Contractor employers are required to ensure that the plant's safety rules are being followed.  The r"

A Contractor Safety Committee has been established to review safety issues and discuss performance at Lemont Refinery.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews \n\nThe Refinery performs a Pre-Startup Safety Review(PSSR) for new facilities and/or modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  This element of the program closely tied to the Management of Change program and is an integral part of authorizing start up of physical changes.\nThe PSSR confirms that:  \nA? Construction and equipment meet design specifications; \nA? All procedures are in place; \nA? A safety review has been completed and all recommendations have been resolved or implemented; and\nA? Training has been completed.  \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Refinery maintains plant equipment in good operating condition.  In addition to repair, the plant has a Preventive Maintenance schedule for tests and inspections, conduct those tests and inspections, and repair any deficiencies that are found.  The Preventive Maintenance Program follows manufacturers' recommendations, or good engineering practices.\nThe refinery Mechanical Integrity Program ensures that any new equipment meets design requirements and was installed properly before it is placed in service.  The refinery also ensures that spare parts and other maintenance materials are the correct ones for the job.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Refinery has many safe work practices that govern many aspects of operations and maintenance of the facility. These practices are designed to ensure that all work in the refinery is completed safety. Examples include the refinery's general Safety Manual, Safe Work Permits, Hazardous Energy Control, Hot Work Procedure, Confined Space Entry, Fall Protection, Respiratory Protection, etc. and many more.

The procedure requires a technical and safety review, making needed operating procedure changes, and a management authorization for the changes.  When changes are made, all effected employees are to be trained in or informed of the change, and equipment information and other process safety information is updated to document the change.  \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nWhenever an incident or accident occurs that caused, or might have resulted in a release of toxic/flammable material, fire or explosion, environmental loss, or personal injury, it is promptly investigated.  The objective of the investigation is to determine the root cause(s) that lead to the incident and take appropriate action to prevent their reoccurrence.\nThe Refinery uses a team investigation approach includes 2-6 people from many related disciplines that ensures that best technical recommendations are taken.\nManagement systems are in place to ensure that recommendations are reviewed by management and promptly implemented.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nThe Refinery performs an audit every three (3) years to ensure compliance with all elements of the OSHA PSM Standard and EPA Risk Management Program.  This audit is preformed by an outside entity (Corporate or Contractor). If non-compliance is discovered, then any deficiencies in procedures and/or practices are corrected.  \nIn addition to regulatory required audits, refinery management is constantly reviewing and testing all PSM programs and Safety Practices to ensure that they are followed and in good standing.
