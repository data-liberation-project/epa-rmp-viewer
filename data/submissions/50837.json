The owners, management and employees of \n   AgriServices are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release   \n   should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department , county LEPC, EPA and all other authorities to\n   mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n    The primary activity at the Archbold AgriServices facility is the handling, storage, application, shipping and receiving of \n    agricultural fertilizers (liquid and granular), pesticides and miscellaneous farm supplies. The only RMP regulated material at\n    this facility is anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is received by truck, stored, filled into nurse tanks and sold to\n    farmers for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The facility stores ammonia in two tanks - 18,000 gallons and \n    12,000 gallons. When filled to 85% capacity, these tanks can hold a total of 131,325 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3.  Accidental release prevention program:\n     This facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, \n     K-61.1 published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR 1910.000, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\n4.  The 5 Year Accident History:\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries,\n     or significant property damage at the facility. Neither have there been a release that, to our knowledge, resulted in offsite \n     deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n\n5.
