Process equipment examined by these inspections includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, heat exchangers, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Process equipment that are in contact with the hazardous RMP-listed chemicals receive priority for inspections. Maintenance functions are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance inspections are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Rhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Proposed changes are implemented after they have been justified and reviewed for potential hazards that are addressed prior to implementing the change.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of the change and why it is necessary, and offered training to understand and work with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to significant modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Rhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility.  The extent of review is based on the complexity of the modification.  These reviews are conducted by a cross-functional team to confirm that construction, equipment, instrumentation, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nRhodia, Inc., Baton Rouge Facility conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the "
