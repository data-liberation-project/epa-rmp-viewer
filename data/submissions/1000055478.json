This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated processes. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with this facilityA?s contracted emergency action team, local Fire Department, and the Franklin County Emergency Management Agency for emergency action support.\n\n\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nFood Lion-Distribution Center # 7 is a dry and cold storage distribution facility.  The facility is primarily responsible is for storage, processing and re-sourcing Food Lion grocery stores. The facility is located in the rural area of the city of Greencastle, Pennsylvania.  \n\n\n\nThe substance regulated under the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) that is located on site is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia  (Anhydrous) is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility in a threshold quantity and is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The systemA?s purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for our product. Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe Center has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.

The facility maintains a written Emergency Action Plan to document specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia release. The Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for facility evacuation, as well as for notification to the local emergency action agencies, which are responsible for notifying the public. The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\nFood Lion has devised a comprehensive emergency action program, designed to protect both employees and the community in the event of a release. This program is fully described in a document entitled EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN (EAP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site anhydrous ammonia release.  Included in the plan are measures to be taken internally by Food Lion as well as measures to be taken by off-site response agencies.  \n\n\n\nFood Lion on-site personnel will respond only to minor incidental ammonia releases.  Trained off-site responders will handle all non-incidental and major releases.\n\n\n\nTo assure that local governmental response agencies are familiar with the Food Lion, Greencastle, Pennsylvania emergency action procedures, Food Lion has provided copies of the ERP for review and approval by the local agencies. \n\n\n\nTo plan for an ammonia release with off-site effects, Food Lion EAP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, transportation maps for response agencies, evacuation route m"
