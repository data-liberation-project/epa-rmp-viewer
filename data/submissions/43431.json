Okmetic currently employees about 40 persons at this facility.  The Company is committed to providing the highest quality semiconductors to industry while maintaining the highest standards of safety for employees and the public.  This document covers the Hydrogen Chloride (HCL) and Trichlorosilane (TCS) bulk supply and distribution systems that feeds the manufacturing processes used to manufacture epitaxial silicon wafers.  \n\nProcess Description\n\nSilicon wafers are produced by depositing a thin single layer of crystal silicon on a silicon disc (wafer) to produce a substrate used in manufacturing semiconductor products, commonly called chips.  HCL and TCS are used in this process.  TCS is the source of silicon for the deposition.  The deposition takes place in an epitaxial reactor operated at elevated temperatures.  The temperature is high enough to separate the silicon and chlorine atoms contained in the Trichlorosilane.  Hydrogen chloride is used to remove silicon deposits on equipment piece parts during the reaction.  Hydrogen chloride is also a major by-product of the deposition process.  HCL emissions are controlled in accordance with applicable state and federal air regulations.  The facility has obtained a permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for the emissions from the process.\n\nRegulated Chemicals\n\nHydrogen Chloride (HCL) is a highly corrosive gas that will quickly combine with water vapor in the air to form Hydrochloric Acid.  The acid will quickly react and form less harmful chloride salts and water in the environment.  The above reactions occur quickly in the environment thus the reactive effects of a release will end shortly (within minutes to a few hours) of the time when the release stops.  The system consists of a bulk stora"

The maximum inventory of HCL on site is 22,200 pounds.  \n\nHCL gas is withdrawn from the storage tanks through a series of regulators and automatic valves equipped with monitors, alarms, and automatic shutdowns that vent to gas scrubbers should there be any leaks.  Additionally, HCL gas is only withdrawn from the storage tanks as it is used.  This minimizes the amount of gas that would be released from using the system.  The pressure of the gas in the distribution system is kept relatively low to reduce the potential for leaks in the distribution system.  The distribution system is constructed using corrosion resistant Hastelloy steel, with welded connections where possible, valve enclosures vented through scrubbers, purge systems vented through scrubbers, alarms with automatic shutdowns, manual shutdowns, and employee training.  \n\nTrichlorosilane (TCS) is a colorless volatile liquid that is corrosive and extremely flammable.  TCS reacts with water to form corrosive compounds and may ignite on contact with water or air.\n\nThe TCS system consists of a bulk liquid supply and distribution piping and equipment.  Liquid transfer is accomplished by pressurizing the bulk storage container vapor space with inert gas (argon).  The increased pressure forces the TCS into the distribution piping via a dip tube installed in the vessel.  When the active container is depleted, the system automatically switches to an alternate supply, typically a 55-gallon secondary supply source located in the distribution system cabinet, and warns the operator that the empty bulk container needs to be exchanged.  \n\nTCS is received at the facility in a cargo transport vessel.  It remains in the transport vessel at the facility.  No bulk liquid transfer is conducted at the facility.  Empty cargo containers are exchanged, as needed.  During container change out, the system piping and electrical controls function to first clear the lines of residual TCS to all"

The operator works in conjunction with the microprocessor program to accomplish these tasks.  Trained representatives from the product supplier conduct these operations.\n\nLiquid from the supply vessel is routed through a manifold system to the process.  At the use points, the TCS is contacted with a carrier gas, typically Hydrogen, to provide vapor phase feed to a reaction chamber. Maximum intended inventory at the facility is 43,000 lbs, or one cargo vessel.\n\nAccident Prevention Programs\n\nOkmetic and the product supplier have developed and implemented Process Safety Management Programs in accordance with OSHA standards for Hydrogen Chloride and Trichlorosilane in order to eliminate or minimize releases from the facility.  The facility has also developed and implemented procedures for safe work practices including control of hazardous energy.\n\nThe supplier of both distribution systems has incorporated safety provisions that include numerous alarms, automatic shutdowns, and employee procedures designed to insure that the HCL and TCS is safely stored and used in the process.  All system components are designed in accordance with the applicable guidelines and recommendations of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and other appropriate industry standards for compressed gases and semiconductor facilities.  Okmetic, Inc. is committed to immediate response and full cooperation with the authorities in the event of any kind of emergency situation at the facility.\n\nBoth TCS and HCL bulk delivery systems are equipped with detection sensors connected to a site wide Toxic Gas Monitoring system with shutdown capabilities in the event of a leak.

Any loss of exhaust detected at any gas cabinet or reactor will result in shutdown of the source gas.  Ballards are in place at both bulk delivery areas to prevent damage due to vehicular traffic.\n\nThe company has taken every reasonable precaution to insure that any release is small.  The bulk storage vessels for HCL and TCS are protected DOT approved shipping containers.  They represent a very low risk of releasing a regulated substance.  \n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APCI) is the supplier of the HCL and TCS products, bulk storage and distribution systems.  A written agreement exists between Okmetic and APCI stating ownership of equipment as well as ownership of the regulated chemicals.  With this type of agreement both Okmetic and APCI employees are involved in all chemical supply change outs and associated work.  This insures procedures developed by APCI and Okmetic are reviewed by both parties and a best possible procedure is used.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nOkmetic has developed an Emergency Action Plan to be implemented in the event of an emergency release of a regulated substance.  This plan also provides employees and responding agencies with procedures to be followed in the event of a fire, explosion, inclement weather event, civil disturbance, or medical emergency.  Facility personnel have been designated in the Emergency Action Plan to act as emergency coordinators, evacuation coordinators, and program administrators.  The plan describes alarm systems, evacuation routes, procedures to take in the event of an emergency, contact numbers, and incident closeout procedures.

Regular employee safety meetings, design reviews, and the Process Hazard Analysis sessions are used to identify and implement improved safety procedures."
