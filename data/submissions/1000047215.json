Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe Williams Water Treatment Plant (Williams Plant) is part of Water Utilities a division of the City of Lakeland, Florida. The City of Lakeland requires each site to develop and maintain accident prevention programs and an emergency response plan appropriate to the site.  Each site is also responsible for regulatory compliance issues that apply to the site.  The City of Lakeland Office of Risk Management provides assistance in training for site employees and in budgeting and procurement of safety and training.\n\n\n\n2. Description of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe Williams Plant is located at 1501 Kendrick Lane in the northwest corner of Lakeland, Florida. The plant consists of filtration, clarification, fluoridation and purification processes that treat drinking water for the City of Lakeland. \n\n\n\nThe Williams Plant adds chlorine to the filtered water as a purification agent. The chlorination process is located in an enclosed building at the southeast corner of the property, where liquefied chlorine gas is stored in up to twenty one-ton containers.  Eight containers are always connected to the chlorination system, and up to twelve are stored nearby.  The total chlorine inventory in the process at any one time ranges from 16,000 to 40,000 lbs.  This exceeds the 2,500-lb. RMP threshold quantity.\n\n\n\n3. General Accidental Release and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe City of Lakeland considers its processes as subject to PSM and has implemented a PSM program at all facilities which have PSM listed processes.  For RMP compliance purposes, this places the Williams Plant process in the Program 3 level.  The Williams facility will use their PSM programs as the required RMP Program 3 Prevention Program.\n\n\n\nThe Williams Plant has a program in place to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, 29 CFR 1919.119.  The PSM "

      "SummaryText": "Program was established in 1997 for the chlorine process.  The program includes written operating procedures, preventative maintenance, and employee training to ensure safe operation of the chlorine process. The PSM Programs of each facility receive full support of plant management and involvement of employees at all levels.\n\n\n\nThe chlorination process is located in an enclosed building that includes a scrubber capable of filtering up to one ton and by process-area chlorine detectors which will set off alarms if a release of chlorine is detected.\n\n\n\n4. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThe Williams Plant has had no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs with the Prevention Program, the Williams Plant has an Emergency Response Program in place.  The program complies with 29 CFR 1910.38. The current plans have been coordinated with the Polk County Fire Department and Hazardous Materials Response Team, and the District 7 Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Notification is made locally by dialing 911, and by notifying Florida State Warning Point at (800) 320-0519 or (904) 413-9911.\n\n\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe Williams Plant will implement recommendations from the recent PHA."
