Applicable procedures of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are followed . The facility's emergency policy involves the preparation of plans tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\nThe facility spill prevention policy seeks to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated flammable substances. In the event such a release occurs facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe North Douglas gas plant, located in rural Rio Blanco County, Colorado, operates processes to recover petroleum products ( e.g. natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) from field gas. The NGL separated from the field gas is stored on site and is sold to others for further processing.  NGL is a flammable mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons including regulated flammables methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, isopentane and pentane. There are no threshold quantities of toxic substances present. \nThis facility was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations.\n\nWORSE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nThe worse case scenario (WCS) at this Program 1 stationary source is the release of the maximum content of the largest storage tank, which forms a flammable vapor cloud and the cloud detonates. For flammable substances the end point is an overpressure of 1 psi. The endpoint distance, determined by EPA's RMP Comp., indicates that this facility does not have an offsite public receptor.

This summary addresses the OSHA PSM elements and the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \nThis facility was designed and constructed in accord with applicable state and federal regulations.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployees are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nA variety of technical documents are kept at the gas plant and used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature,"

The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe gas plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as evaluating proposed changes to ensure\nthat safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined \nto identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe What If analysis technique is primarily used to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are \nconducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are sent to local and division management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is guided by a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  All approved mitigation actions in response to PHA team findings are tracked until completed.  \nThe final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety fe"

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted \nat this frequency until the process is no longer operating.   The team findings and recommendations are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept \ncurrent and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management \nof change process.  These procedures are readily available in the process unit for operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the gas plant has a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

This training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, procedures are \nin place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow plant safety rules, and (6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices before their beginning work.  In addition, the gas plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Gas plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or process modification that requires a change \nin the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  \n\nThe PSSR team may use a checklist(s) to verify startup readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly imple"

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) scheduled preventive maintenance, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nPersonnel who perform maintenance are trained on an overview of the process, safety and health hazards, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plan and applicable safe work \npractices to help ensure that jobs are performed in a safe manner. Scheduled preventive maintenance helps ensure that work is performed in a timely and consistent manner. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or plant management will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nQuality assurance is also integral part of the mechanical integrity program.  The gas plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe gas plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure \nto ensure isolation of energy sources for eq"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized \nbefore being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, personnel that perform operating / maintenance tasks are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAll incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury are promptly investigated. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.
