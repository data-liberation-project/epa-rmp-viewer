      "SummaryText": "The U.S. Field Artillery Center and Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, uses chlorine gas as a disinfectant at the installation wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Sulfur dioxide gas is also used to dechlorinate the wastewater flow prior to discharge.  The concentrated forms of these agents, before being mixed with water, can be extremely hazardous if a sudden release of the vessel contents occur.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are carefully stored and handled to prevent their accidental release.  This Risk Management / Process Safety Manangement Plan (RMP/PSM) describes the chemical hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas and explains what Fort Sill is doing to prevent an accidental release.  This plan has been developed and implemented in accordance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Provisions regulations (40 CFR 68) and guidelines.\n\nThe Fort Sill WWTP currently has one stationary source subject to EPA RMP regulations: the WWTP source area (Building 5933). The WWTP source area (Building 5933) consists of a chlorinator that introduces chlorine gas into treated wastewater for disinfection.  As many as five 1-ton cylinders can be stored on trunnions within the enclosure of Building 5933.  The Fort Sill WWTP treats an estimated 2.0 million gallons of wastewater each day, and uses an average of 80 pounds of chlorine gas daily with a maiximum of 100 pounds.  The storage room is equipped with a ventilation system that, under normal operations, circulates fresh air throughout the building to maintain a moderate room temperature.  A chlorine detector monitors the air within the building for chlorine gas.  In the event that the concentration of chlorine gas exceeds 3 parts per million (ppm), the ventilation system is automatically shut down and sealed to mitigate the rate of release from the building.\n\nChlorine is the only RMP regulated substance at the Fort Sill WWTP (Building 5933) that is stored in quantities above the applicabl"

The WWTP source area (Building 5933) consists of a sulfonator that introduces sulfur dioxide gas into treated wastewater for dechlorination.  As many as two 1-ton cylinders can be stored on trunnions within the enclosure of Building 5933. The quantity of sulfur dioxide stored onsite does not exceed the threshold to require RMP compliance.  The Fort Sill WWTP treats an estimated 2.0 million gallons of wastewater each day.

Based on the results of the worst-case release scenario consequence analysis, the 5-year accident history, and the applicability of the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the Fort Sill WWTP must meet RMP Program 3 Prevention Program requirements for RMP-regulated processes.
