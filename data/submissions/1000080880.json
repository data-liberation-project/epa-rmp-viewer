There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent Five-Year history period.\n\n\n\nThe Process Safety Management (PSM) program that was initiated in 1995 has been maintained current for the past twenty four (24) years. The OSHA mandated PSM compliance per 29 CFR 1910.119 also demonstrates our compliance with the Risk Management Program (RMP). A Prevention Program Site specific RMP/PSM Implementation Manual issued to the Water and Wastewater Plants are used to manage our compliance program. Key activities have included: \n\n\n\no    An annual review of  all chlorine, PSM and RMP procedures\n\no    A minimum of at least a three year refresher training \n\no    Process Hazards Analysis using the HAZOP / Revalidation Template and Hazard Review Leader Software most recently conducted in June 2019\n\no    Self Audits conducted at a minimum of every three years\n\no    A comprehensive Mechanical Integrity program that uses a computer-based maintenance scheduling program\n\no    An annual review and update of the Emergency Response Plan including periodic drills.\n\n             \n\nA PSM committee consisting of supervisors, chief operators and plant operators meets several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with the requirements of the RMP/PSM regulation.\n\n\n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plants have implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine.\n\n\n\n1) The chlorine delivery systems at the plants were upgraded to vacuum processes. The chlorinator system is part of a preventive maintenance program and greatly reduces the risks associated with pressurized chlorine lines.\n\n\n\n2) Automatic cylinder valve controls were installed on chlorine containers to isolate the c"

These scrubbers will capture and neutralize any released chlorine gas rendering it harmless. In addition to Process Safety Management, the organization has an active safety program. The City of Burlington Utility Department has had an active Safety Committee for twenty years. The committee meets monthly with representatives from each function and each site.  The committee's duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications. \n\n\n\nWithin the Utilities department, there are periodic safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n\n\n    - Hazard Communications (HAZCOM GHS update)\n\n\n\n    - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n\n\n\n    - Lockout/Tagout (LOTO)\n\n\n\n    - Confined Space\n\n\n\nAs a result of our programs, the Utility Department has had a strong safety record with no hazardous material related loss-time accidents over the past three years. We plan to continue our emphasis on safety to maintain and improve our safety performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nReport by:    \n\n                                                               \n\nEric Davis, Water & Sewer Operations Manager\n\nCity of Burlington"
