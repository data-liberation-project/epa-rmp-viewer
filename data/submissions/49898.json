The facility is located at 130 Crossgate Road, Port Wentworth, GA, 31407. The resin facility consists of a plant that was originally constructed in 1974.  Overall, the facility employs 40 full-time employees.\n\nGP is committed to operating the plant in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public, and the environment.  As part of this commitment, GP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMP Plan) describing the risk management program at the plant. This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the plant.\n\nThe risk management program at the plant consists of the following three elements:\n\n?A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances).\n\n?A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes).\n\n?An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\n\nInform"

In fact, the plant has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\n\n\nGP limits the use of hazardous substances.  Before using a hazardous substance at the plant, less hazardous alternatives are considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, GP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect plant workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\n\nGP prevents releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.  When a hazardous substance is used at the plant, the equipment is carefully designed, built and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction, and operation of the equipment. \n\nGP limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs.  GP trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs.  In addition, GP works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at the plant consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule. This RMP Plan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the plant that are required by the RMP rule.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nGP is committed to the safety of workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substa"

These controls include training programs for personnel, programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes at the plant; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the plant.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent injury to the public and the environment.  GP provides response training to its personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, GP established a management system headed by the Production Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\nRegulated Substances\nThe plant only handles Formaldehyde solution in sufficient quantity to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program Level 3 processes at the plant.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:  The OCA was conducted in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 68, Subpart B.  The OCA is summarized in Section 2-5 of the RMP Registration.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nSince 1992, the plant has used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Beginning in 1992, the plant formalized this prevention program for the formaldehyde storage process to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA process safety management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements:\n\nProgram 3?Essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment\n\nProgram 2?Requires simplified versions of 7 of the 12 elements of the Program 3 prevention program (not applicable for"

These documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances handled at the plant, (2) operating parameters of the equipment used at the plant, and (3) design basis and configuration of the equipment at the plant.  GP provides the necessary process safety information to our Production and Maintenance personnel.  This information is also available to emergency personnel such as the LEPC, Savannah Fire Department, Port Wentworth Volunteer Fire Department as needed.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical properties of the hazardous materials handled at the plant, including regulated substances in covered processes.  The information available for each hazardous substance typically includes:\n\n?Toxicity information and permissible exposure limits\n?Physical data (e.g., boiling point, melting point, flash point)\n?Reactivity and corrosivity data\n?Thermal and chemical stability data \n?Hazards of mixing substances in the process \n\nMSDSs for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the quality control room (raw material MSDS?s) and in the Traffic Supervisor?s office (product MSDS?s) so that the operators have ready reference to this information.  In addition, a list of MSDSs is provided to the LEPC and the fire department for use in helping formulate emergency response plans.\n\n\nThe engineering design documents include the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process.

Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are used to (l) train employees, (2) perform process hazards analyses, and (3) help maintain the equipment.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Plant performs and updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) at least every five years unless there are significant changes in the process safety information of the covered processes.  These PHAs help to identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The plant primarily uses the ?what-if checklist? technique to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to unit personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented. Quarterly reports are issued to track progress of PHA findings/recommendations.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nPlant -, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how"
