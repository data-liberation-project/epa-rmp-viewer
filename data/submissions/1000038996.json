Los Angeles County Department of Public Works has developed a risk management program to address the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements (California Health & Safety Code, Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, Sections 2735-2785). Los Angeles County Department of Public Works is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Los Angeles County Department of Public Works staff is trained and utilizes equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using chlorine. \r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICIES\r\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Works has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training, reputable contractors, and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination Disinfection Process. Los Angeles County Department of Public Works policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThis Los Angeles Department of Public Works facility uses chlorine and accompanying equipment for water treatment. Although chlorine is toxic at high levels, the concentrations used in disinfecting drinking water are low enough not to pose any risks to human health. \r\n\r\nLiquid chlorine is delivered to the facility in a one-ton container. The one-ton container is transferred to the Chlorine ChlorTainer area by a trolley monorail system. The connected chlorine container is within a ChlorTainer containment vess"

      "FacilityID": 1000038996,
      "SummaryText": "el. The container is connected by a yoke and adapter with new lead gaskets within the ChlorTainer. Chlorine gas under pressure flows from the online container through a vacuum regulator that is directly connected to each ChlorTainer. The vacuum regulator reduces the chlorine pressure to a vacuum. The chlorine gas is suctioned out of the container using vacuum pressure generated by a flow of pumped water. No chlorine piping or tubing is under pressure outside the ChlorTainer. One gaseous chlorinator is installed adjacent to the ChlorTainer. The chlorinator meters and injects gaseous chlorine into the raw water supply as it enters the Water Distribution pipeline. Chlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. Chlorine leak detection and warning is provided by an immediate visual detection system. Special paint is applied near possible leak areas that turns from golden yellow to red when gas with a pH of 3 or less is present.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: Per the CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined for each covered process.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment report, which is included as part of the CalARP 5 Year Update documentation. \r\n \r\nAlternative Release Scenarios Results Summary\r\nScenario Description: One alternative case release scenario was modeled.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment, which is included as part of the CalARP 5 Year Update documentation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\r\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the worst-case release scenario can potentially reach the community, Los Angeles County Department of Public Works has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst-case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices"

The vessel is tamper proof and in the event of a release, would contain the contents of the chlorine preventing a release to atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nAs part of the implementation of this CalARP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed; this includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  The Prevention Program 3 elements include:\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures\r\n\u00bf\tTraining\r\n\u00bf\tMechanical Integrity\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change\r\n\u00bf\tPre-Startup Safety Review\r\n\u00bf\tCompliance Audits\r\n\u00bf\tIncident Investigation\r\n\u00bf\tEmployee Participation\r\n\u00bf\tHot Work Permit\r\n\u00bf\tContractors\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no chlorine releases within the last five years.  \r\n \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \r\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Works has filed a Unified Contingency Plan"

A test startup was performed with the contractor and personnel from Los Angeles County Department of Public Works in June 2008.  Furthermore, the well site is inspected by plant personnel several times a week."
