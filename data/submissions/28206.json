This is a serious commitment and in order to achieve it, everyone must share the responsibility.\n\nThe personal safety of each associate is our FIRST concern and highest priority!\n\nManagement at all levels has the responsibility for the safety of the departments they manage.  This includes people, equipment and facilities that are placed under their control.  This responsibility includes development and follow-up of programs and procedures in order to ensure that safe working conditions and practices exist, and, that all safety regulations are met or exceeded.\n\nIn addition, all associates have a shared responsibility to this safety commitment by following safety rules, programs and procedures, approaching their work with a safe positive attitude and using safe work practices that will protect all associates, equipment and facilities.\n\nAssociates must report any unsafe or hazardous conditions to their supervisor immediately.  Utilization of the required safety equipment and the promotion of safe work practices is accomplished by setting the example and following these procedures on a daily basis.\n\nCommitment to this policy will enable us to work together as a team, in an effort to provide a safe work environment for all U.S. Foodservice associates.\n\nU.S. Foodservice continues to regard associates as its most important asset.  Therefore U.S. Foodservice is committed to providing a safe work environment for all of its associates.  We will accomplish this commitment by dedication to our ongoing safety awareness program.  Adherence from all associates to safety procedures and management's commitment to provide the necessary resources to create and maintain a safe workplace environment is critical to an effective safety program.\n\nU.S.  Foodservice further endorses the empowerment of"

Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nB.Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe U.S. Foodservice, Allentown, Pennsylvania, facility is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of food products.  Product is stored in frozen, refrigerated, or dry storage warehouse and then loaded and distributed by tractor trailer to various customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  This facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system toities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in this system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The ammonia inventory of this system is approximately 9,640 lbs.  Since ammonia releases from this system could pose a risk of offsite public impact and is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPAS rm PROGRAM.\n\nThe closed loop ammonia refrigeration system at the facility provides (2) major suction pressures (temperatures) for use in the preservation and processing of perishable food products.  Through the use of two stage compression the refrigeration system provides refrigerant temperatures of -25f. AND +20F.\n\nThe higher pressure portions of the system incl"

Normal safeties include: high pressure cut-outs, relief valves, and ventilating systems for machine room areas.\n\nC.Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative  Release Scenarios\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario is determined to be a catastrophic release from the V-1 High Pressure Receiver.  This vessel contains 5,199 pounds of ammonia.\n\nAssumed is that the release occurs through a .54-inch diameter circular hole located at the bottom of the vessel.  For this Worst Case Release Scenario, the distance from source to toxic endpoint is .87 miles.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\nThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are uncommon;\n\nIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these vessels;\n\nAmmonia is not corrosive in this service\n\nPressure safety valves limit operating pressures in these vessels and vessels have design margins of safety of about 4 to 1.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Analysis\n\nAn Alternative Release Scenario is chosen as a pipe failure.  The potential for a pipe failure is possible given the extensive ammonia piping system extending throughout the Facility and, as such, represents a more realistic event than the catastrophic failure of a vessel.\n\nAssumed is the failure of a 1-inch pipe connected to the V-1 receiver or a 2-inch pipe connected to the V-2 vessel.  Using EPA-suggested meteorological parameters for alternative scenarios and following a one-hour release, the distance from release point to the toxic endpoint is .14 mile.  \n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is unlikely for the following reasons\n\nThe high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release;\n\nIndustry standards were fo"
