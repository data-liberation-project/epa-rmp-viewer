The facility is located at 975 South Caron Road, Rochelle, IL. 61068.The SIC code for the operation is 4222 the NAICS code is 49312.  The facility has approximately 110 full time employees and operates 24 hours/day, 6 days/week, 52 weeks/year.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep food products fresh.  40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds or greater.  \n\n\n\nThe current capacity of the system exceeds 10,000 pounds. The facility has never experienced a significant release incident.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  The refrigeration system is designed, installed and operated in accordance with the applicable guidelines and standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE).  \n\n\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The RMP/PSM program are reviewed annually and updated as ne"

All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan.\n\n\n\nThe system is monitored and inspected by technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facility's PSM program.  The system is controlled automatically and monitored by the Global Refrigeration Computer Control System for proper operation 24 hours per day.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities in a computer base maintenance management program (AMMS). Walking inspections are conducted on intervals not longer than 8 hours per day when staffed.\n\n\n\nThe system is equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system can't be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with a shutdown system that is triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine room.  The system shutdown can be manually operated using an emergency stop switch located outside the engine room, in the adjacent room and from a remote system computer.\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the Rochelle Fire Department to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident evacuation drills.  The facility has never experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place.  Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia in the event they should occur.\n\n\n\n \n\nRyder Integrated Logistics Rochelle 1 has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Count"

Ryder Integrated Logistics Rochelle 1 files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the Ogle County LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.  The facility's Emergency Action Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  A release of 100 pounds or more during a 24 hour period must be reported to the National Response Center, the SERC, and LEPC, in accordance with section 304 of EPCRA.  The Rochelle City Fire Department has been provided with a copy of the facility's Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\n \n\n1.0    INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThis plan is prepared to document the preparation of a Risk Management Plan for the ammonia system operated by Ryder and owned by Ryder Integrated Logistics Rochelle 1 at their facility located 975 South Caron Rd. Rochelle, IL. 61068 The elements contained are to satisfy the requirements stated in 40 CFR 68 for a program 3 system.  \n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Facility Manager has overall responsibility for implementation of the Risk Management Plan.  He shall designate personnel, as he deems appropriate, to be responsible for specific elements of the plan.  Appendix A contains the identity of the Facility Manager and the individuals responsible for each element of the plan.  This list will be updated as necessary when personnel changes occur at the facility or the plan is updated.\n\n\n\n3.0    OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis required by the Risk Management Program identifies the distance a released chemical travels until it reaches its toxic endpoint.  Toxic Endpoint is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an ind"

The Toxic Endpoint for anhydrous ammonia is listed in 40 CFR 68, Appendix A as 0.14 mg/l or 200 ppm.\n\n\n\n3.1    Worst Case Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst case scenario is based upon the maximum amount of ammonia to be collected into the largest single vessel in the system.  Overall Intended System Inventory capacity is approximately 30,000 lbs. of ammonia as noted in the PSI information of the PSM Program. The system has five storage vessels, (V-1) high temperature receiver vessel, (V-2) High temperature recirculator vessel and three low temperature recirculator vessels (V-3), (V-4), & (V-5), two thermosyphon vessels (V-6) & (V-7).  The largest single vessel in the facility's system is the Low Temperature recirculator vessel (V-4).  In the case of a system pumpdown, ammonia will be transferred to the low temperature recirculator vessels (V-3), (V-4), & (V-5). The capacity of the low temperature recirculator vessel (V-4) at 100% is approximately 12400 lbs as the Worst Case ammonia quantity.  The design of V-4 low temperature recirculator vessel system pumpdown capacity is approximately 80% of the vessel volume at HLCO vessel equaling approximately 7907.4 lbs.  The worst case scenario is based upon release of 100% volume from the V-4 low temperature recirculator vessel of 1240 lbs in ten minutes (release rate of 680 lbs/minute) due to a catastrophic vessel failure caused by overfilling/over pressurization.  The low temperature recirculator vessel (V-4) is located inside the engine room.  Distance to toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles.  This calculation was performed using the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 Program.  Vessel volume calculations, data, residential population estimates, receptors, and an RMP*Comp printout is included as Appendix B.  Residential population, receptors, and map information on this scenario was determined using MCDC Missouri Census Data Center.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe capacity of the high temperature receiver vessel (V-1) at 100% is a"

A release associated with a pump seal fail does not apply as the pumps are hermitic which do not have shaft seals, the release scenario from the V-4 operating liquid level catastrophic release was covered in the Worst Case and vessel pad sitting protection was considered, the release from a PRV valve toxic endpoint is minimal; therefore these scenarios were not selected. \n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario release chosen was the outside HPL 3/4\" PO valve, (due to the number of locations and possibilities throughout the system with a release rate calculated at approximately 1509.65 lb/min (at 90 psig) for a 8.9 minute duration (due to the overall Intended System Inventory capacity of approximately 30,000 lbs. of ammonia as noted in the PSI information of the PSM Program, the total ammonia charge would be released within 20 minutes).  The release rate is calculated using the equations published in the NH3 New May/June 1995 by W. V. Richards, P.E.  This is consistent with the EPA's recommendations for an alternate release scenario in the RMP guidance document.  Using EPA*Comp, Version 1.07, the amount released would be approximately 13,300 lbs.  The toxic endpoint is estimated to be 0.3 miles.\n\n\n\nA copy of the toxic endpoint worksheet for the alternate release scenario, residential"
