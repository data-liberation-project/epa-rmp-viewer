              "Description": "Kuraray has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential of a release of any chemical on site. All storage tanks are located within diked areas; truck-unloading facilities have been replaced by direct pipeline feeds, which are equipped with low-pressure alarms and automated shut-off valves.  Furthermore, all of the process areas at this facility regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes containing materials that are subject to the EPA RMP Rule have been incorporated into the existing OSHA PSM program, resulting in a program that is in compliance with both the OSHA and EPA regulations.  Specific elements of this program include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation in process safety management and accident prevention,\n\n?    Process Safety Information,\n\n?    Process Hazards Analysis (PHA),\n\n?    Documented Operating Procedures,\n\n?    Training Programs for all Employees,\n\n?    Contractor Requirements and Training,\n\n?    Pre-startup Reviews,\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity and Quality Assurance Programs,\n\n?    Management of Change Process,\n\n?    Incident Investigation,\n\n?    Compliance Audits, and\n\n?    Safe Work Practices.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history 40 CFR ? 68.155 (e):\n\n\n\nEVAL has had one accident involving ethylene and resulted in a fire and injuries to employees or contractors.  There were no injuries, exposure or impact to the public.  There have been changes made to facility equipment and process controls, improved training, operating procedures, and emergency response as a result of the accident.   Refer to section 6 of this submission for additional information.\n\n\n\n40 CFR ? 68.155 (f)    Emergency response program:\n\n\n\nKuraray's emergency response program is compliant with the OSHA 29 CFR ? 1910.38 standards, as well as meeting the RMP requirements. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and any potentially affected neighbors and has been coordinated with local agencies.\n\n\n\nKuraray maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers and the general public as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid, medical treatment for exposure, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The emergency response program is updated when additional process units are brought on line or when modifications are made to an existing process unit. When the emergency response program is updated, employees are informed of the changes and trained appropriately through the management of change (MOC) process.\n\n\n\n",

              "Description": "Kuraray has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential of a release of any chemical on site. All storage tanks are located within diked areas; truck-unloading facilities have been replaced by direct pipeline feeds, which are equipped with low-pressure alarms and automated shut-off valves.  Furthermore, all of the process areas at this facility regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes containing materials that are subject to the EPA RMP Rule have been incorporated into the existing OSHA PSM program, resulting in a program that is in compliance with both the OSHA and EPA regulations.  Specific elements of this program include the following:\n\n\n\n?    Employee Participation in process safety management and accident prevention,\n\n?    Process Safety Information,\n\n?    Process Hazards Analysis (PHA),\n\n?    Documented Operating Procedures,\n\n?    Training Programs for all Employees,\n\n?    Contractor Requirements and Training,\n\n?    Pre-startup Reviews,\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity and Quality Assurance Programs,\n\n?    Management of Change Process,\n\n?    Incident Investigation,\n\n?    Compliance Audits, and\n\n?    Safe Work Practices.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history 40 CFR ? 68.155 (e):\n\n\n\nEVAL has had one accident involving ethylene and resulted in a fire and injuries to employees or contractors.  There were no injuries, exposure or impact to the public.  There have been changes made to facility equipment and process controls, improved training, operating procedures, and emergency response as a result of the accident.   Refer to section 6 of this submission for additional information.\n\n\n\n40 CFR ? 68.155 (f)    Emergency response program:\n\n\n\nKuraray's emergency response program is compliant with the OSHA 29 CFR ? 1910.38 standards, as well as meeting the RMP requirements. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and any potentially affected neighbors and has been coordinated with local agencies.\n\n\n\nKuraray maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers and the general public as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid, medical treatment for exposure, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The emergency response program is updated when additional process units are brought on line or when modifications are made to an existing process unit. When the emergency response program is updated, employees are informed of the changes and trained appropriately through the management of change (MOC) process.\n\n",
