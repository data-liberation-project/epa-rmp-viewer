      "SummaryText": "(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Occidental Permian Ltd's Terrell Gas Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures, which are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, Terrell personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  This document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\n(b) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Terrell Gas Plant is designed to process produced gas and strip CO2 and H2S from the inlet gas stream, which is sold for reinjection purposes.  The compressed natural gas is predominately methane and is sold for fuel.  Our evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the Terrell Gas Plant process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with only our methane inventories exceeding threshold quantities of the listed regulated substances.\r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nTerrell Gas Plant is a Program Level 1 and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.\r\n\r\n(d) Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn review of the Terrell Gas Plant's incident records for the past five years, we have not experienced an accidental release from a covered process resulting in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n(e) Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Terrell Ga"

      "SummaryText": "s Plant maintains a written emergency action plan to control and contain an accidental release of a regulated substance.  Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  We have coordinated our emergency response activities with the Sanderson, Texas emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety \r\n\r\n1. We will continue to utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing any Terrell incidents.\r\n2. We will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Occidental Permian Ltd. plants.\r\n3. We will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program. \r\nCertification\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst case accidental release scenario for the following process (es) is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor:\r\n\r\nCO2 Absorbtion\r\n\r\nWithin the past 5 years the process (es) has (have) had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 GFR 68.10(b)(1). No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases. In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of regulated substance from the process (es), entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergency responders. Therefore, public emergency responders should not enter this area except as arranged with the emergency contact indicated in the RMP plan. The undersigned certifies that, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, ac"
