      "SummaryText": "American Crystal Sugar Company is a beet sugar manufacturing plant.  The quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methane at the facility are greater than the Threshold quantities (TQ) of 5,000 pounds and 10,000 pounds for the respective chemicals.  This is EPA's criteria for requiring the development and submittal of the information found in this RMP.  A hazard assessment was conducted for the manufacturing process and consideration is also given to the other hazardous chemicals at the plant as well.\n\nSO2 is considered toxic and methane is considered flammable by EPA standards.  The same properties that make SO2 valuable for beet sugar processing, and methane as a fuel supply, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community and/or environment.  Safety depends upon the mannner in which we handle chemicals; combines with safety devices inherent in the design of this facility; and the training of our personnel.  \n\nTHE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is this facility's intent to uphold industry standards in the design, construction and operation of the facility.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency was to occur, we have trained personnel and equipment ready for response in the event of a spill of hazardous materials.  It is also our policy to notify the Hillsboro Fire Department (via the 911 system), and request that they respond to the emergency if the emergency is beyond our capabilities.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSO2 is used at the plant for processing the sugar beets into some of the various products.  SO2 is received and stored in a 19800 gallon pressurized tank.  Inventory of SO2 held at the facility is a maximum of 239000 pounds held in the tank along with residual in process piping. Li"

      "SummaryText": "quid SO2 passes out of the tank, through process piping, then branches into one of two process endpoints.  Prior to each end use, the SO2 passes through a vaporizer, which transitions it to a gaseous state.  It then flows into the process endpoint.  Approximately 65% of the SO2 is used in the diffuser water supply and the other 25% is used in the sulfitation of thin juice and 10% in pup press water.\n\nMethane is generated by the anaerobic digestion of facility waste water.  As waste water is pumped through the digestion vessel, bacterial consumption of organic material in the water releases a flammable gaseous mixture.  This mixture is composed of approximately 70% methane and the balance being carbon dioxide with traces of hydrogen and nitrogen gas.  The volume of methane in the head space of the digester is calculated to be 19200 lb.  The methane is used as a fuel source for the pulp dryer furnaces and excess methane is burned off at a flaring station.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and will all applicable state codes and regulations.  ACSC takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes.  Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect the covered processes are all considered.  By conducting thorough evaluations, accidental releases are prevented and the consequences of releases are minimized.\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the RMP standards, ACSC intends to prevent releases of hazardous substances and minimize the impacts of accidental releases, especially into locations that could expose employees, the community or the environment to serious hazards.  Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n- Maintaining Process Saf"

      "SummaryText": "r.\n\nOur Company and our employees are committed to the standards that the RMP regulation sets.  We do business, and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting high standards for accident prevention.  ACSC has also developed a risk management system which identifies specific job positions and responsibilities to ensure proper management and implementation of this RMP.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of SO2, methane, or other toxic/extremely hazardous chemicals in the past 5 years, which have resulted in off-site consequences such as personal injury, death, or response/restoration activities.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe have discussed the content and intent of this program with the Hillsboro Fire Department.  We rely on our trained, in-house staff and on-site equipment for initial response (if safe to do so) and acquire backup support from the local fire department as needed.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nACSC plans to install additional sensors, alarms and monitoring devices to our processes to improve our ability to detect and respond to accidental releases from process equipment."
