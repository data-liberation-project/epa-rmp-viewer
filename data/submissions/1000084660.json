Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\r\n\r\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. is committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the ammonia refrigeration system at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate control measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur; our highly trained employees are on hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Olathe Fire Department, who provide our emergency response services.\r\n\r\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\r\n\r\nWe have one extremely hazardous substance present at our facility that is subject to the Process Safety and Risk Management Planning regulations. That substance is Ammonia (anhydrous). The maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present at this facility, based upon process and operational requirements is approximately 17,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nSysco Kansas City, Inc. has taken the following steps as required by 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA. Our Ammonia (anhydrous) process is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to the EPA Emergency Planning and Community Right To Know Act (EPCRA) Section 302 reporting requirements.
