The Facility Plan\n\n   The owners, management, and employees of Golden Triangle Energy are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia stored on site and flammable liquids stored in the tank farm.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n  The primary activity at the facility is the manufacture of ethanol.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used in the process. Flammables are received, stored and processed on site as part of mixture called natural gasoline used to denature fuel ethanol.  The maximum quantity of ammonia stored would be 84,100 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity of flammables stored would be 99,079 lbs in Tank 805 in the tank farm.\n\n  \n\n3.  The Worst-case and Alternative Release scenarios\n\n   a. Ammonia: The worst case release scenario for ammonia would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank.  The maximum quantity released would be 84,100 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is 5.1 miles, with possible offsite impacts as shown in section two.  The alternative release scenario for ammonia based on the most likely potential accident is a release from a ruptured fill line from a tanker truck.  The distance to endpoint, (point of dispersion to 200 ppm), is 0.2 miles, with possible off site impacts as shown in Section three. \n\n\n\n   b. Flammables: The worst case scenario for a flammable liquids release would be a 95,603 lbs release from the tank or piping resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The estimated distance to 1psi overpressure would be 0.2 miles, with offsite impacts shown in section two.  The alternate release scenario for flammables would be a tanker truck leak at the load out area near the tank farm resulting from a broken valve or hose failure causing "

      "SummaryText": "a pool fire. Total release could be 3250 lbs. The heat radiation endpoint was found to be 0.2 miles, with offsite impacts shown in section three.\n\n\n\n 4.  The accidental release prevention program \n\n     The ammonia system was designed per ASME code standards.   In addition the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29CFR910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" are followed by Golden Triangle.\n\n\n\nThe denaturant tank was built to API-650.  Pumps and adjoining piping were inspected to conformance with API 570. The tank is contained inside of a diked and lined tank farm. \n\n\n\n5.  The Five year Accident History\n\n     On January 29, 2013 a small leak from a pressure relief valve was discovered by operation personnel in the early morning hours. The leak was immediately isolated and stopped. Most of the ammonia leaked and pooled inside of the plant. No ammonia left plant property and no injuries or property damage were sustained. A report was filed with the EPA emergency response and the local LEPC. A copy of that report is retained with our newest compliance certification document.\n\n\n\n6.   The emergency response program\n\n      Golden Triangle Energy has an emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR1910.38.  State and local authorities have been provided the emergency planning and community right-to-know information (EPCRA).\n\n\n\n 7.   Planned changes to improve safety\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Safety meetings and safety equipment checks are conducted annually.  There is no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety or fire prevention procedures or training recommendations at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
