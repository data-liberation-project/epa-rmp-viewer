      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nWise Alloys LLC owns and operates an aluminum rolling facility in Muscle Shoals, AL. This facility is known as the Alloys Plant and is located at 4805 Second Street. The rolling mill facility consists of a plant which manufactures bare and coated aluminum coil. Reynolds Metals Company built the facility in 1941.  It was purchased by Wise Alloys LLC in April 1999. This facility is one of the largest in the world of its kind and has processes including aluminum casting, hot rolling, cold rolling, annealing, coil coating, slitting, leveling, packing, shipping and storage. The facility employs 793 full-time employees. \n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices at the Stationary Source (68.155(a))\n\nWise Alloys LLC is committed to operating the Alloys Plant in a manner that is safe for workers, the public and the environment. It is our policy to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices. As part of this commitment, the Alloys Plant has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this facility which includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risk at the Alloys Plant and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and OSHA 1910.119. The document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP -rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Alloys Plant. \n\nThe RMP at the Alloys Plant consists of the following three elements: \nA?    A hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substa"

A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) \nA?    An emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes \n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMP Plan. \n\nAlthough the risk management program at the Alloys Plant helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety and environmental program at the Alloys Plant. In fact, the Alloys Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release. \n\nWise Alloys LLC's policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Alloys Plant, less hazardous alternatives are always considered. When a hazardous substance is used at the Alloys Plant, Wise Alloys reviews the potential for an accidental release of this substance which could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects. This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures which are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes. \n\nWise Alloys strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility. Wise Alloys implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. When a hazardous substance is used at the Alloys Plant, the equipment is carefully designed, installed, operated and maintained to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in the design, construction and operation of equipment. Each project i"

In addition, Wise Alloys requires the documentation Qf standard operating procedures and training of affected employees with regard to these procedures as part of the MOC procedure. The Alloys Plant's Mechanical \nIntegrity program provides an ongoing process to verify the mechanical integrity of the equipment, piping and instruments to prevent the release of hazardous substances. \nThe Alloys Plant's goal is to minimize impacts from an accidental release. In the event of an accidental release the Alloys Plant controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will prevent' impact to the public and the environment. Wise Alloys utilizes emergency response plans as required by government regulation. Wise Alloys trains its workers to respond to an accidental release, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. The Alloys Plant also has designated Gate 5 as a Special Situations Center to assist in all emergencies. In addition, Wise Alloys works with the local fire department and with the local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to help prevent injuries and/or environmental damage if a release does occur. Wise Alloys has assisted the LEPC in writing and implementing the Colbert County Community Awareness and Emergency Plan (CAER). \n\nThe Alloys Plant emergency response plan has been developed to meet the emergency planning, response and notification requirements of the Federal, OSHA, and EPA regulations. This plan outlines the responsibilities and actions required to control an emergency that limits itself to within the Alloys Plant. If the emergency extends beyond the plant boundaries and affects the surrounding communities, the Colbert County Community Awareness and Emergency Plan (CAER) is initiated by a call to 911 and a statement of the type of emergency. \n\nWise Alloys is an active participant in the community: Wise Alloys is an active participant in plant and community programs which promote"

Safety is a primary concern in our facility. \nIn order to effectively implement these policies, Wise Alloys established a management system headed by the Environmental Services Department and the Safety Department to oversee safety and environmental-related activities. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled (68.155(b))\nThe Alloys Plant handles several regulated substances that are covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered Program 3 processes at the plant. \nRegulated Substance-Chlorine, Casting Area Mix Station, Process Quantity-12,000 lb., RMP Threshold-2,500 lb. \nRegulated Substance-Sulfur Dioxide, High Speed Cleaning and Coating Line, Process Quantity 5,000 lb., RMP Threshold-5,000 lb. \nRegulated Substance-Flammable Liquids, Highspeed Cleaning and Coating Line, Process Quantity 98,000 lb., RMP Threshold-10,000lb. \n\nChlorine is used in the Casting Area as part of a gas mixture which is used to flux molten aluminum and drive off any metal impurities. The chlorine is mixed with other gases at a chlorine mix station. One ton containers of liquid chlorine are utilized at this mix station.\n\nSulfur dioxide is used at the High Speed Cleaning and Coating Line wastewater treatment facility to adjust pH as part of the wastewater treatment system. One ton containers are utilized at this wastewater treatment facility. \n\nRegulated flammable liquids are used at the High Speed Cleaning and Coating Line. These are the liquid coatings and solvents that are pumped from underground storage tanks to the coater head which applies various coatings to aluminum strip. \n\n3.

The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a \"worst-case release scenario\" and an \"alternate release scenario.\" In reality, however, Wise Alloys does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The alternative release scenarios are developed to help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan. \n\nThe RMP*COMPA? system was used to calculate a distance to the toxic endpoint. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The EPA recommended Landview program was utilized to estimate the number of people living within the circle of any release scenarios. USGS maps were utilized to identify the public and environmental receptors located within any release circle. \n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps (68.155) \nBeginning in 1994, the Alloys Plant initiated this prevention program to comply with the 14 elements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program.  In 1996, the EPA RMP rule established two levels of prevention requirements: \n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment outside the Alloys Plant fenceline; \n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the Alloys Plant's Program 3 prevention program that addresses EPA's RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n4.1 Program 3 Prevention Program \nThe Alloys Plant's Program 3 prevention program consists of the following twelve elements: \n\n4.1.1 Process Safety Information \nThe Alloys Plant maintains technical documents v/hich are used to help ensure safe operation of the plant processes.
