Executive Summary\n\nThis program is intended to meet the spirit and intent of the following regulations:\n\n- California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\n\n- Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR ?68\n\n- California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR ?5189\n\n- Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR ?1910.119\n\n\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\n\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\". As such, the information, procedures, policies, and\n\ndocumentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To\n\naccomplish this, POM Wonderful has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by\n\nResource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking\n\nRMP-PSM related activities.\n\n\n\n1.1 POM Wonderful, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\n\n\n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that POM Wonderful has updated/developed their\n\nunified RMP-PSM Program.

Utilized PSMWriter software to ensure that all necessary employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\n\n\n\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees and neighbors\n\nprotect themselves.\n\n\n\n1.2 Process Descriptions\n\n\n\nPOM Wonderful operates a cold storage facility that performs activities related pomegranate storage and juice\n\nproduction. The facility has two (2) ammonia systems (Fresh System and Juice System). The Fresh System\n\nprovides refrigerating capacity to seven cold rooms, two anti-rooms, a shipping area, the mechanical room, and\n\nsixteen controlled atmosphere rooms. The rooms use a combination of \"bunker style\" coils and ceiling\n\nsuspended evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia. Some of the ceiling suspended coils operate\n\nunder flooded conditions and some under direct expansion. The Juice System provides refrigerating capacity to\n\na shell and tube heat exchanger, a plate and frame heat exchanger, the Tank Room, and the Blend Room. A\n\ncomputer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\n\n\nThe Fresh System operates as follows: high pressure liquid from our high pressure receivers is piped through\n\nthe king solenoid valve. From there it is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a\n\nsolenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel. From the\n\naccumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid\n\nammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The\n\nammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction\n\naccumulator in the engine room. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge\n\nfrom the compressors is sent to our"

Liquid separated from the suction\n\nreturn gas in the main suction accumulator drains into liquid transfer vessels. Operation of a float switch\n\nactivated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained\n\ninto the high pressure receivers. Some of the coils (Anti-Room 2) are direct expansion coils. In those coils,\n\nhigh pressure ammonia liquid is piped directly to each coil where it passes through a solenoid valve, a hand\n\nexpansion valve, and directly into the coil. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low\n\ntemperature & pressure gas which is returned directly to the main suction accumulator via the suction main.\n\nThe facility was originally called Met-West and then later changed to Paramount Fruit. In 2007, the name\n\nchanged to POM Wonderful. The facility was built more than 20 years ago. More recently the following projects\n\nhave occurred:\n\n2004 - California Controlled Atmosphere added eight (8) new controlled atmosphere rooms\n\n2006 - California Controlled Atmosphere added two (2) new high pressure receivers\n\n2006 - California Controlled Atmosphere made modifications to the compressor oil cooling on the Fresh System\n\n2007 - California Controlled Atmosphere added a screw compressor and condenser to the Juice System\n\n2008 - California Controlled Atmosphere installed a complete computer control system on for the Juice System\n\n2009 - California Controlled Atmosphere installed a compressor, condenser, and plate and frame heat exchanger on the Juice System\n\n2010 - Ross & Sons installed a 500 hp screw compressor and ten (10) coils in the Fresh System\n\n\n\nThe systems contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or\n\npressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to"

In addition, ammonia detectors are located in selected areas of the facility, and will shut\n\ndown equipment if ammonia is detected. Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn\n\noff equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such\n\nthat a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore,\n\nwe are treating the each system as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General\n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous\n\nammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as\n\nevacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nPOM Wonderful has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release\n\nscenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event\n\nof an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the POM Wonderful facility is an integral part of the overall business and\n\noperates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and\n\nefficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential\n\ndanger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active logbook of all\n\nprocedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of\n\nthe outside refrigeration contractors that "

The approximate leak area was 0.0367 sq. in. During the first 5 minutes of the\n\nrelease the approximate pressure in the pipe was 135 psig. After 5 minutes, all necessary valves were isolated\n\nand the pressure dropped to 10 psig. It took approximately 25 minutes for the release to stop once the valves\n\nwere isolated. Using Equation (3) in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration, it is\n\nestimated that 850 lb of ammonia were released over a 30 minute period.\n\n\n\nFurther details about resolution and follow up actions are contained in Incident Investigation report 2009-01.\n\n\n\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nPOM Wonderful's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following\n\nrequirements:\n\nCalifornia \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR ?3220\n\nFederal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR ?1910.38\n\n\n\nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and\n\nevacuate the facility.

Nevertheless, POM Wonderful continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM\n\nprogram.
