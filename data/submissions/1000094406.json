The latitude and longitude of the high pressure receiver is 35.820413, -119.260581. The facility is located approximately 500 feet west of state highway 99 in a rural area surrounded primarily by agriculture land.\n\n\n\nFlood Hazards\n\nAccording to FEMA Flood Map Service, the facility is located in \"an area of minimal flood hazard\".\n\n\n\nSeismic Susceptibility\n\nBlanc Vineyards Plant 2 is not located in an Alquist-Priolo Fault Zone as defined by the California Department of Conservation. In addition, a review of United States Geological Survey (USGS) fault maps showed that faults within close proximity are not considered high risk:\n\nPond Fault - <150 Years\n\nPoso Creek Fault - <1,600,000 Years\n\nUnnamed Fault Near Rag Gulch- <1,600,000 Years\n\nThe USGS 2018 One-Year Model revealed that Blanc Vineyards Plant 1 has a 1-2% chance of experiencing \"potentially minor-damage\" due to ground shaking in 2018.\n\n\n\nDescription of Covered Process\n\n\n\nPumped Overfeed System\n\n\n\nThe refrigerated areas are equipped with air-cooling evaporators which are supplied from recirculators as required for pumped overfeed operation.\n\n\n\nMost control valve groups are located inside the machinery room or directly outside the associated refrigerated room  to provide easy access.

The function and thermodynamics of each major component type in the system is summarized below:\n\n\n\nHigh Pressure Receivers\n\nThe purpose of the high pressure receivers is to provide a safe location to add and store high pressure liquid ammonia in the refrigeration system. The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condenser and supply high pressure liquid to each recirculator and liquid injection cooling to the screw compressor. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. High Pressure Receiver 1 is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nHigh Temperature Recirculators\n\nThe purpose of the high temperature recirculators is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid that can be used in high temperature evaporators throughout the facility. The high temperature recirculators receive liquid from High Pressure Receiver 1 and supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the ammonia pumps mounted underneath the supplying vessel. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the recirculators to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each high stage compressor. The high temperature recirculators are each equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the high temperature recirculators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Pumped Overfeed)"

      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the recirculators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nCompressors\n\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the recirculators and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\n\n\nEvaporative Condenser\n\nThe purpose of the evaporative condenser is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condenser receives high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supplies high pressure liquid to the high pressure receivers. The condenser uses air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receivers. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condenser contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia."

A Sherlock Panel provides central monitoring of ammonia detection and alerts personnel if the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm. Audible/visual alarms are available inside and outside  the machinery room. If the concentration reaches 25 ppm, the emergency ventilation system will be activated. Once the ammonia concentration reaches 450 ppm, the compressors in the machinery room will be de-energized.\n\n\n\nRelief Valves\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing. Details regarding the relief valves are summarized below:\n\nEach relief valve has a set pressure equal to or less than the MAWP of the equipment that the relief valve protects;\n\nEach relief valve has a capacity which meets or exceeds the requirement of ANSI/IIAR 2-2014 Addendum A ?15.3.8;\n\nAll relief valves terminate to the atmosphere, 7.25 ft above the roof;\n\nSelect relief valve assemblies are equipped with a relief vent indicator (RVI) to assist in recognizing that an overpressure event has occurred. Indicator flags are mounted to the shaft of the RVI on the outside of the housing. A paddle is set such that any sudden flow in the relief vent line pushes it down simultaneously raising the flags which then provide a clear signal that a relief valve has lifted. Stoppers mounted to the exterior prevent the flag/shaft from rotating more than the 90? swing.\n\n\n\nScrew Compressor Safety Devices\n\nEach screw compressor has numerous safety devices to protect the compressor and the associated equipment.
