The Missouri American Water Company Central Water Treatment Plant, located on the Missouri River in Chesterfield, serves customers in Central and West St. Louis County, and has the capacity to produce 217 million gallons of drinking water per day.  Chlorine, a disinfectant used in the water treatment process, is covered under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations. Missouri American Water Company complies with these regulations, as well as others, to ensure that the risks involved in the handling, use and storage of chlorine are minimized.

Due to the hazards of chlorine, however, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in order to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure. \n WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO \nThe worst-case release scenario at the Missouri American Water Company Central Water Treatment Plant is the failure of a 55-ton railcar of chlorine.  The vapor cloud formed as a result of the release would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors.  This worst-case scenario is highly unlikely as it assumes a complete failure of the vessel, the failure of all safety systems, no emergency response and worst-case weather conditions.                                       \nALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO                                                                                                   \nAn alternative release scenario would involve a leak from the piping during the hook-up of a 2,000 pound container of chlorine.
