Facility Policy:\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of FREMAR Farmers Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Marion Fire Department, The Turner County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage  of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhdrous Ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximum quantity stored would be 210,000 pounds in storage tanks and in tanks.\n\n3.   Worse-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario:\n\n   a.  The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quatity would be 53,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards and controls. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is .74 mile.\n\n   b.   The alternate release scenario: a 3 inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release scenario followed by the release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow shut-down valve or valves intervenes or the remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 28,000 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .59 mile.\n\n4.   Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\n  The facility is in compliance with the provisions of the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The OSHA"

Five Year Accident History:\n\n  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significantproperty damage at the facility; nor, to our knowledge, has THERE BEEN ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASES resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.   Emergency Action Plan:\n\n       The facility has:\n\n        a. A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR 1910.38;\n\n        b. Provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know       \n            as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n      Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are performed  to   assess  the conditions of the facility. There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding storage or use of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
