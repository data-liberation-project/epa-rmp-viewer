(LPI) is an agricultural micronutrient manufacturing facility located in Fairbury, Nebraska. There are two stationary sources covered by this Risk Management Plan at the Fairbury site.  These are the Ammonia Process and the 10-34-0 Process. The Ammonia Process is an existing manufacturing process covered under previous RMPs.  The new process, the 10-34-0 Process, will be subject to the RMP regulation when it becomes operational in the spring of 2016.  LPI maintains and/or manages all of the equipment in its processes by employing the best engineering practices in the industry.  LPI strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nMeeting environmental regulations is part of LPI's policies and by developing and maintaining this Risk Management Program, LPI is complying with the Federal Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68). LPI is committed to the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nLPI maintains a thorough, detailed Emergency Response Plan designed specifically for an ammonia release from either the Ammonia Process or the 10-34-0 Process.  The plan is periodically reviewed with outside emergency response organizations.\r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(b)   \tStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nLPI Ammonia Process (currently in operation):\r\n\r\nThe LPI Ammonia Process produces a fertilizer solution by reacting water, anhydrous ammonia, acetic acid, and a variety of metal salts (minerals) in two low pressure mix tanks. Liquid anhydrous ammonia is stored in a 30,000 gallon (150,000 pound) pressure vessel under ambient temperature. The pressure vessel has a maximum fill level of 85% resulting in a maximum storage capacity of 25,000 gallons or 125,000"

The vessel is equipped with a flash valve that prohibits a ruptured line or valve from emptying the vessel.\r\n\r\nApproximately 200 feet of 2\" service line connected the pressure vessel to the process building. The first 100 feet of the service line is underground.  The service line is equipped with an emergency trip valve, a 2\" gate valve, an electronic flow valve, and a manual 1\" ball valve.\r\n\r\nLPI 10-34-0 Process (expected startup in spring 2016):\r\n\r\nThe LPI 10-34-0 process produces 10-34-0 fertilizer solution by reacting anhydrous ammonia with super phosphoric acid.   The process is self-contained on a trailer-mounted Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR), owned and operated by Blick's Phosphate Conversions, LLC, of Garden City, KS.   For this process, the anhydrous ammonia is supplied via 42,000 pound tank trucks, which directly feed the 10-34-0 process.  The phosphoric acid is supplied via railcar.  The result 10-34-0 fertilizer solution is then subsequently stored on site for distribution to customers.  The MPR is equipped with a safety relief valve to protect against overpressure.  \r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(c)   \tWorst-Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release\r\nScenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation\r\nMeasures to Limit the Distance for Each Reported Scenario\r\n\r\nUnder the Risk Management Program, an offsite consequence analysis is required for an accidental release of a regulated substance.  In LPI's case, anhydrous ammonia is the regulated substance. Modeling of a worst-case release scenario and two alternative release scenarios for anhydrous ammonia are required for the offsite consequence analysis under Program 3.  \r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for the Loveland Products, Inc. Fairbury site is the loss of 125,000 pounds of pressurized anhydrous ammonia representing a complete failure of the pressure vessel. Per the definition of the worst-case scenario under the RMP regulation"

      "SummaryText": ", the entire content of the pressure vessel is assumed to be released to the atmosphere in 10 minutes.  This corresponds to a release rate of 12,500 pounds/min. of anhydrous ammonia.   \r\n\r\nThe offsite toxic endpoint concentration for an ammonia release has been established by EPA to be 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm by mass (40 CFR Part 68, Appendix A).  This is the concentration to which an ordinary person could be exposed for up to one (1) hour without experiencing permanent health effects.  RMP-Comp, a computerized dispersion modeling program available from USEPA, was used to determine the maximum downwind distance that an anhydrous ammonia release could travel at the toxic endpoint concentration.  The computer modeling shows that for the worst-case scenario, a toxic endpoint concentration of anhydrous ammonia would extend to 6.9 miles downwind.  This is an updated and corrected distance from the previous RMP submission; the previous endpoint distance was 2.5 miles.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia potentially released under the worst-case scenario has not increased.  Rather, an incorrect atmospheric stability factor was used when calculating the WCS.  Based on population data from MARPLOT, the potentially affected population has not increased, due to the rural location of the Fairbury site.\r\n\r\nThere are two (2) alternative release scenarios applicable to the Loveland Products, Inc. Fairbury site, one for each process:\r\n\r\nFor the LPI Ammonia Process, the alternate case scenario is for the release of 125,000 pounds of pressurized anhydrous ammonia resulting from a failed connection on the pressure vessel.  The entire contents of the pressure vessel is released to the atmosphere over a 60 minute period, resulting in a release rate of 2,083 pounds/min.  The computer modeling via RMP-Comp shows that for the alternate-case scenario for the LPI Ammonia Process, a toxic endpoint concentration of anhydrous ammonia would extend to 0.8 miles downwind.  \r\n\r\nFor the LPI 10-34-0 Proces"

      "SummaryText": "s, the alternate-case scenario is for the release of anhydrous ammonia from a failed transfer hose connection between the ammonia tank trailer and the Mobile Pipe Reactor (MPR) trailer.  The anhydrous ammonia tank trailers are equipped with excess flow valves (per 40 CFR 172) which will shut off all flow within 20 seconds of a catastrophic hose failure.  The Process Hazard Analysis Software Tool (PHAST), by DNV was used to estimate the release rate from the failed hose connection.  The failed transfer hose will release 1620 pounds of anhydrous ammonia before the excess flow valve activates.   The computer modeling via RMP-Comp shows that for the alternate-case scenario for the LPI 10-34-0 Process, a toxic endpoint concentration of anhydrous ammonia would extend to 1.3 miles downwind.  \r\n\r\n40 CFR 68.155(d)   \tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nLPI has a Release Prevention Program in place to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at this facility. The Release Prevention Program includes:\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\nLPI has developed and kept current, working copies of PSI documentation including information pertaining to hazards of the processes, the technology of the processes and the equipment employed in the processes.  All employees involve in the processes have been trained in the operation of the processes and all contractors will be given training before performing work in the process areas. The PSI will enable the employees and contractors of LPI to identify and understand the hazards posted by the process involving anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\nLPI is committed to performing PHAs to identify, evaluate, and control hazards associated with plant operations.  These PHAs are intended to identify potential hazardous consequences, determine the likelihood and severity of these consequences, and evaluate whether safety systems, mitigation systems, and emergency systems"
