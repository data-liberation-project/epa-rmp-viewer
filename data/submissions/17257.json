This commitment is shown by the resources invested in accident prevention such as training and safety design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes. Mercury will implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. If a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant located at 8892 West 7 Mile Road, Grayling, Michigan, operates a cryogenic plant to produce petroleum products (e.g. natural gas liquids, butane, propane. etc.) from natural gas. The Beaver Creek Gas Plant produces two (2) regulated flammable substances. The plant uses propane as the cryogenic fluid while producing ethane and propane as saleable products.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) associated with the release of flammable substances in Program Level 2 at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the storage tank containing natural gas liquids by refrigeration. This WCS would release 95,000# of ngl (80% volume of the storage vessel). The major constituent is propane. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint is .3 miles.\n\nThe alternate release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the gas plant is a BLEVE resulting from the release of ngl from a line break and the resulting vaporization and ignition of the refrigerated liquids. It was assumed that all ngl in storage would be released. The release would not be expected to be isolated by the operators due to the plant's remote location. Upon arrival, operators would employ the emergency shut down (ESD) devices at the refrigeration plant to control any further problems.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Programs\n\nThe following is a summary"

The plant is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Plan and is not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard. The following summary addresses the management system in place.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant encourages employee's participation in all facets of safety and accident prevention. Regular safety meetings are held with plant personnel and field personnel in acquaint them with safety at the various facilities operated by Mercury. Employees have access to all information concerning the plant's operation, field operations, chemicals used, emergency procedures, location and use of material safety data sheets (MSDS) and first aid.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. The documents address chemical properties and associated hazards and equipment design information. \n\nChemical information is provided by the use of MSDS sheets. The plant ensures process maintenance using process controls, trained personnel, and automatic shut down devices.\n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical manuals that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction. Designs pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written operating procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluation proposed changes to ensure safety is not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant has a program in place to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. The program requires each process be examined to i"

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using people who have operating and maintenance experience. These personnel identify and evaluate hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. Suggestions or additional written procedures or controls are made when these actions are believed necessary.\n\nThe finding of the HAZOP are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of options is based on relative risk factors assigned during the HAZOP study. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\nTo help ensure that process controls do not deviate significantly from the original safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the HAZOP results. These reviews are conducted every 5 years and will continue at this rate until the plant is dismantled. The result of these findings are documented and retained. Management is forwarded copies of the findings are responsible for their resolution.\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe beaver Creek Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown and (4) normal shutdown. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. \n\nTraining\n\nNew employees receive basic training in gas plant operations even if they are already familiar with such operations. After demonstrating adequate knowledge of the processes and ability to work in a safe mann"

In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented and the verification methods (tests) kept on file for each operator.\n\nContractors\n\nContractors may be used during times of heavy maintenance or change out of critical pieces of equipment. Contractors are allowed to work on or near the gas plant only while supervised by a plant operator. Contractors are informed of procedures and are instructed to discuss all operations before beginning said operations. Plant operators are instructed to observe contractors to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what to do in the event of an emergency, and (5) understand and follow site safety rules. Mercury evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor for work at the gas plant.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. The PSSR includes a field verification of the construction against drawings.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant has established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measu"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service. If unable to correct the problem, the plant will be shut down until repair or replacement is finished.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) a lockout/tagout procedure, (2) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping or equipment is opened, (3) a hot work permit program, and (4) a confined space entry program. \n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Beaver Creek Gas Plant is a self-contained cryogenic liquid plant requiring the use of special metals and equipment. Change to any part of the equipment or processes require careful control of these changes. A management of change authorization form is required if the equipment will not be \"changed in kind\". Change in kind requires that the same size, metallurgy, seals, relief valve, fittings, and connection devices be used as the original equipment. Any other change requires management approval along with safety and engineering approvals.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAll incidents are required to be reported to management. This includes any incident that could cause personal injury, release of toxic/flammable chemicals, minor and major property damage, or environmental loss. The goal of such investigations is to determine the facts of the incident and develop procedures to prevent future re-occurrence. All employees are informed of the incident and findings and recommendations are tracked until final resolution. Records are maintained for a minimum of 5 years. Records are used as part of PHA revalidation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nCompliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years to ensure that procedures and programs are funct"
