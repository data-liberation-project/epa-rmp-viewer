Oxy Vinyls, LP, referred to as OxyVinyls, is a joint venture between Occidental Chemical Corporation (a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation) and The Geon Company. This facility is located in Deer Park, Texas on Tidal Road.  The Deer Park PVC Site manufactures PVC from polymerization of vinyl chloride and ships PVC resin to external customers via railcar.  The facility was originally constructed in 1974 and employs approximately 70 full-time employees.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source  (' 68.155(a))\n\nOxyVinyls is committed to operating the Deer Park PVC Site in a manner that is safe for its workers, the public and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local rules and regulations, industry standards and best practices.  As part of this commitment, OxyVinyls has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility that includes the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that provides the basis for managing risks at the Deer Park PVC Site.  The RMP complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Deer Park PVC Site.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the Deer Park PVC Site consists of the following three elements:\n \n7 A hazard assessment to (a) help the facility and community understand the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and to (b) provide information to the public regarding accidents that"

The Deer Park LEPC meets every month and conducts annual training exercises of the emergency response plan. The company's emergency response plan has been communicated to CIMA, the Deer Park Fire Department, and the Deer Park LEPC.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety (' 68.155(g))\n\nThe Deer Park PVC Site constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, process hazard analysis, and a program for soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.  \n\n8.

Audit specialists who are knowledgeable in the process and who have been trained in the auditing process have been employed to review the facility prevention program.  These audits evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the EPA RMP rule and OSHA PSM standard, and whether the prevention program is effectively implemented.  The results of audits are documented, recommendations are assigned to individuals to be resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.  In addition, monthly audits of process activities are conducted, often with the assistance of outside customers and suppliers.\n\n4.9  Incident Investigation\nThe Deer Park PVC Site investigates incidents, including near misses and operational errors, that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or could have caused damage to the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented in the future. An investigation team referred to as a Board of Inquiry is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are assigned to persons to be resolved, and appropriate process or system enhancements are implemented.\n\n4.10  Employee Participation\nThe Deer Park PVC Site developed a written employee participation program for the facility to help ensure that the safety concerns of the plant's worker"

In fact, the Deer Park PVC Plant has a comprehensive safety and environmental program in place, establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance as well as injuries and damage from such a release.\n\nOxyVinyls' policy on the use of hazardous substances: Before using a hazardous substance at the Deer Park PVC Site, less hazardous alternatives are always considered.  When a hazardous substance is to be used at the Deer Park PVC Site, the plant personnel review the potential for an accidental release of this substance that could adversely affect plant workers, the public and the environment, and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  This is accomplished through the facility's Management of Change (MOC) and Process Hazard Review (PHR) procedures that are followed for all new installations or modifications of existing processes.\n\nOxyVinyls strives to prevent accidental releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility by implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.

The Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternate Release Scenario(s), Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distances for Each Reported Scenario (' 68.155(c))\n\nThe facility performed off-site consequence analyses of accidental releases of regulated substances to estimate the potential affects to the public or the environment.  The RMP rule requires the off-site consequence analysis to evaluate a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.  OxyVinyls does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur given the multiple levels of protection in place to prevent such a scenario.  The alternative release scenarios that have been developed are based on more likely potential accidental releases.  These have been shared with the LEPC to assist them in improving the community emergency response plan.  \n\nDistances to toxic and flammable endpoints were calculated based on the EPA RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. The meteorological data used for the modeling was the EPA default for the worst case scenario and EPA suggested values for the alternative release scenario. The Landview.
