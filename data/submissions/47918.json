              "Description": "The plan is to minimize those hazards to human health andto the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made beforfe they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In additiion to annual training foremployees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routenly invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fire department requests assistance in training its employees on anhydrous ammonia, the company cooperates fully in their endeavors.",

Facility Policy:  The owners, management and employees of Farmer?s Cooperative Elevator  Company located in Kingsley, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n\n2. Facility Information:  The primary activity at the site is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients, the maximum quantity stored would be about 325,500 pounds in one (1)  25,000 and one (1) 30,000- gallon storage tanks and 49 - 1,000 gallone nurse tanks which are parked from time-to-time at this site.\n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:  A) The Worst-Case Scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,250 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is about 4.4 miles.  B) The Alternate Release Scenario, based on the five-year accident history, or the most likely potential incident, is a release from a break in a 3\" transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 10 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia.  The maximum quantity released would be 2,800 pounds.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1 miles.  \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance"
