This includes procedures for receiving and inspecting chlorine shipments, monitoring and protecting the building and surrounding area, training employees, ensuring emergency procedures are in place, and providing information to local emergency agencies.\n\nOur supplier provides 150 pound chlorine cylinders that are secured in racks and storaged in our chlorine building until transported to our water wells.  Upon receipt , our employees follow procedures to insure cylinders and racks are in good condition and order.  The racks are placed in areas designated as full or empty.  No flammable or combustible chemicals are stored in the chlorine building.\n\nThe building is monitored continuously by chlorine sensor that is checked daily and serviced monthly.  The chlorine sensor remotely operates the chlorine exhaust fan and exterior alarm light. With the completion of the rebuilt fire station near this location, the chlorine sensor will be continuously monitored by fire or emergency dispatch personnel.  Additional fencing, a gate camera and other measures and procedures have been implemented to provide additional security at the chlorine building.\n\nProdedures have been updated and employees training continues concerning chlorine handling and receiving requirements, emergency training and SCBAs, MSDS sheet updates and revisits, forklift training, and other classes related to daily operations.\n\nA windsock has been placed on the building to aid personnel in evacuating the area and planning corrective action on-site.  In additional, we have a 150 pound emergency repair \"A\" kit on site.  The Chlorine Storage Building information with area site and contour maps have been updated and distributed to the Dothan Fire Department, Houston Coun"
