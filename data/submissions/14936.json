      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAmmonia is one of the most prevalent extremely hazardous substances.  Ammonia is one of the ten hazardous chemicals most commonly involved in a release. Because of the properties of ammonia, a release or spill does constitute a potential hazard for off-site release. To prevent and mitigate a Ammonia release and to improve facility safety, and benefit the community and the environment, J&J Wall Baking Company has developed policies and programs to prevent accidental release.  They include management commitment to safety, risk management plans, standard operating procedures, safety programs, preventative maintenance programs, contractor safety, and training. The most common causes of a Ammonia release are related to Operations and Maintenance failures, Equipment Failures and/or Process Failures; consequently, J&J Wall Baking Company has emphasized preventative maintenance, scheduling of replacement of parts, such as valves and gaskets, and training of maintenance employees in safe operations.\n\nAn Emergency Action Plan was previously submitted to the Sacramento County Environmental Management Department, Hazardous Material Division. All employees have been trained on relevant response procedures. There are written procedures for the use, inspection, maintenance and testing of emergency response equipment. The plan also includes evacuation routes, protective actions for uninvolved employees, a method of accounting for employees, and a list of personal protective equipment for response and mitigation equipment. The Emergency Action PLan also includes a procedures for informing the public and emergency response agencies in case of a release.

The operation involves three (3) flash freezing units which provides a spiral conveyance of dough products through the freezing compartment.\n\nJ&J Wall Baking Company uses anhydrous ammonia for freezing and cold storage of dough for baking goods. Anhydrous ammonia is contained within refrigeration piping and equipment, associated operations. Passage from room to room is by door or archway.  Many archways have split plastic curtains which provide a airflow barrier but allow passage of people and equipment.  The rooms in which the ammonia compressors are located are isolated from the work areas by 1 hour rated fire doors.  \n   \n-The regulated substance handled at this distribution facility is ammonia.  There is approximately 4,800 lbs. of ammonia on site for the freezing systems (nomore than 1,800 lbs. per system).  Ammonia is considered a regulated substance (EPA) or a highly hazardous substance (OSHA)  and the amount maintained on site by J&J Wall Baking Company exceeds the California Threshold Quantity (TQ) of 500 lbs. \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\n- The Worst Case scenario for J & J Wall Baking Co. is a release of liquid ammonia from the Frick High Pressure Receiver (HPR) located in the fenced area just outside the building.  This receiver is the largest of the three cooling systems and has a water capacity of 282 gallons. Administrative controls limit the contents of the HPR to 80% or 226 gallons of liquid ammonia. The worst case scenario assumes that the Frick system has been drained of all ammonia due to maintenance or repair and that the system has been recharged, but not operational, and 226 gallons are in the HPR. Therefore, the total release of anhydrous ammonia for the Worst"

The release would extend beyond the property boundary.\n\nAlternate scenario-J & J Wall Baking Co. in the HazOp study conducted to satisfy the California Risk Management and Prevention Program identified a \"most likely\" (Item 11 of the RMPP Hazard Evaluation Worksheet) release scenario.  This release scenario satisfies the criteria for the Alternate Toxic Gas Release.  This scenario involves a tanker truck 1.0-inch diameter liquid ammonia flexible hose breaking during a filling operation.  The hose holds 6 gallons (30.5 lbs.) of liquid ammonia. It was estimated in the HazOp that before the excess flow valve could shut down an additional 36.5 lbs. of liquid ammonia would be discharged.  The result of this scenario is a combined discharge of 67 lbs. of liquid ammonia.\n\n  The distance to the endpoint of 200 ppm ERPG-2 Type for the alternate case scenario is 840 ft., Gaussian direct source model results, and 1266 ft., Heavy Gas direct source.
