If the incident is determined to be a less than serious occurrence,\n\none that results in a minor injury, minor equipment damage or minor release/spill,\n\nthe completion of this form is sufficient.  If the incident is determined to be:\n\n\n\n * A serious occurrence,\n\n * One that has the potential to result in a lost work-day case,\n\n * One that resulted or could have resulted in damage to health, environment,\n\nproperty,\n\n * One that resulted in (or had the potential to result in) a catastrophic\n\nrelease of a hazardous or regulated substance,\n\n\n\nan incident investigation is started within 48 hours.

Various \n\nemployees including hourly and salaried employees participate in the audit by\n\ngathering required documentation, researching requested documentation, verifying\n\ninformation and participating in interviews.  The results of the two most recent\n\nOSHA PSM audits are fully documented and kept on file.
