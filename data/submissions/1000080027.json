      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\n\n\nVeolia's Burnside Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Burnside Plant manufactures and processes sulfuric acid in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. Raw material, intermediate and process storage tanks are used at the site.\n\n\n\nThe Burnside Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity. Based on process knowledge, Veolia identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site. The facility uses two regulated substances, sulfur trioxide and oleum, in the sulfuric acid process (Process 1). In addition, a railcar containing sulfur trioxide may rarely be stored on site for a short time without active shipping papers (Process 2).\n\n\n\nBased on worst-case analyses, the distances to endpoints [i.e. Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2) developed for each substance by the American Industrial Hygiene Association] exceed the distances to public receptors (i.e., off-site residences, institutions, industrial and commercial office buildings, parks, or recreational areas inhabited or occupied by the public). In addition, Veolia is subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) and is classified under a listed SIC Code 2819. Therefore, the sulfuric acid process and railcar storage are classified as Program 3 under the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program.\n\n\n\nOff-Site Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "Worst-Case Releases\n\n\n\nFlammable Substances\n\n\n\nThe endpoint for the worst-case release of a flammable substance is 1 psi overpressure (i.e. 15.7 psia) for vapor cloud explosions. Veolia Burnside Plant does not store any flammable substances listed in the rule in the threshold quantities required by the regulation; therefore, Veolia does not have a worst-case scenario for flammable substances.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nEndpoints for toxic substances are based on the ERPG-2. Toxic endpoints are listed in Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 68 (Table of Toxic Endpoints). Each of the regulated toxic substances at the Burnside Plant was reviewed to determine the substance with the greatest distance to an endpoint.\n\n\n\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint resulting from the instantaneous release of the contents of the oleum tank, a sulfur trioxide railcar with no shipping papers, or the sulfur trioxide piping would have an off-site impact, as determined by the U.S. EPA lookup tables contained in the OCA Guidance Document. Railcars are typically shipped out as soon as they are loaded.\n\n\n\nAlternative Releases\n\n\n\nAlternative release scenarios are those that are more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario. Alternative release scenarios for toxic substances should be those that lead to concentrations above the endpoint beyond the facility's fence line. The conditions considered for alternative release scenarios were that the release rate is dependent upon the scenario and active and passive mitigation systems are in place.\n\n\n\nToxic Substances\n\n\n\nHypothetical release scenarios have been identified for the regulated toxic substances, oleum and sulfur trioxide, in the sulfuric acid process. For oleum, it was assumed that a pipe breaks near the circulation pump. This area is not diked, so no mitigation was assumed. This release also has an off-site impact as determined by the use of the OCA Guidance and the 2010 census data provided in the MARPLOT 5.1.1 program and the Missouri Circ"

Because processes at the plant that are regulated by the EPA's risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA's PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nVeolia encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Burnside Plant's accident prevention program. One way that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program is our Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Committee. In addition, Burnside has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams have members from all areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Burnside Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/ exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For the sulfuric acid process area, Burnside has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level, composition) in a Standard Operating Conditions Manual. The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using state-of-the-art process controls and monitoring instruments, emergency relief systems, redundant power supply and safety systems, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nBurnside has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

These What If Checklists are used by team members with operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering experience. The Team evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Burnside periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.

New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nBurnside uses contractors to supplement its workforce.

Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nBurnside conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nBurnside has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.
