An effective safety program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, training programs, and other elements which impact the facility are all considered in the evaluation. The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated and strengthened to assure their effectiveness at each level.  \n\nSenior management is extremely committed to safety and implementation of safe procedures.  Through their support and dedication changes such as policies, procedures, equipment design and replacement, have been install and/or implemented throughout the company.  \nHCS values employees and their input.  Employee participation provides a cooperative participatory environment.  Employee participation presents the necessary flow of information from management to employees and from employees to management.  Management encourages a participatory work environment by visiting the facility, talking with employees, auditing, addressing audit recommendations and demonstrating through example and policy that they are committed to the esteemed employees at HCS.   \n\nA solid safety program married with a dedicated senior management staff aids in the prevention and mitigation of episodic chemical releases that could lead to a catastrophe in the workplace or surrounding community. To control these types of hazards, H.C.S. is confident that they have the necessary expertise, experience, judgment"

Currently, outdoor operations at the site include product loading and unloading and vehicle parking.  Indoor operations include freezing and refrigerated storage of product from customers.  Anhydrous ammonia (a regulated substance) is stored at the facility to aid in the refrigeration process.\n\nAccidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: \nThe HCS, Grand Forks North Dakota is regulated by the OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Part 68-Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (RMP) programs.  HCS employs a LOGIX computer control system of the refrigeration process.  The LOGIX system is configured to ensure that all refrigeration components are operating within their prescribed operating specifications.  It sounds an alarm if a component is not operating within its limits and notifies the Engineers.  It archives daily logs of the operating specifications as well.  The Chief Engineer or Engineer also performs daily, weekly, and monthly operating records of process equipment.  Records are maintained and reviewed by the DOCDE.  \nContinued documented maintenance of the equipment and annual inspections enhance the PSM and RMP programs.  HCS believes that continued taking an aggressive proactive approach to preventative maintenance ensures efficiency and safety. \nEngineers are specifically trained on the refrigeration system, the hazards associated with it, and their specific job tasks in regard to the process.  They are provided with renewal training in the following tradition: as needed, annually, biennial, or every three years as deemed by the DOCDE.  \n\nFive year accident history: \nThe HCS, Grand Forks North"

      "SummaryText": "Dakota facility has had no reportable offsite incidents during the past five years. \n\nEmergency Response Program: \nThe HCS emergency response program states that HCS employees are to take action only during an emergency.  Drills are scheduled at the facility with the local emergency responding agency.  Public notification is made through the Director of Corporate Development and Engineering (DOCDE), the General Manager, or designee.  An Emergency Action Plan has been developed, employees have been trained, and it has been implemented throughout the facility.  Several ammonia detection alarms are located throughout the facility.   If an unintentional release occurs the alarms sound alerting employees.  The alarming system also notifies the Chief Engineer/Engineer of the specific parts per million (ppm)-over 100ppm, at which time they immediately take action to locate where the detection occurred.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: \nHCS is committed to continued safety for personnel, facility, products, and off-site neighbors by; conducting employee orientation safety training, regular employee safety committee meetings, scheduling job specific training seminars and classes for employees, conducting and proceeding with recommendations from a process hazard analysis, implementing a five-year valve replacement program, upgrading equipment and technology and, annual review and certification of existing safety programs.  HCS believes that continued safety success is measured by employee\u00bfs increased knowledge and understanding of the work environment."
