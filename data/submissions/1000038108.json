An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) has been developed that includes coordination with local response agencies, procedures for employees to follow in the event of an accidental release of ammonia and a list of emergency phone numbers. Employees have been trained on how to use the plan and drills carried out annually.\n\n\n\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, FAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of FAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) `s high degree of commitment to public safety and service, FAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\n\n\n\n2.

The emergency response program\n\n\n\nEmergency response is discussed in Section 5 of the RMP. FAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. FAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nFAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows FAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of FAIR OAKS FARMS (EAST FACILITY) employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
