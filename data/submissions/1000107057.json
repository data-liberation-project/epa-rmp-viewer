The flexibility of the program allows Amick Farms to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential of exposing Amick Farms employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia.\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, Amick\nFarms is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of Amick Farms' high degree of commitment to public safety and service, they are taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing\nrecommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis."

A pre-startup safety review is also performed when the process safety information related to the system changes significantly.\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting,\nwelding, or burning.\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\nIncident Investigation: The procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.

Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.
