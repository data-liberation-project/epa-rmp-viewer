EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n1.1      Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n\n\nAt this facility, we store the following products (regulated substances):\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\nArsine\n\nHydrogen Chloride\n\nHydrogen Selenide\n\nPhosphine\n\nTitanium tetrachloride\n\n\n\nThe containers are unloaded from a delivery vehicle for various periods of time, and then are loaded and delivered to the final user. These products are considered hazardous under the Federal RMP regulation.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the facility.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for evacuation of the site, notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit. So that appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental releases.  \n\n\n\n1.2      The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the storage and the redelivery of a variety of compressed gases and chemicals to the end user. The regulated substances are primarily used by Air Products customers in the manufacture of electronic components.  The regulated substances are delivered to this facility in portable, DOT approved, shipping and storage containers. They are stored here until needed by the final user, at which time they are inspected prior to shipment and loaded onto a transport vehicle and d"

The regulated process is strictly the storage of the listed regulated substances in the containers in which they were received, until they undergo a pre-shipment quality assurance inspection and are loaded onto a delivery vehicle to be transported to the end user.\n\n\n\nFollowing is a listing of each regulated substance currently managed at our Santa Clara facility in amounts that exceed either the USEPA RMP threshold amount.  The listing provides each RMP regulated substance, its maximum container, the maximum total on-site inventory, and which program(s) it qualifies for.\n\n\n\nAmmonia has a maximum on-site inventory of 15,000 pounds and a maximum single container of 500 pounds.  Ammonia at Santa Clara is subject to RMP and PSM.\n\n\n\nArsine has a maximum on-site inventory of 7600 pounds and a maximum single container of 50 pounds.  Arsine at Santa Clara is subject to RMP and PSM.\n\n\n\nHydrogen Chloride has a maximum on-site inventory of 8,000 pounds and a maximum single container of 600 pounds.

Action items from the revalidation have been completed.  \n\n\n\n1.3      The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\nChemical specific prevention steps begin with the decision that all regulated substances would be on-site for storage only.  Further, the maximum cylinder for Arsine has been limited to reduce the potential magnitude of a release.  Products will be segregated by compatible hazards (pyrophorics, toxic hydrides, oxidizers, corrosives, flammables) to reduce the possibility of releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4      Five-year accident history:\n\n\n\nSince the initial operation of this facility in June of 2001, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of any of the covered chemicals that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n1.5      The emergency response program:\n\n\n\nAll facility employees have been trained to OSHA's HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level in order to identify the need for an initiated response.  Retraining is conducted annually. Employees will respond to emergencies by initiating emergency response alarm to outside agencies and evacuate the site. \n\nThe site employees are trained to handle small incidental leaks/spills that may occur but will evacuate and account for site personnel for uncontrolled releases. Access to the site will be managed until emergency responders arrive. The site employees will stand by to provide technical support to the responders. In addition, a regional Corporate ER Response Team is available for call out if the responders need hands o"

This information contains the names and numbers of responding outside agencies.  \n\nEmergency actions and response for both flammable releases and toxic releases have been coordinated with Santa Clara City Fire Department.  Periodic drills are held in order to review these activities with the responsible responding units.\n\n\n\n1.6      Planned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures.  No additional on-site modifications are currently planned.\n\n"
