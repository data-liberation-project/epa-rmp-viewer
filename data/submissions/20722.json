      "SummaryText": "Southeastern Mills, Inc. (Southeastern) is dedicated to maintaining employee and community health and safety.  Southeastern adheres to the requirements of all applicable federal and state environmental regulations and standards including EPA's Risk Management Program requirements.\n\nSoutheastern stores and uses chlorine in amounts greater than the RMP threshold quantity.  Chlorine is used in the flour milling process.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers. \n\nSoutheastern has performed a hazard assessment that includes an analysis of the impact a worst-case release of chlorine, as defined by the EPA, and an alternative release scenario would have on the surrounding community. The worst-case release scenario is defined as the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a ten minute period.  Such a release would result in a distance to the toxic endpoint of 1.2 miles.  The alternative release scenario was identified as the release for a faulty or damage container valve.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for the alternative release scenario was estimated to be approximately 0.2 miles.  \n\nSoutheastern has a comprehensive release prevention program which includes practices, policies, and procedures designed to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of chlorine.  The Prevention Program contains written operating procedures, an employee training program, an equipment maintenance and inspection schedule, safe operating parameters, management of change procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, and procedures for pre-startup review.\n\nSoutheastern will not respond to a release of chlorine.  The extent of Southeastern's involvement in response activities is limited to stopping the source of the release (if possible) and notifying local responders."
