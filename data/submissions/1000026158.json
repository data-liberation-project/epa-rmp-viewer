In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\r\nOur PSM/RM programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of highly hazardous materials as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, the PSM/RM programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur PSM/RM programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nOur PSM/RM programs contain the following major elements:\r\n\r\n\u00bf \tGeneral Company Policy\r\n\u00bf \tEmployee Participation\r\n\u00bf \tProcess Safety Information\r\n\u00bf \tProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\u00bf \tStandard Operating Procedures\r\n\u00bf \tTraining\r\n\u00bf \tContractor Qualifications\r\n\u00bf \tPre Startup Safety Review\r\n\u00bf \tMechanical Integrity Program\r\n\u00bf \tHot Work Permit\r\n\u00bf \tManagement of Change\r\n\u00bf \tIncident Investigation\r\n\u00bf \tEmergency Planning and Response\r\n\u00bf \tCompliance Audits\r\n\u00bf \tTrade Secrets\r\n\u00bf \tManagement System\r\n\u00bf \tHazard Assessment\r\n\u00bf \tFive Year Accident History\r\n\u00bf \tPreparing a Risk Management Plan (RMP)\r\n\r\nThe Corporate Director of Safety & Compliance is the program coordinator with overall responsibility to ensure that program goals and objectives are met and appropriate resources are available.

The Ammonia Refrigeration system is used in the production process for removing heat from the process through plate and frame heat exchangers. There are no evaporators in the refrigeration system.\r\n\r\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration system at Buffalo Rock in Birmingham, Alabama consists of 16 piston compressors manufactured by Vilter with HP ranging from 75 to 150. The compressors are located in 4 mechanical rooms feeding a common header (HSD) with a common suction (HSS).  There is a master accumulator on the suction side of the system to prevent the possibility of carry over.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 evaporative condensers external to the building elevated at the 2nd floor mezzanine level providing heat removal for the compressed NH3 (v). At this point there is a high pressure receiver tank to act as a buffer for the NH3 (l) entering the HPL common header feeding the heat exchangers via surge drums.\r\n\r\nOn the process side of the system there are 5 plate and frame heat exchangers, 2 falling film heat exchangers and one shell & tube heat exchanger, all being fed by surge drums with level control. All surge drums have dual SRV's and are connected to relief headers exiting through roof penetrations (roof vents are elevated to 15 ft above roof line with weather caps). There are 2 Viking positive displacement pumps used to circulate NH3 (l)"

At Buffalo Rock in Birmingham, AL a failure of the high pressure liquid receiver located outside of the building next to the evaporative condensers would be considered a worst-case scenario if a failure were to occur. This vessel has a volume of 60 ft3 with a maximum of 50% liquid ammonia at any one time, making a total release of 1,115 lbs of ammonia.  With a release of this magnitude the Toxic Endpoint is approximately 0.62 miles, which means the vapor would travel approximately 0.62 miles before reaching the 0.14 mg/L (200 PPM) level which is considered a safe level. The probability of a failure in this vessel system is very low due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\u00bf\tIndustry standards for the manufacture and quality control of pressure vessels;\r\n\u00bf\tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service;\r\n\u00bf\tPressure safety valves limit operating pressure in this vessel;\r\n\u00bf\tPM, inspection, testing and replacement of equipment is done by a licensed contractor;\r\n\u00bf\tAutomated level control system with daily operational inspections;\r\n\u00bf\tAlarms are in place to warn personnel of process upsets; and\r\n\u00bf\tThe emergency response plan and equipment at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Buffalo Rock involves the failure of one of the evaporative condensers with a total mass of 659 lbs of ammonia (see PSI Traking Log - Maximum Inventory Levels - Appendix I) at 150 psig. The total mass was used to compute the release quantity rather than guessing a possible rupture diameter (therefore the total mass was estimated to release in 10 minutes).
