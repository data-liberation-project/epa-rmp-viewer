Forklift Operation\n               a) All forklift operators, employees, and temporary workers are properly trained and informed of the dangers od ammonia as well as selected product suitable for stacking on top rack tier in freezer one.  The selected product allows forklift operators sufficient clearance between the top of the product and bottom part of ammonia piping.  Additionally, the operating skills of forklift operators are evaluated initially and every three years thereafter.  Operating deficiencies noticed during the evaluation or within the course of employment are addressed immediately with re-training.\n\n          2.  Contractor's policy\n               a) Contractor's are evaluated in terms of their knowledge of the ammonia refrigeration process and safety performance.  All contractors are supervised by Atlas Cold Storage refrigeration operators and General Manager to verify their compliance with PSM and other safet related guidelines.\n\n          3.  Process Safety Management Policy\n               a) Refrigeration operators must comply with all parts od the Atlas Cold Storage Process Safety Management Program.  The purpose of the PSM program is to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia.  It consists of fourteen elements that play a vital role in helping with the maintenance and operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n    B.  Emergency Response Policy\n          1.  It is the policy of Atlas Cold Storage to implement the requirements of the company's Ammonia Emergency Response Plan to minimize the risk of exposure to ammonia.  Company employees who have been trained in Ammonia Emergency Response will be cooperating with other trained responders to protect employees and the surrounding community from harmful exposures to ammonia.  In conjunction with this effort, trained refrigeration operat"

The stationary source and regulated substance handled at Atlas Cold Storage:\n     A.  Stationary source: Atlas Cold Storage, Engine Room.  Regulated substance handled: anhydrous ammonia.\n\nIII.  The worst case and alternative case scenarios including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit distances for each reported case.\n     A.  In the event of an anhydrous ammonia release, ammonia liquid or vapor would potentially expose persons to toxic levels that may adversely affect their health.  Using the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations, the following worst case and alternative case scenarios were established:\n          1.  Worst case scenario\n               a) The controlled pressure receiver (CPR), located in the engine room, has a normal operating level of 40%. The maximum permitted level is 70%. The maximum 70% level is strictly enforced by administrative controls and training.  The worst case scenario assumes that the CPR is 70% full at 75 psig and releases the equivalent of 8,050 lbs of ammonia in a period of 10 minutes and at a release rate of 443 lbs/min.  Assuming Atmospheric Class F and a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, in a rural setting, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 1.2 miles.  In the event of an ammonia release as described in the worst case scenario, the Ammonia Response Team and Plan will be implemented to control the release.\n\n          2.  Alternative case scenario\n               a) An ammoina charging hose ruptures during the charging process, a half inch opening in the hose allows a release rate of 200 lbs/min for 2 minutes, causing 400 lbs of ammonia  to be released.  Using Atmospheric Stability Class D with a moderate wind speed of 3 m/s, in a rural setting, the distance to the toxic end point is .3 miles.  Administrative controls s"

      "SummaryText": "et forth in the Ammonia Charging Operating Procedures require the refrigeration technician to stand by with the ammonia delivery truck driver during the entire ammonia charging process.  When the hose ruptures, the refrigeration technician closes the plant charging valve while the ammonia delivery truck driver stops the pump and closes the hose valve, limiting the release to 2 minutes and 400 lbs.  In the event of an ammonia release as described in the alternative case scenario, the Ammonia Response Team and Plan will be implemented to control the release.\n\nIV.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical specific steps at Atlas Cold Storage:\n     A.  The general accidental release prevention program consists of the following Process Safety Management elements:\n          1.  Employee Participation\n          2.  Process Safety Information\n          3.  Process Hazard Analysis\n          4.  Operation Procedures\n          5.  Contractors\n          6.  Training\n          7.  Hots Works Permit\n          8.  Mechanical Integrity\n          9.  Pre-Startup Review\n        10.  Management of Change\n        11.  Incident Investigation\n        12.  Emergency Planning and Response\n        13.  Compliance Audits\n\nThe combination of these elements help guard against a catastrophic release of ammonia.  Furthermore, Atlas Cold Storage is monitored 24 hours a day by ADT Security.  Management personnel who carry cell phones are immediatley notified of any refrigeration system failure or alarms.  In this way, system failures are addressed immediately to prevent a catastophic situation.  Lastly, each year and as needed, refrigeration operators are trained on system hazards, emergency response procedures, operating procedures and other system related issues.  In most cases, the training serves as a refresher for those who work directly with the system.  On-going training helps operators to effectively manage and operate the refrigeration system.\n\nV.

In the past five years, Atlas Cold Storage has not had a leak of the magnitude described in the RMP Standard 68.42 (a) and 68.42 (b).\n\nVI.  The Ammonia Emergency Response Plan at Atlas Cold Storage:\n     A.  The Ammonia Emergency Response Plan for Atlas Cold Storage consists of the following elements:\n          1.  Overview of Response Plan\n          2.  Facility Description\n          3.  Emergency Response Organization\n          4.  Emergency Response Procedures\n          5.

Emergency Preparedness and Planning\n          Each element (with the exception of Facility Description) carefully describes personnel involved and their responsibilities.  The plan is organized in a 3 ring binder and has tabs at each element's section.  It is located near the Ammonia Emergency Response Equipment and has been reviewed by management and the Company's Ammonia Response Team.\n\nVII.  Planned changes to improve safety at Atlas Cold Storage:\n          1.  Safety relief valves are being replaced every 5 years.\n          2.  An audit system will be established to periodically review operating and mechanical integrity procedures.\n          3.  Continued training among system operators and the Ammonia Response Team will be a priority to insure the proper operation and response of system processes and hazards.\n          4.  The Ammonia Emergency Response Plan will be periodically evaluated and revised to reflect any system, personnel, equipment or policy changes."
