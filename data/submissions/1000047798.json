It is our policy to adhere to applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency involving these materials were to occur, we will notify the Mid-County Fire District and the St. Louis County LEPC to respond to the emergency.  Our employees will evacuate and will not perform emergency response activities.  \n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  This facility packages consumer aerosol cans of various home and garden control products, filling each with a weighed amount of propellant gas.  The propellant gases used are propane and propane / n-butane mixtures.   Liquified propellants are stored in a tank farm consisting of two tanks with a nominal volume of 6,100 gallons and three tanks with a nominal volume of 18,000 gals.  Pumps and piping transfer liquified propellant from the storage tanks to two automated aerosol can filling rooms inside the manufacturing buildings.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  EPA's RMP and OSHA's PSM regulations apply to this site.  Our prevention program is designed to achieve and maintain compliance with these rules.  NFPA-58 applies to our propellant handling and storage facilities.  These requirements plus periodic assessments by our insurance carrier and the State of Missouri provide the guidance for operation and maintenance and independent reviews of our results.\n\n\n\nFive-year accidental history:  This site has not experienced an accident involving the covered process that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering-in-place.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event of an emergency involving our propellant system, the Mid-County Fire District and the St. Louis County LEPC will be notifie"

Representatives of the Mid-County Fire District visit our site on a regulate basis to ensure that they are familiar with the facility and prepared to respond if needed.  Our employees will evacuate in accordance with the Integrated Contingency Plan as the situation indicates.  The Emergency Coordinator or designees will provide information to the emergency response teams as requested.  The fire department and/or the police department will assist in notifying and evacuating surrounding businesses or residences if necessary.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  Improvements to the overall training program, process safety information management, and operating procedures are currently under way.  In addition, changes recommended from insurance, State of Missouri, and periodic internal compliance audits of this rule will be resolved and documented as appropriate. "
