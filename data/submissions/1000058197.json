In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety. These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\nOur EHS Programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, and manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. \r\n\r\n2.0\tGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nOur EHS programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n3.0\tPROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at Cargill Value Added Meats. Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process rather than a chemical process. Ammonia, the refrigerant is used as a heat transfer media to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment. The refrigeration cycle consists of four pr"

      "SummaryText": "ocesses: evaporation, condensation, compression, and expansion. Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerantt. Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy. The ammonia refrigeration cycle is in a closed system utilizing fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of vaporization must be applied to the liquid. Cargill Value Added Meats utilizes the ammonia refrigeration system for keeping plant processing areas at a constant temperature, preserving product, chilling water, and making ice. Since Cargill Value Added Meats exceeds the threshold quantity for ammonia, we will comply with a Program 3 prevention program. This will help to provide a safer environment for employees and the community, plus make the refrigeration system more efficient. All elements of the prevention program have been implemented.\r\n\r\n4.0\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nCargill Waco facility has had no reportable releases in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\n5.0\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nCargill Value Added Meats emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Response Plans (20 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).\r\nWe have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan. This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Waco Fire Department. We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire department.\r\n\r\n6.0\tPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nCargill is committed to continuous improvement of our policies, procedures, and facility. It is the intention of Cargill to remain an industry leader. New technology, training techniques, and equipment are continuously being added to our system."
