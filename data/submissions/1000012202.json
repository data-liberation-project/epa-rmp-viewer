If an accidental release should occur,the facility is prepared to\nwork with the local fire department,or other authorities,to mitigate any release\nand ,minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n      2.Facility information.\n    -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending  of fertilizers\n    for sale to farmers.\n            -Anhydrous ammonia is recived, stored, and distributed for direct application\n              as crop production nutrients.\n             -The maximum quanity stored would be 104,000 pounds in our two-12,000\n               gallon storage tanks. The maximum quantity  handled would be a truck/\n               transport load holding approximately 44,000 pounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n        3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternate scenario.\n              a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents\n                 or a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum \n                 quanitity released would be 54000 pounds, which represents the volume of \n                  the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The\n                  distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is  1.5 miles.\n          \n               b. The alternate release scenario based on the five year accident history (or\n                   the  most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a hose.The\n                   distance  to the endpoint ("
