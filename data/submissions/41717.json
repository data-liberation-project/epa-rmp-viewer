Ammonia is a colorless gas with a pungent odor that is an irritant to the eyes, nose and throat. It is normally shipped as a liquefied compressed gas and is present in portions of the refrigeration system as a liquid under pressure. Please refer to onsite data for ammonia quantities.\n\nIn order to protect its employees, the public, and the environment, the Monson facility has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.  The program is contained in a comprehensive web-based format designed to comply with WISHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM) found in WAC 296-67 and EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations found in 40 CFR Part 68. Monson's safety management website is a valuable tool through which Monson will be able to document any changes in safety or emergency procedures immediately upon their adoption.\n\nThe Monson plant has an emergency plan that addresses the response necessary for a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The compressor rooms are provided with ammonia detectors that sound an alarm if ammonia is detected.  The plant maintains a group of maintenance personnel who are trained and qualified to respond to leaks of ammonia.  The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Sel"

      "SummaryText": "ah police and fire departments and to the Yakima County emergency services to assist in the response. \n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia. Should there be an accidental release when no one was on the premises, this situation would be handled by computer controls.  Ammonia leak detectors are installed and the computer checks all areas where ammonia could possibly be.  When the computer detects ammonia it turns on the alarm and dials emergency numbers for appropriate refrigeration personnel. The employees in turn come down to the warehouse and fix the leak and shut off the alarm.\n\nMonson makes daily inspections of the process to determine if there are any potential problems; in addition, a monthly maintenance program is in place, carried out by Central Washington Refrigeration, the original equipment installer.\n\nAs a result of a recently-conducted Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) of the ammonia refrigeration system,  the compressor room ammonia sensors have been placed on a regular calibration schedule.  Wind socks have been installed at various locations so that they can be seen from any outdoor location at the plant.  If a release occurs, this will enable employees to quickly determine the wind direction during a release and to assemble in a pre-designated assemble location.  It will also provide a quick indication of whether the toxic cloud is traveling toward the populated area in Selah."
