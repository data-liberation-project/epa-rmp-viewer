The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years or as required by Management Of Change (MOC).  The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process.  For future PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Airgas action item database tracking system.

Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner.

The plan outlines action to be taken at the plant by personnel and visitor/contractors if an uncontrolled ammonia leak occurs, large or small.  Plant employee/operators will not respond directly to an ammonia leak and attempt to mitigate a catastrophic release.  Instead they will support and communicate with emergency responders, local response agencies, and provide outside agency notification in the event of an uncontrolled ammonia release.  The emergency action plan provides for the evacuation of Wilmington facility personnel and visitors.  The Airgas Wilmington facility has provided their emergency action plan to and coordinates the plan annually with a local Wilmington Fire Station and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Should an emergency involving the release of ammonia occur that will have off-site consequences, Airgas will contact the Fire Department and local support authorities, who will coordinate appropriate action for the affected community. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: \r\n\r\nSafety is an inherent part of the culture at Airgas and enhancements in safety and operations are actively discussed and supported.  The Wilmington CO2 production facility continues to review its processes for possibilities of improvement to the covered ammonia process, operational methods, and new technology to lower risk.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion of our most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), the Wilmington facility plans to: \r\n\r\n(1) Replace relief valve common header\r\n(2) Sparger water tank replacement and Ph monitor upgrade\r\n(3) Reciprocating compressor rebuild and packing upgrade\r\n\r\n\r\n."

The Wilmington refrigeration process can store up to approximately 16,000 lbs. (maximum intended inventory) of liquefied ammonia under pressure in the main receiver, all connected piping, compression, condensers and related processes vessels involved in the facility.  This covered process exceeds the listed regulatory threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs. for anhydrous ammonia and is subject to chemical accident prevention provisions.  \r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical:\r\n \r\nAnhydrous ammonia is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, presented in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68) (the RMP Rule Level 3).  Anhydrous ammonia is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration process safety management program presented in Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119 (OSHA PSM).  Additionally, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to California Code of Regulations, Title 19 \u00a7\u00a7 2735.1 to 2785.1.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The highly toxic nature of ammonia in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Airgas policy is to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations. Airgas has also implemented specific chemical prevention steps to help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following are examples of the types of safety features in place: (1) Rele"

These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate by the facility manager. \r\n\r\nTraining (TN): \r\n\r\nAirgas has implemented a training program for all employee/operators involved in the ammonia covered process.  All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topics as: general orientation, facility rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response. In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years.  Training is documented and tracked on a local training matrix and electronically in the Airgas University training system.\r\n \r\nMechanical Integrity (MI): \r\n\r\nAirgas has established mechanical integrity (MI) practices and procedures, based on preventative philosophy, to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves and vent systems, controls and interlocks, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.
