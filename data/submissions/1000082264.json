The Wilmington refrigeration process can store up to approximately 16,000 lbs. (maximum intended inventory) of liquefied ammonia under pressure in the main receiver, all connected piping, compression, condensers and related processes vessels involved in the facility.  This covered process exceeds the listed regulatory threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 lbs. for anhydrous ammonia and is subject to chemical accident prevention provisions.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical:\n\n \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, presented in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR Part 68) (the RMP Rule Level 3).  Anhydrous ammonia is also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration process safety management program presented in Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.119 (OSHA PSM).  Additionally, the anhydrous ammonia covered process is subject to California Code of Regulations, Title 19 ?? 2735.1 to 2785.1.  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:  The highly toxic nature of ammonia in the process makes it necessary for Airgas to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Airgas policy is to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.

(4) Facility and Environment - Contracted emergency response specialists. \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation (EP):\n\n \n\nAirgas has developed a written plan of action and Wilmington employee/operators are expected to participate in the accidental release prevention program (RMP/PSM/CalARP).  Employees are trained on and provided access to the ammonia refrigeration process safety information.  Specific actions of employee involvement in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation.  Employees participate in monthly safety meetings where process safety issues are discussed and corrective actions are developed, and they are involved in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are current, accurate and recommend any necessary changes.\n\n \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI): \n\n\n\nAirgas keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely.

A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is kept accurate and is readily accessible as part of the written employee participation. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): \n\n\n\nAirgas has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years or as required by Management Of Change (MOC).  The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process.  For future PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Airgas action item database tracking system.  The facility manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan to closure. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures (OP): \n\n\n\nAirgas maintains controlled written procedures that address various modes of liquefied and gaseous ammonia process operations, such as: (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal operations; (3) unit temporary operations; (4) unit emergency shutdown; (5) unit emergency operations; (6) unit normal shutdown and; (7) unit startup after turnaround or emergency shutdown.  Additionally, the emergency shutdown procedure includes conditions that will prompt a shutdown and identifies qualified and responsible operators to complete the steps in a safe and timely manner.

The plan outlines action to be taken at the plant by personnel and visitor/contractors if an uncontrolled ammonia leak occurs, large or small.  Plant employee/operators will not respond directly to an ammonia leak and attempt to mitigate a catastrophic release.  Instead they will support and communicate with emergency responders, local response agencies, and provide outside agency notification in the event of an uncontrolled ammonia release.  The emergency action plan provides for the evacuation of Wilmington facility personnel and visitors.  The Airgas Wilmington facility has provided their emergency action plan to and coordinates the plan annually with a local Wilmington Fire Station and Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  Should an emergency involving the release of ammonia occur that will have off-site consequences, Airgas will contact the Fire Department and local support authorities, who will coordinate appropriate action for the affected community. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety: \n\n\n\nSafety is an inherent part of the culture at Airgas and enhancements in safety and operations are actively discussed and supported.  The Wilmington CO2 production facility continues to review its processes for possibilities of improvement to the covered ammonia process, operational methods, and new technology to lower risk.  \n\n\n\nIn conclusion of our most recent Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), the Wilmington facility plans to: \n\n\n\n(1) Replace relief valve common header\n\n(2) Sparger water tank replacement and Ph monitor upgrade\n\n(3) Reciprocating compressor rebuild and packing upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n"

All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topics as: general orientation, facility rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response. In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years.  Training is documented and tracked on a local training matrix and electronically in the Airgas University training system.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity (MI): \n\n\n\nAirgas has established mechanical integrity (MI) practices and procedures, based on preventative philosophy, to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief valves and vent systems, controls and interlocks, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

This system is comprised of a group of corporate procedures, standards and forms under the life safety program.   Procedures in place include: (1) energy control; (2) safe work; (3) hot work; (4) confined space entry.  Plant personnel are trained on these safe work practices to ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed professionally and safely. \n\n\n\nContractors (CON): \n\n\n\nAirgas uses contractors to supplement its own work force when maintenance activities exceed the capabilities or time available for their own employee/operators.  Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by PSM/RMP regulations.  Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, and (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, prior to their beginning work.  Periodically contractors are evaluated to ensure that both their safety performance and training required for work on the ammonia refrigeration system meets Airgas safety standards.\n\n\n\nFi"
