If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Flat Rock Area Fire Protection District, Lawrence County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. The storage and handling system consists of storage tank(s), loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nThis facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe accidental release prevention program.\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of the Compressed Gas Association's (CGA's) American National Standards Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia (6th edition), commonly referred as to ANSI/CGA G-2.1 2014, as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.
