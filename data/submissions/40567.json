If an accidental release should occur, the Facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe emergency response plan for this site consists of the Evacuation Plan (when the evacuation alarm is given, employees travel upwind while avoiding the problem areas to the gate and then on to the assembly area where they have been instructed to wait for a supervisor to arrive and make a head count and issue further instructions); the county-wide emergency response plan with the San Joaquin County Fire Protection District as the designated emergency responder; and our provisions for notifying schools and government agencies in the event of a release which threatens to go off-site.\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, blending and sale of fertilizers, in addition to the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals, to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 18,000-gallon (gross water capacity) storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 78,000 pounds.\n\nThe Facility has implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.; the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Subchapter 1, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders\"; and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage "

In case of the release of anhydrous ammonia, facility personnel have been instructed to initiate the emergency shutdown of the process, evacuate all affected areas, notify their supervisors and other personnel who may be affected, and if so informed, evacuate the Facility. Office supervisor(s) will make the appropriate reports to Federal, State and local agencies. We will rely on the local Fire Department to perform the necessary Emergency Response activities; or, if necessary, we will contact an Emergency Response Contractor to perform the ER activities. In any situation, our personnel will give any assistance requested.\n\nSafety is an on-going process at the Facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the safety of operational conditions.  Any planned changes to the Anhydrous Ammonia process at the Facility are listed in the Facility's PHAs.\n"
