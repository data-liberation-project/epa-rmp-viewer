The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs.  Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The PSM Program is an integrated, holistic approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of WPS/Commercial to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  \r\n\r\nA \"Non Responding Facility\" policy has been adopted.  A Hazardous Material Business Plan consistent with Emergency Action Plan requirements has been developed.  The Staff communicate to the Fire Department and evacuate (shelter-in-place or evacuate off site) if there is a release situation or fire; Managers and employees would shepherd visitors (truck drivers receiving product or delivering product) if there is an emergency.  By effectively determining all persons are safe, the Fire Department can more swiftly manage the tactical part of a response.  It is the policy of the company that no-one shall respond to an emergency in a way that"

Pre-cooling, or the removal of field heat via Pressure Cooling is the facility's primary function.  The facility went into operation early in April, 2003.  This is a 5-year update (2018) of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as required by Federal and State Accidental Release Prevention (Fed/ARP and Cal/ARP) RMP Rules.  The facility has undergone little change in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nThe facility is located in an industrial area of Oxnard.  Anhydrous Ammonia CAS # 7664-41-7 is used as the refrigerant in the main refrigeration system.  This is a direct, mechanical refrigeration system which was installed according to the codes and standards locally adopted in 2002-2003.

WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to disassembly and moving of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific maintenance & repair tasks are is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into a computerized service call system. Tasks are tracked through this system.  Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, WPS/Commercial Cooler has reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced release potentials.\r\n\r\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \r\n\r\nAs noted above a comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established.  In California the program is in accordance with CCR 8, 5189.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  \r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one o"

The alarm system is continuously monitored via a third party security company.\r\n - The facility is equipped with a Closed-Circuit TV (CCTV) System.    \r\n - A sign-in/sign-out program is established.\r\n - Staff is trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for un-authorized personnel, suspicious activity, fires, releases or other hazardous/suspicious condition.   \r\n - Staff is trained in the fire and accident prevention benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\r\n - The refrigeration system is equipped with an ammonia-water diffusion system.
