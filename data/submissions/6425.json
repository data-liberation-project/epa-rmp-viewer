      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\nThe Rowlett Creek Water Recycling Center (WRC) is located in Garland, Texas, at 2500 E. Centerville Road.  The facility is owned and operated by the City of Garland.  This wastewater treatment plant uses chlorine and sulfur dioxide as part of the treatment process.  Currently, a maximum of 32,000 pounds of chlorine and 12,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide are maintained on the site.  No other toxic or flammable substances, as listed in 40 CFR 68, are stored or utilized at the facility.  \n\nSafety Policies\nThe City of Garland is fully committed to safety at the wastewater treatment plant.  The City recognizes the importance of safety in storing and using regulated toxic substances and has used the 40 CFR 68 requirements to further refine its safety program.  The City has also used this opportunity to strengthen its emergency response procedures between the plant and the Garland Fire Department.  The Fire Department is capable of responding to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide, should a release occur.  Finally, the City is committed to continuing to improve its risk management program for chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Rowlett Creek WRC.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nThe City's commitment to managing risks associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide is demonstrated by its excellent track record with these substances.  The Rowlett Creek WRC has not experienced an accident related to chlorine or sulfur dioxide within the past five years or at any time.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nAir dispersion modeling for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide produced the same radius of impact for both substances for the worst-case scenario.  Public receptors including residences, educational facilities, park and recreational facilities and major commercial/business/industrial buildings are located within the worst-case radius.  As required by the risk management regulations, the offsite consequence analysis also developed alternative-release scenarios fo"

The resulting radii of impact are therefore useful tools for emergency response teams in planning for and responding to emergency situations.\n\nPrevention Program Description\nThe City's prevention program represents the core of the day-to-day means by which accidental releases of regulated substances into the air will be minimized.  This component will be used primarily by plant personnel responsible for the operation and maintenance of regulated processes at the facility.  The prevention program will also become a useful tool in ongoing training of plant personnel. \n\nThe Prevention Program includes seven primary components:\n\n7 Safety Information: Up-to-date safety information has been compiled relating to regulated substances, processes, and equipment. Safety information will also be updated any time a major change occurs that would make the safety information inaccurate.\n\n7 Hazard Review: Regulated processes at the facility have been reviewed to identify potential hazards.  The results have been documented in a hazard review report.  Problems identified by the hazard review are being resolved in a timely manner.  \n\n7 Operating Procedures: Written operating procedures have been prepared providing instructions for safely conducting activities associated with regulated processes.  These procedures will also be updated should a major change in the handling or storage of regulated substances occur.\n\n7 Training:  Plant personnel responsible for operating regulated processes receive training in the processes.  Periodic refresher training is required.\n\n7 Maintenance:  Procedures have been implemented to ensure that the mechanical integrity of the process equipment is maintained.  Ongoing training of personnel responsible for maintenance is also required.  Process equipment for regulated substance processes will be inspected and teste"

The results of the audit will be documented and deficiencies corrected.\n\n7 Incident Investigation: Should an incident involving a release, or near release, of a regulated substance occur, it will be investigated promptly.  The findings of any such incident investigation will be used to improve the safety of the process.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe City of Garland has determined that the Rowlett Creek WRC will assume a non-responder status with respect to accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  The Garland Fire Department will instead be the appropriate local emergency response agency in such cases.  The Garland Fire Department has the necessary training to respond to chlorine and sulfur dioxide leaks.  Rowlett Creek WRC personnel have coordinated with the Fire Department to ensure that the facility is included in the community emergency response plan regarding response to a potential release.\n\nThe facility's employees have a significant role in the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide.  Should a release occur or be suspected, employees responsible for working with chlorine and sulfur dioxide will follow procedures for assessing the situation and attempting to safely stop the release using normal shutdown procedures.  Facility personnel will receive ongoing training in identification of potential releases, and in how to determine when emergency response personnel should be involved.\n\nRowlett Creek WRC will continue to work closely with the Fire Department to ensure that emergency response, should it become necessary, is efficiently and safely carried out.  Coordination may include:\n\n7 periodic meetings between operators and Fire Department emergency responders to discuss emergency response measures\n\n7 periodic inspections of the facility by Fire Department emergency respo"

As the wastewater treatment plant grows to meet the growing demands of the City, improvements in the chlorination and dechlorination processes will be considered to further manage risks associated with these regulated substances."
