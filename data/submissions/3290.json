Many of our employees are members of Local Emergency Planning Committees.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nThis facility manufactures, receives, stores, and ships chemicals which are primarily used in the electronics and semiconductor industry.  The regulated substances handled are anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide.\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical"

A written management system is in place with written operating and maintenance procedures.  The operations at this facility are ISO 9002 certified.  The managment system procedures contained in the ISO program ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency. \n \nFive-year accident history: \n\nThis facility has never had a release of anhydrous ammonia or ammonium hydroxide that resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact. \n  \nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equiped to respond offensively to accidental releases of the regulated substances and will coordinate with local emergency responders when there is a need for response.  Our employees regularly undergo training in emergency response activities.  This facility regularly invites the local fire department and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plant and gain familiarity with our operations.  This facility has a written emergency response plan that is updated regularly.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews and process hazard analyses.  We are currently in the process of building an enclosure around the anhydrous ammonia system to minimize potential offsite impacts of an accidental release.  We make ch"
