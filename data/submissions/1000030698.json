              "Description": "ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM - MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nShell maintains a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE) management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices that are related to the RMP Prevention Program?s elements. \n\n\n\nThese policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, that are designed to further enhance the site?s existing safety programs and procedures. The following is a summary of some of these measures: \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nShell encourages employee participation in all phases of its accident prevention management system.  There is a St. Rose Refinery Employee Participation policy that addresses participation requirements of various teams and committees, including Health & Safety Committees, Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) teams, and various safety awareness teams.  Participants include employees from Operations, Maintenance, Engineering & Technical Support and Management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure the safe operation of its processes.  The Process Safety Management policy requires operating departments maintain and update Process Safety Information (PSI) applicable to their processes.  Chemical-specific information is contained in material safety data sheets (MSDS), including properties, exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations.  Other PSI documents include, but are not limited to process drawings, descriptions of safe operating parameters and limits, chemical inventories, basis for process design, safeguarding, protective instrument and equipment construction information.  Many of the documents, including MSDS are electronically available to all refinery employees and Contractors.   The Process Safety Management policy also includes a summary table to assist employees in locating process safety information documents and drawings.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery maintains a comprehensive Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) program to identify and control hazards associated with its processes.  These include processes covered under one or a combination of: (1) RMP Program 3, (2) OSHA PSM, and (3) Shell internal criteria.  The refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members must include experienced employees with operating, maintenance, and engineering backgrounds who are familiar with the affected process.  The PHA team is chartered to identify the safety hazards in the process, evaluate the adequacy of existing safeguards in-place, determine the risk of the event occurring, and recommend additional accident prevention mitigations when the team believes such measures are necessary to reduce event risk.  All safety related PHA findings are risk ranked to ensure mitigation measures receive timely attention based on their risk priority.  All PHA findings are forwarded to local Management for review and resolution.  Safety related mitigations approved by Management begin immediately after Management review, starting with the highest risk scenarios.   When a final mitigation cannot be implemented within a reasonable time (e.g. hardware change scheduled to a unit maintenance turnaround), interim solutions such as administrative controls (i.e. operating and work practice changes) must be implemented to mitigate the risk.  PHA mitigations are tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  Process unit PHA's are revalidated every 5 years for the life of the process.  Written PHA reports are also retained for the life of the process.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery operating departments maintain written procedures to address a variety of operating modes such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide a reference to experience operators, as well as serve as a training tool for new operators.  Each PSM covered operating department must annually certify their procedures as current and accurate.  The management of change process is also used to ensure operating procedures are updated as necessary to reflect changes in the process unit.  Operating procedures are accessible to all St. Rose Refinery employees either electronically or in hard copy.\n\n\n\nOperator Training\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery implements a comprehensive training program for all operating, maintenance, and technical personnel.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their process.  In addition to classroom training, on-the-job training is accomplished by working with experienced operating personnel.  Along with routine operating practices, the training places a significant emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions (including shutdown).  Employees involved in operating a process must be qualified to perform the job on that process.  Operators must re-qualify on their jobs every three (3) years and work a pre-designated number of hours by job to maintain qualification.  Competency is assessed through a combination of methods such as written and oral tests, and demonstrating skills in the field.  The training program complements the written operating procedures to ensure operating employees are properly qualified for their job.  All training is documented and managed by the St. Rose Refinery Training Department.\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery routinely uses contractors to supplement its maintenance and technical workforce, particularly during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Since contractors may work on or near process equipment, Shell has procedures in place to ensure that contractors have the proper knowledge, skills, and training to perform their work in a safe manner prior to working on-site.  Contractor safety programs and performance are primary factors influencing the Contractor selection process.  Contractors are routinely monitored by a Contract Coordinator to ensure compliance with regulatory and Shell requirements.  Contractor safety performance is also part of St. Rose Refinery weekly safety statistics communications to employees and contractors. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features such as P&ID and other process drawings, operating and/or maintenance procedures, training and equipment are up to date and appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment in-service.  This review provides an additional check to ensure construction is in accordance with design specifications, that all supporting systems are operationally ready, and personnel are appropriately trained on the modification.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain the integrity of pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps, and critical instrument systems.  The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity program include (1) training for process maintenance activities, (2) ongoing inspection and testing of process equipment, (3) correction of identified equipment deficiencies as appropriate, and (4) quality assurance in construction, installation and spare parts.  Maintenance personnel are trained on the safety and health hazards in their work areas, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to ensure that the process equipment functions as intended and that the equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. acceptable wall thickness for pressure vessels).   If a deficiency is identified, the operating department must correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service. The appropriate mechanical integrity support group (i.e. Pressure Equipment Integrity, Mechanical, Electrical, or Instrumentation) review equipment use and determine any necessary actions to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits \n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples include: (1) the control of entry and exit of support personnel in a process area, (2) equipment lockout and tagout procedures to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening process piping or equipment, (4) a permit process to control hot work, and (5) a policy and permit process to ensure adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These safe work practices, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its processes.  This system requires that changes to equipment hardware, chemicals, operating variables (including critical process operating conditions), procedures, operating staff and any other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, all personnel affected by a change must be provided the necessary notification and training.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery promptly investigates incidents resulting in, or could have reasonably resulted in fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and the investigation results are reviewed with all potentially affected employees and contractors.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nRMP Compliance Audit\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery maintains a comprehensive audit program to ensure accident prevention policies and procedures are in place and functioning properly.  Compliance audits consist of: (1) OSHA PSM/EPA RMP compliance audits conducted every three years, (2) external compliance audits by Shell's Corporate Office on a three year cycle, and (3) internal management system audits conducted annually to evaluate the accident prevention system for each unit.  Employees ranging from hourly, engineering and technical, and management personnel participate as audit team members in the internal audit process.  The audit team(s) develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and audit findings are retained for six (6) years.\n\n\n\nSite-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery?s accident prevention program manages potential hazards to ensure continued safe operation.  These prevention steps help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human error.  The St. Rose Refinery has various safety features to: (1) detect,  (2) contain and control, and (3) mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\n\n1. Release detection\n\n- Process alarms;\n\n- Operator surveillance; and\n\n- Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment.\n\n2. Release containment and control\n\n- Relief systems designed to prevent equipment overpressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare);\n\n- Dikes to contain liquid releases;\n\n- Redundant equipment (i.e. back-up firewater pump); and\n\n- Control valves to allow isolation of the process.\n\n3.   Release Mitigation  \n\n- Area firewater monitors;\n\n- Mobile emergency response equipment; and\n\n- Trained emergency response personnel.\n\n",

These operational changes will allow the facility to accept higher sulfur content crude streams, which will impact the facility's applicability status with respect to the requirements outlined in 40 CFR Part 68.  The refinery's wastewater treatment system will collect wastewater with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentrations potentially in excess of 1% by weight.  It is unknown at this time whether actual H2S concentrations in the wastewater will exceed the 1% RMP threshold; however, in order to ensure compliance with RMP requirements, the facility has elected to register as an RMP-covered facility until actual concentration data can be obtained to verify concentrations are below the threshold.  No other process at the refinery is subject to RMP requirements and H2S is not thought to have the potential to accumulate in concentrations greater than 1% in any other location at the refinery.  Several of the refinery's product sour streams will contain H2S; however, based on the material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and refinery personnel process knowledge, these concentrations should remain below the 1% threshold. \n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS (OCA) SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis (OCA) was performed on the potential worst-case scenario (WCS) and alternative release scenario (ARS) involving toxic mixtures at the facility.  The WCS is considered to be unrealistic because it does not reflect actual operating conditions nor allow credit for all mitigations in-place.  On the other hand, the ARS is a more realistic scenario which takes into account actual operating conditions and applicable mitigations.  \n\nThe following are brief summaries of the WCS and ARS at the facility, including information on mitigation control measures to reduce potential offsite impacts.  All OCA release modeling was p"

Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census Landview&reg; VI Environmental Mapping Software (2003).\n\n\n\n1. Toxic Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe \"process\" containing the largest volume of H2S is the wastewater surge tank (TK-8554), which has a maximum storage capacity of 12,000 barrels of water.  The wastewater surge tank is located at latitude 29.95238?N and longitude 90.32835?W.  The surge tank will only reach maximum capacity in a heavy rainfall event and, in this case, the H2S concentration of the wastewater would be significantly lower than in normal operations.  Therefore, as a worst-case scenario, the surge tank is projected to contain 10,000 barrels (420,000 gallons) of wastewater with a conservative H2S concentration of 2% by weight.  Assuming a density of 8.34 pounds per gallon (lbs/gal) of water, the total quantity of H2S gas in the surge tank is calculated to be 70,056 lbs.  The catastrophic failure (worst-case scenario) of TK-8554 results in a toxic endpoint distance of 12.0 miles (19.3 kilometers).\n\nThis worst-case scenario would have wide-ranging offsite impacts with an estimated impacted population of 332,544 people.  The toxic plume has the potential to cover 452.4 square miles and affect over 140,000 residences.  There are multiple hospitals and schools in the neighboring area that could be impacted by this release.  The potential impact area includes several recreation areas, including Lafreniere Park, Delta Park, Ama Park, and Lions Playground.  Depending on the wind direction at the time of the release, potentially impacted cities could include the vast majority of Kenner, Metairie, and western portions of New Orleans, Louisiana, if the wind is from the west at the time of the release.  Impacted areas if winds were from the east at the time of release would include the cities of Nor"

Furthermore, Bayou Segnette State Park and the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve, along with multiple canals, rivers and lakes, including Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, could be impacted by this accidental release.\n\n \n\n2.   Toxic Alternative Release Scenario\n\n\n\nA probable alternative H2S release scenario is an overflow of the wastewater surge tank due to an extreme rainfall event, such as a hurricane.  Since the majority of the water entering the surge tank would be rainwater, the H2S concentration would be diluted; thus, a concentration of 1% by weight H2S is assumed for modeling purposes.  This scenario could result in an estimated 1,000 barrels of water to overflow releasing approximately 3,500 lbs of H2S gas over a period of 30 minutes (116.67 lbs per minute) before shutdown procedures could be initiated.  The endpoint distance calculated as a result of this release is 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers).  Approximately 1,094 people and 355 residences could be impacted in the event of this release, which covers an area of 0.8 square miles.

All safety related PHA findings are risk ranked to ensure mitigation measures receive timely attention based on their risk priority.  All PHA findings are forwarded to local Management for review and resolution.  Safety related mitigations approved by Management begin immediately after Management review, starting with the highest risk scenarios.   When a final mitigation cannot be implemented within a reasonable time (e.g. hardware change scheduled to a unit maintenance turnaround), interim solutions such as administrative controls (i.e. operating and work practice changes) must be implemented to mitigate the risk.  PHA mitigations are tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  Process unit PHA's are revalidated every 5 years for the life of the process.  Written PHA reports are also retained for the life of the process.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe St. Rose Refinery operating departments maintain written procedures to address a variety of operating modes such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide a reference to experience operators, as well as serve as a training tool for new operators.  Each PSM covered operating department must annually certify their procedures as current and accurate.
