Its warehouse and storage facility located at 1224 E Washington, McAlester, Oklahoma, stores various chemicals for resale. The chemicals are purchased from manufacturers or their representatives, brought to the facility, unloaded, stored temporarily and reloaded for shipment to the customer. The following are key elements of the RMP plan:\n\n\n\n(A)  The stationary sources and the regulated substances handled are:\n\nCompressed Chlorine Gas\nThis product is handled by Southwest Chemicals Services, Inc. in  150 pounds pressurized cylinders. The cylinders are received via truck and unloaded using a forklift. The full cylinders are stored by securing them with chains to storage cradles made of steel. For delivery to clients, the cylinders are loaded using a forklift onto the bed of a truck on which they are secured with straps during transport. \n\nCompressed Sulfur Dioxide\nThis product is handled by Southwest Chemicals Services, Inc. in standard 150 pound pressurized cylinders. The cylinders are received via truck and unloaded using a forklift. The full cylinders are stored by securing them with chains to storage cradles made of steel. For delivery to clients, the cylinders are loaded using a forklift onto the bed of a truck on which they are secured with straps during transport.\n\n\n(B) In the highly unlikely event (worst-case scenario) of a mechanical failure of one of the cylinders containing the compressed gas, a release of the contents of the cylinder may occur and have offsite consequences. An alternative scenario involves a release of the compressed gas through a 1/4-inch in diameter hole in the cylinder wall caused by corrosion. Minimum offsite consequences may result from such an alternative release scenario. \n\n(C) Southwest Chemicals Services, Inc. has in place an accidental release prevention program, which, among others, includes Process Safety Information, Process Hazard "

Operating Procedures review and enhanced training of personnel in the safe handling of all chemical products is a continuing goal of this facility.  Forklift operations and truck-loading training ongoing. As technology and operation changes occur, additional training and improvement in loading equipment will be implemented."
