      "SummaryText": "I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThis document contains all of the information necessary for the MSD Baumgartner Wastewater Treatment Lagoon (Baumgartner) to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 68 ?Risk Management Program?.\n\nII. RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nBaumgartner uses chlorine for wastewater treatment.  Chlorine is used to disinfect the treated wastewater.  Chlorine is a regulated substance under 40 CFR 68 and is a potential health hazard if not handled properly.  Baumgartner adheres to all applicable Federal, state, and local rules and regulations to ensure a safe environment within the facility as well as for the surrounding community.  Access to the chlorine area is restricted to certified operators, authorized contractors, and the Mehlville Fire Department (the primary responder in the event of an accidental release).\n\nThe Baumgartner Treatment Lagoon is an unmanned facilty. In the event of an accidental release, the chlorine alarm will sound causing an automaitc dialing system to contact the appropriate MSD personnel.  The primary emergency responder in the event of an accidental release, is the Mehlville Fire Department. Procedures are in place for notification of the Mehlville Fire Department (primary responder), the LEPC and the St. Louis County HAZMAT team.\n\nIII. PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Baumgartner Treatment Lagoon in Mehlville, Missouri (south St. Louis County) treats wastewater for the surrounding urban community.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process as a disinfectant.  The chlorination process occurs during the months of April through October.  Typical chlorine consumption rate is approximately 350 - 500 pounds per day.  The North American Industrial Classification System code (NAICS code) for the primary process at this facility is 22132.\n\nTypically, seven 1-ton containers of chlorine are stored on site at any given time.  The on-line chlorination system includes seven, manifolded 1-ton containers in t"

      "SummaryText": "hree sets of two, and one additional container, with an automatic switchover valve between the three sets of pairs.  All containers are housed inside the chlorination building located on the north side of the plant. Empty chlorine containers are stored in a protected area outside the chlorination building. \n\nThe 1-ton chlorine containers contain a regulated substance under 40 CFR 68.  The chlorine threshold for triggering applicability of 40 CFR 68 is 2500 pounds.  The maximum quantity of chlorine stored on-site at any one time is 16,000 pounds.  Since this exceeds the threshold limit, Baumgartner is subject to 40 CFR 68 as a Program 2 facility. \n\nIV. WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENERIOS\n\n IV.1       Worst-case Scenerio\nFor Baumgartner Treatment Lagoon, the worst-case scenerio is the loss of 2000 pounds of chlorine in 10 minutes from a 1-ton container located outside of the chlorination building.  Since the facility is located in a populated area, the worst-case scenerio would affect nearby public receptors. \n\nThe chlorine worst-case scenario was developed using EPA?s RMP*COMP for distances to endpoint for chlorine.  The 3 ppm endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline, Level ? 2 (ERPG-2) and occurs at a distance of 1.3 miles.  The estimated affected residential population is 9,718 people.  The population estimate for the worst-case scenario is based on data generated using LandView 5 and 2000 Census data.\n\n IV.2      Alternative Release Scenerio\n\n Chlorine\nThe alternative release scenario examined involves the release of chlorine due to a flashing liquid release through a 0.28? diameter rust hole at the liquid level of the 1-ton container. Passive mitigation is considered in this case as the 1-ton container is assumed to be housed in the chlorination building. The chlorine alternative release scenario was developed using EPA?s RMP*COMP to obtain the distance to endpoint.  The 3 ppm endpoint is defined by the US EPA as the"

According to EPA?s RMP*COMP, for distances shorter than 0.1 miles, 0.1 miles is used.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine does not impact residences (estimated affected residential population is 0 people) or environmental receptors.  Although the facility is located in an urban area, the plant is surrounded by an unpopulated buffer zone greater than 0.1 mile.\n\nV. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with EPA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all Federal, state and local codes and regulations.  The plant continually conducts inspections to ensure the system is intact and operating correctly.  These inspections ensure that the worst-case and alternative scenerios have a minimal chance of occurring. \n\nThe plant has developed a prevention program for chlorine to meet the Program 2 requirements of the RMP rule.  The prevention program was developed to comply with 40 CFR 68, to ensure the safety of the employees, and to ensure the safety of the surrounding community.  The program covers a compilation of safety information, periodic conduct of hazard reviews, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance auditing and incident investigation. \n\nVI.      FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n The review of this facility?s accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1999 ? June 21, 2004.  During this time period, there have been no releases at this facility as defined by 40 CFR Part 68.42(a).\n \nVII.     EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n As mentioned earlier, in Section 1.0, the Baumgartner Treatment Lagoon is not a primary emergency responder in the event of an accidental release, but the lagoon is included in the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  Procedures are in place for notification of the Mehlville Fire Department (primary responder), the L"
