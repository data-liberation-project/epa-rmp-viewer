      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nThe BOC Gases Fostoria facility, owned and operated by The BOC Group, Incorporated is located at 405 East Zeller Road; Fostoria, Ohio. The management and employees of the Fostoria facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the community and the environment.\n\nThe facilities primary operation is the separation of air into there main components.  A support process to this operation involves the use of ammonia.  Ammonia is received and stored in a 18,000 gallon tank.  The ammonia is then sent to a Dissociator where the ammonia is separated into it's component elements of hydrogen and nitrogen gas.  The process of separation occurs when ammonia gas flows through a dissociator where separation (cracking) is accomplished over a catalyst at 1750 degrees Fahrenheit.  The cracking reaction is an endothermic reaction with no potential of runaway.  From the dissociator the cracking products, hydrogen and nitrogen gas, are cooled by a cross-exchanger and further cooled by use of an aftercooler.  The final product, (H2-N2) is fed to a argon purification skid.\n\nThe worst-case scenario, based on the EPA's definition for a toxic gas release, would be the rupture of the 18,000 gallon Ammonia Tank. The results would be a maximum release of 52,000 lbs of ammonia over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe endpoint of 0.14mg/L (EPRG-2 Level) was determined to be 4.0 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The weather conditions used were a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec., Stability Class F, an air temperature of 77 degrees F and rural topographical terrain.\n\nThe impacted area would affect 6100 residents and several special receptors which includes one hospital (Fostoria Common) and nine schools based on the 1990 US Census data obtained from \"Land"

      "SummaryText": " View III\".  Many business and industries are also within the endpoint.  No passive/active mitigation or administrative controls were considered in this assessment.\n\nThe alternative release, or more probable, scenario which was determined involved the uncoupling of the 2\" fill hose during filling of the tank from a road trailer. This release would result in the 10 second release of 15 gallons (77 lb) of liquid anhydrous ammonia prior to the activation of the emergency shut-off valve. The Excess Flow Valve would shut-off the liquid pump along with the activation of the Emergency Shut-off Valve by the driver, resulting in termination of the release.\n\nThe release endpoint of 0.14mg/L (EPRG-2) was determined to be 0.17 miles using the RMP*Comp. (1.06) software. The Weather conditions used were a wind speed of 3.0 meters/sec., Stability Class D, and air temperature of 77 degrees F and rural topographical terrain.\n\nThe affected area would include several public receptors and businesses based on actual observations. They would include an American Legion Hall, a Bowling Lane and several smaller businesses. No residents were affect by this scenario.\n\nPassive and Active Mitigation systems in place that would reduce the likelihood of a release or the release itself. These include check valves in the fill lines, Excess Flow Valves and Emergency Shut-off Valves on the Delivery vehicle,  a preventive maintenance schedule for the system, safeties and UT testing of the tank.\nThere were no reportable accidents in the last five years.\nThe facility has developed a comprehensive prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The program utilizes state-of-the-art technology, sound engineering practices, administrative controls and active employee participation.  Employees serve on task groups and teams in developing and maintaining risk management program elements.  They are frequently consulted concerning the various aspects of the program and ways to continual"

This information was utilized to develop a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) which assists management and employees in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of releases of ammonia. The PHA focuses attention on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, (routine and nonroutine), and external factors that might impact the process by identifying potential failure points or failure modes in the process. The PHA was review and updated on May 12, 1998 and will be updated at least every 5 years. \n\nDetailed 0perating procedures exist which describe tasks to be performed, dates to be recorded, operating conditions to be maintained, samples to be collected, and safety and health precautions to be taken.  The procedures were reviewed/approved to ensure they are technically accurate by employees, managers and personnel with the technical expertise/knowledge of the process.  The operating procedures were review on May 12, 1998 and are annually reviewed/revised as necessary to reflect current operations.\n\nEmployees are thoroughly trained, including maintenance and contractor employees.  The training meets and exceeds the requirements as outlined in OSHAs hazard communication standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  Training includes operating procedures, safe work practices, emergency procedures (including alarms), special assignments, evacuation and emergency response; safety rules and procedures; routine and nonroutine work authorization; and other pertinent process safety information.

Employees are encouraged to actively participate.  The employees  are periodically evaluated to ensure they posses the necessary skills and knowledge via written tests, observation and/or oral interviews. The training program was last reviewed on May 12, 1998.\n\nA contractor screening process has been established and is designed to ensure that contractors hired or used can accomplish their assigned tasks without compromising the safety and health of employees and the public.   The screening program involves obtaining information on the contractor's safety performance, including injury and illness rates, and experience.  In addition, the contractor's safety performance, job skills, knowledge, and certifications (such as pressure vessel welders) are also verified. The contractors safety procedures were last review in January 1999.  \n\nPreStart-up Safety Reviews (PSSR) are used for new or modified processes to improve the design and construction of the process from a reliability and quality stand point.  The PSSR recommendations are resolved before final installations are complete. Other items completed prior to initial process startup include piping and instrument diagrams, operating procedures, and ensuring operating personnel are fully trained.  The initial startup and normal operating procedures are fully evaluated as part of the PSSR to assure a safe transfer into the normal operating mode for meeting the process parameters. The last PreStart-up Safety Review was conducted on May 12, 1998.\n\nAn on-going mechanical integrity program (maintenance) is used to ensure safe process operations.
