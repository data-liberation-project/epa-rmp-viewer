      "SummaryText": "\n\nThe regulated process at the Ringgold GA facility is acetylene cylinder filling.  Acetylene is transported to our site on trailers in which a number of cylinders are connected via manifolds.  These trailers become the source for the acetylene trans filling process. Individual acetylene cylinders are trans filled in the plant on manifolds.  Each cylinder is individually processed via a weigh in and a weigh out procedure.  Cylinders are then staged for distribution.  While staged for distribution and for other reasons while on site, cylinders are stored within fire walls used to segregate quantities of product. \n\nSenior management is dedicated to operating the facility safely and maintaining compliance to PSM/RMP regulations.   Resources have been identified at the local level as well as within the region for appropriate implementation and maintaining a safe operation.  \n\n\n\nAirgas USA, LLC manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of the facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.                                                                                                                                               The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous materials unit so that the appropriate measures can be taken by the local emergency responders to control accidental release.\n\nThere have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of product that have resulted in deaths, injuries, or property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nAt this time, there are no planned changes"
