We are located in scenic Lancaster County Pennsylvania , surronded mainly by farmland.  For this reason there is only approximately 150 people living within our established Worst case release scenario endpoint.\n\nPrior to this year, we have not experienced any accidents resulting in releases that may harm the environement in our history of operation.  This is due to our aggressive Preventative Maintenance Program that results in routine checks of all vital components of the system and their pressures and/or temperatures.  We aslo have an weekly inspection program that assures that there are no signs of equipment, component or piping failure within the system.  However, we did on 01/05/99 have a pump failure, on a pump that was scheduled for replacement.  This resulted in a loss of ammonia that was contained on-site with no harm to the environment.  Since then, the pump has been replaced and no further problems have occurred.\n\nWe also have Ammonia sensors that detect an ammonia leak which sounds an alarm.  This is back up with manual pull stations for our alarm system, or numerous locations where calls could be made for assistance through the Emergency 911 System.  Other in-house measures in place are an Hazardous Incident Response Team, trained at the Hazardous Materials Technician Level to handle any potential significant scenario's outisde of what the Maintenance department can routinely handle.  We are also investigating installing a retaining pool to hold any lost liquid so that it may be neutralized and/or removed.  He have worked with the LEPC since 1988 to devlop a contingency plan for releases involving the local fire department, Lancaster County Hazardous Materials Team, as well as, our on-site expertise.\n\nIn addition to these measures currently in place, we are continually looking for new methods to further reduce the possibility of a release which may cause poten"
