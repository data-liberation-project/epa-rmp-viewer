The facility is complying  with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and EPA Risk Management Program rule.  The purpose of these regulations is to ensure that the covered rocess (ammonia refrigeraton) is designed, operated and maintained safely.Complience with these regulations helps reprevent ammonia releases from the process.  Additionally, these regulations required development of procedures to minimize releases of ammonia in the event that they dooccur, and to outline appropiate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.  VersCold Cascade, Inc Company has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operations and maintenance.  This was accomploshed through the development of a PSM Team comprised of Operations, Maintenance, Safety and Engineering personnel, augmented by the support of refrigeration contractor personnel.  The PSM Program has been incorported as bith policy, and most important, procedure in every day operations and maintenanc of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The VersaCold Cascade, Inc. Company Emergency Evacuation and Contingency Plan has been developed in concert with the Darien Fire Department and the Walworth County Emergency Respns Agency.  The plan addressed fire, explosion, spills or release of toxics, severe weather and othe critics.  The plan details response actions by the VersaCold Cascade, Inc. Company Emergency Response Team for such emergencies, safety and emergency equipement, communications responsibilities, and coordination with off-site responses.  The plan includes Emergency Response of Anhydrous Ammonia, specifically addressing incidents involving ammonia refrigeration.  The VersaCold Cascade, Inc.

      "SummaryText": "acility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as  a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of finished products.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most storage facilities.  Anhydrous ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures and atmospheric pressure, but it is utiliezed in the refrigeration process as a gas liquefied under pressure.  VersaCold  Cascade, Inc. Company operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration sustem within the facility.  The VersaCold Cascade, Inc. operates one distinct ammonia refrigeration system within the facility.  The VersCold Cascade, Inc. Company refrigeration systems are designed to provide the following:  *operating flexibility (through availiability of multiple operating equipment combinatins): *ecomony and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of coolong required) *optimal safety performance (through the use ammonia liquid pumps, utilizing instead the pressure differentials established in the system to move liquid refrigerant): and * consistanly of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require.  VersaCold Cascade Company has developed its worst case release scenario assuming that the normal charge in the receiver  operated at 100% capacity, ruptured, releasing 1980 pounds of ammonia within the Compressor Room.  The migrated release rate of ammonia has been calculated to be approximately 204 pounds per minute.  This release has a toxic end-point of approximately 0.795 miels.  This scenario was developed utilizing EPA's Risk management Guidelines it should be note that such a release is highly improbable, as th VersaCold Cascade, Inc.

VersaCold Cascade, Inc.  Company has developed its alternative release scenario assuming a safety releif  valve has discharged at a rate of 43.5 pounds per mnuted for 10 minutes.  This release has a toxic end-point of .22 miles.  Ther have been no releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system during th past five years.  The VersaCold Cascade, Inc. Company emergency rsponse program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emgency response and maintain a writetn response plan.  The plan is coordined with the Walworth County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and th Darien Fire Department.  We conduct periodic drills for the implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility, and anticipated incresed participatin with the LEPC and the Fire Department."
