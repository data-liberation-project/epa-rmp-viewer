Our operation is completely underground in caves.  We utilize Ammonia (Anhydrous) as a refridgerant for the facility.  The total amount of Ammonia that we have on site is 40,000 pounds at any given time.\n\nOur system is that which enables us to keep all the Ammonia self contained in one central location of the facility.  This area is known as the Engineer Room and has a ventilation system that takes any Ammonia release directly outside above the facility.  This room is self contained and with the most updated emergency shut-off system available at the time to assure complete isolation of Ammonia in case a release should ever occur.\n\nCommercial Distribution Center, trains all personnel on a continual basis of what to do in case of an Ammonia release within the facility.  Our plant engineer and warehouse manager are trained to the First Responders Awareness Operational Level  in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120.\n\nShould there be a case where there has been a release of Ammonia, the plant engineer would isolate the release and notify our outside emergency response firm to report to facility.  Our contracted response firm is Environmental Technology and Services of St. Joseph, Missouri.  They would respond to facility and mitigate the release.\n\nThe worst case scenario that could occur would be that of a result of a fire or collapse of the cave.  Thus releasing the capacity of 40,000 pounds of Ammonia into the air.  In this case, Commercial Distribution would implement our emergency response plan and isolate the area and wait for Environmental Technology and Services to arrive on site to mitigate release.\n\nThe most likely scenario that would happen would be that of equipment failure thus release a small quanity of "
