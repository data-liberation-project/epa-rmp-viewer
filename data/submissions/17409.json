      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of this facility to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\n\nThis facility is used to transfer bulk liquid chemical products from railcars into tank trucks.  The tank trucks then transport the products to customer sites.  The two chemical products being transferred are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI).  Their trade names are Rubinate TDI and Rubinate M, respectively.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is failure of one 21,000-gallon railcar resulting in a toxic vapor cloud.  The resulting distance to the endpoint is 0.1 miles.  The alternative release scenario is a break in an appoximate 5 inch diameter hose connection, leading to a 10-minute release of approximately 1,000 gallons of product.  Although there are commercial receptors within the distance to the endpoint, there are no residential receptors within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  Material transport and transfer operations are maintained in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT) and other state laws.\n\nThe transfer activities of this facility were first initiated in September 1999, and since that time there has not been an accident involving either of the chemcal products that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving either of these chemical products, the facility policy is to notify the Warren Fire Department and Kemper Environmental (spill contractor) and request that they respond to the emergency."
