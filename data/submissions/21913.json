Describe the accident release prevention and emergency policies\n\nIt is the intent of Ice Cream Partners USA to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment. Ice Cream Partners will also comply with all federal, state, and local laws. The plant manager has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key components in the plant safety and health program. Ice cream Partners exercises many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia. These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the system, a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to upsets in the system.\n\nThe PSM/RMP Coordinator is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n \n\n\nB.    Stationary source and regulated substances Handled\n\nIce Cream Partners Bakersfield Plant produces ice-cream products for sale to the public. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to freeze ice-cream products and also to operate the plant air-conditioning. The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 101,000 pounds. Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Bakersfield plant.\n\n\n\nc.    Summary of Worst-case and Alternative release scenarios\n\nThe Worst-Case toxic release scenario at the Bakersfield Plant involves the release of 34,276 pounds of ammonia over a 35 minute period due to the failure of the Hi"

      "SummaryText": "gh Pressure Receiver (HPR), The HPR receiver has the capacity to contain a maximum ammonia inventory of 48,967 pounds at 100%. But because of written administrative procedures and mechanical controls in place at the plant to limit the amount of ammonia stored in the High Pressure Receiver to 70% (34,276 pounds) or less. The release rate also assumes that the enclosed engine room would limit the amount released to the atmosphere. Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe Alternative toxic release scenario at the Bakersfield Plant involves the release of 18,649 pounds of ammonia over 11 minutes due to a pressure relief valve opening. The release duration was assumed to be limited by the response of the Utility Mechanics to the ammonia detector in this line and access platforms to the dual pressure relief valve.Under alternative release conditions, the resulting vapor cloud could have off-site impacts.\n\nThe Worst-Case and alternative toxic release scenarios are unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n1) Industry standards are followed for the design and manufacture of the equipment in the ammonia\n    refrigeration system.\n2) The ammonia receivers are well protected from vehicular traffic.\n3) Pressure safety valves on the ammonia receivers should limit any pressure increases inside the \n    receivers.\n4) Ammonia detectors should readily detect releases from the pressure relief valves on the ammonia \n    receivers.\n5) Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.\n6) The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the \n     ammonia refrigeration equipment.\n7) The Facility has a training program designed to ensure that qualified personnel operate the system.\n8) The facility has emergency response procedures that enable trained personnel to respond quickly to \n     isolate any potential releases.\n\n\n\nD.

Five Year Accident History\n\nOne ammonia-related incident was identified for the Bakersfield Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site consequences. The amount released was eleven (11) pounds of ammonia. The on-site Injury had no offsite consequences. Upgraded oil removing equipment with new process controls were implemented as a result of this accident.\n\n\n\nF. Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nAn Emergency response program is in place at the Bakersfield Plant. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe Emergency response program includes the following elements:\n\n1) Fire Plan\n2) Ammonia Leak Procedures\n3) Evacuation Procedures\n4) Responsibilities of the Emergency Response team\n    **The above Program has been coordinated with the Bakersfield fire Department.\n\n\nG.
