      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant has instituted a Risk Management Program for their wastewater treatment facility, Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant, as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68.  The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at this facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities; describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees and offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) is being filed as required by ARP regulations in order to report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant treats wastewater collected from the City and County of Sacramento, and from the City of Folsom.  It is located at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between Interstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Meadowview Rd.  The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a buffer between the Plant and nearby residential areas.  There are 300 full-time employees at this site.  The Plant treats 165 million gallons of wastewater per day (mgd) on average.  \n\nThe Plant uses chlorine for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination and maintains quantities of these RS's greater than the Federal threshold quantities.  Additionally, methane gas, an "

Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is formed in the digesters as bacterial digestion proceeds.  The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, stored in low pressure and high pressure gas holders, and piped to a cogeneration plant where it is used to generate electricity and steam.  Whatever quantity of digester gas which cannot be used by the cogeneration plant is flared.  The entire inventory of digester gas in the plant must be considered for the purpose of comparisin with Federal threshold quantity.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nIt is the policy of Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the handling of methane, at its facility be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of these RS's to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant has gathered safety information on chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane, and on the process, equipment and procedures involving these RS's; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; "

The worst case release scenario is defined in the ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest single container of RS (in this case sulfur dioxide) over a period of 10 minutes. The scenario considered the release of the contents of the largest container of sulfur dioxide on site, in this case a railcar containing 180,000 lb. (90 tons).  This release scenario is not physically possible, due to the characteristics of sulfur dioxide.\n\nAdditionally, a \"worst case\" release scenario is required for be considered for flammable materials.  The worst case scenario considered is the explosion of the largest single container on site containing digester gas, a full LSG holder tank, containing 80,000 cu.ft. (3,200 lbs.) of methane.\n\nALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nAn \"alternative case\" release scenario is required to be considered for each toxic RS handled in quantities greater than the threshold quantity at the site, and an additional \"alternative case\" release scenario is to be considered for all flammable RS's handled in quantities greater than the threshold quantity at the site.\n\nThe \"alternative case\" scenario is described in the ARP regulations as a likely release resulting in offsite effects, considering administrative controls and mitigation measures in place, and is to be determined by the facility operators as part of the Process Hazard Analysis required to be performed during RMP development.  The \"alternative cases\" for toxic substances considered for this facility are the release of sulfur dioxide from a broken pressure gauge connection on a liquid lin"

The \"alternative case\" for flammable substances considered for this facility is the release of digester gas from an LSG holder tank's 18\" relief valve, venting at 1800 scfm, or 72 pounds per minute, for 10 minutes.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\n\nAdministrative controls in effect at Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant which were considered to mitigate the severity of the Worst Case and Alternative Case release scenarios include Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant's written policies and procedures for training of operators and maintenance personnel, written procedures for control of the inventory of chlorine at the facility, and policies regarding quality level of replacement materials and components for the chlorine system.\n\nMITIGATION MEASURES\n\nNo mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Worst Case scenarios.  Passive mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenarios for toxic RS's in the form of the use of custom-fabricated liquid chemical pressure gauge connection nipples (1/8\" I.D. for sulfur dioxide and 1/16\" I.D. for chlorine).  No mitigation measures were considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario for flammable RS's.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Cases for toxics, in the form of response of trained employees to a leak alarm in accordance with written procedures to shut remotely-operated line isolation valves in a timely manner.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention programs instituted by Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant are categorized as administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and engineering co"
