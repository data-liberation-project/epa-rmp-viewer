As such, the Coop has developed policies and procedures for the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia as well as response to potential releases. These include: \n1.    A commitment to meet regulatory requirements related to the safe handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.\n2.    Training programs for all employees involved with handling anhydrous ammonia.\n3.    Routine preventive maintenance of fixed and portable anhydrous ammonia equipment to assure compliance with regulations as well as to identify and correct potential defects.\n4.    The training of key operations personnel in notification of emergency responders and procedures to follow in event of an accidental release.\n5.    Coordination of emergency response plans and public protective actions with local emergency responders and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe accidental release prevention program for anhydrous ammonia storage facilities at the Coop involves four primary objectives. All anhydrous ammonia plant operators receive training on the hazards and safety procedures related to handling anhydrous ammonia. This training includes:\n1.    Physical hazards, emergency procedures and first aid.\n2.    Normal and emergency plant start up, operating and shut down procedures.\n3.    Plant inspection and maintenance procedures.\n4.    Plant design, including physical protection from identified hazards such as vehicular collision and installation of emergency shutoff valves.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\nThis fixed facility has not e"

      "SummaryText": "xperienced a reportable accidental release in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nEmergency response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia is accomplished by one of three methods, depending on the severity and anticipated duration of the release.\n1.    For minor releases, most commonly caused by a valve leak or failure during operation, trained operators wearing proper personal protective equipment and working from an upwind position will attempt to close the faulty valve.\n2.    For more serious releases, trained plant operators will isolate the area and notify the proper emergency response personnel. The Coop will communicate with area responders to determine which agencies have proper equipment and training to handle anhydrous ammonia releases.\n3.    For large releases not easily contained, Coop employees will notify emergency response dispatch with a description of the problem and recommend appropriate emergency response actions for the community based on their knowledge of the product.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\nThe Coop believes it has established an effective, proactive safety program with regard to the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia so consequently, there are no planned changes to our procedures and programs at this time. The Coop does plan to carefully monitor the effectiveness of all policies and procedures and if improvements are indicated, take prompt action to correct any deficiencies with regards to public and employee safety.  \n"
