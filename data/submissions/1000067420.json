      "SummaryText": "VP Racing Fuels RMP Executive Summary\r\nThe VP Racing Fuels facility produces racing fuels by purchasing commercial unleaded gasoline and commercial aviation fuel and blending in additives that boost the octane and hence performance of the racing fuels.  The regulated substances at this facility are isopentane and isoprene, both of which are subject to the RMP because they are flammable liquids; VP Racing Fuels does not store or use any toxic chemicals subject to these regulations.  VP Racing Fuels stores isoprene in a 15,000-gallon aboveground storage tank (AST) at 19.45 pounds per square inch (psi) and isopentane in a 20,000-gallon AST at 20.70 psi.  The racing fuels are blended in atmospheric tanks and either shipped out in bulk via tanker trucks or placed in drums, which are shipped out via truck. VP Racing Fuels is committed to worker safety, public health, and environmental protection. The results of the RMP process described herein serve to meet VP Racing Fuels' regulatory obligations, help VP Racing Fuels responsibly manage their chemicals, and make important chemical safety information available to responders and the public in the community where VP Racing Fuels operates.\r\n\r\nThe facility has determined that the most likely release scenario of the regulated substances would be due to catastrophic failure of one of the two pressurized tanks holding the regulated substances.  To reduce the potential impact of any release, the facility has instituted managerial and physical controls (limiting the amount of regulated chemicals onsite at any one time and separated dikes to contain any potential releases, respectively). Two worst-case release scenarios were run using RMP Comp software, one each for the complete rapid loss of both the isoprene storage tank and the isopentane storage tank. For RMP, a \"worst case scenario\" is defined as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure (including administrative controls"

The isopentane release scenario resulted in a distance to the endpoint of 0.4 miles and the isoprene release scenario resulted in a distance to the endpoint of 0.3 miles.\r\n\r\nFacility personnel would not be first responders to an accidental release, which will require the assistance of outside responders.  Annual coordination meetings are held between facility personnel and the local volunteer fire department.  In addition, the Bexar County Fire Marshall's office and the company's insurance carrier conduct annual inspections of the site.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe facility has not had any accidental releases of any chemicals that required reporting or additional response actions other than minor cleanup activities in the past five years.  No persons or environmental resources have been affected by any of the aforementioned small releases that required minor cleanup.\r\n   \r\nVP Racing Fuels strives for continuous improvement by closely monitoring onsite chemical inventory, maintaining existing engineering controls, reviewing and updating standard operating procedures as needed, and providing training to relevant facility personnel to be able to prevent a release from occurring and mitigate any releases that might occur."
