The Facility Policy:  The owners, management, and employees of Mears Fertilizer, Inc., (MFI) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees receive regular training in, and have access to, our written Process Safety and Risk Management Plan (PSM/RMP) which includes, but is not limited to, process safety information, emergency action and operating and maintenance procedures.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Butler County HazMat Team, and/or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  Facility Information:  The primary activity at MFI is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to Cooperatives and Retail Agriculture Dealers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and used for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  The maximum quantity stored and handled would be 139,914 pounds in a 30,000 gallon storage tank.  \r\n\r\n3.   The worst case and the alternate release scenarios have been evaluated and shared with our local first responders as part of an on-going training program.  More importantly, our employees have been trained in their respective emergency actions, including the emergency meeting place and each of their individual responsibilities regarding an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n4.  The accidental release prevention program:  MFI has implemented the provisions of \r\n- ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014, \"Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"\r\n- 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia,\"\r\n- Kansas Administrative Regulations, Kansas Department of Agriculture, 4-10,\r\n- 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process safety management of highly hazardous chemicals\"\r\nOur training program includes comprehensive written exams for operators of our covered process.  We use emergency shutoff valves at our fixed storage vessel for added protect"

The Five-year Accident History:  We have had no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n6.  The emergency response program:  MFI has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38, and has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  Operators of our covered process receive periodic training in emergency shutdown procedures.  The local responders are regularly invited to tour our facility to remain familia"
