This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \n\u00b7\tIntroduction;\n\u00b7\tConAgra\u00bfs policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\u00b7\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\n\u00b7\tHazard Assessment;\n\u00b7\tPrevention Program;\n\u00b7\tFive-Year Accident History;\n\u00b7\tEmergency Response Plan; \n\u00b7\tEmergency Communications;\n\u00b7\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\n\u00b7\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\n\u00b7\tManagement Program\n\nII.\tConAgra\u00bfs Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at ConAgra; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. ConAgra is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is ConAgra\u00bfs policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental).
