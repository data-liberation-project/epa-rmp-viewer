      "SummaryText": "The North Plant at Peterson is primarily cold storage and cut up or further processing. No cooking is done. The refrigeration system cantains 9812 #s of ammonia maximum and has5 large compressors, 3 recirculators, air evaporators, andrelated controls and air exchange units in the freezers. The PSM committee has prepared a PSM program with written operating procedures, lockout details, pumpdown and purge procedures, emergency shut-down procedures and a trouble shooting guide. Operators are all quailified and tested on the operating procedures before being allowed to work alone. A spill trailer with emergency is on site and contains level A suits, SCBA's and a cascade air refilling system for the respirators. All operators have completed OSHA's 40 hour HAZWOPER training.  The worst case release would be from a liquid line or vessel rupture. Distance to the toxic endpoint is .6mi and winds blow mostly towards the northeast. The most likely release would be from a relief valve and the ammonia is not expected to get off-site. Medical facilities will be established in the Peterson Gym in the event of a worst case release\n\n"
