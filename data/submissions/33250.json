      "SummaryText": "Stoney Creek Technologies (SCT) is an internationally known manufacturer of Sulfonates with a manufacturing facility located in Trainer, PA. There are currently 30 employees at this facility.\n\nSCT manufactures and markets world-wide, a series of corrosion inhibitors under the trade name SACI (Severe Atmospheric Corrosion Inhibitor). Additionally, SCT is currently toll-producing oil and fuel, and metalworking additives for multiple customers.\n\nStoney Creek Technologies operates all processes in an environmentally responsible manner. SCT believes that safety is unequivocally our number one priority. We have an excellent employee driven safety program and an outstanding safety record.\n\nIn the manufacturing of SACI and the oil, fuel and metal working additives, SCT uses one regulated substance, Oleum (fuming sulfuric acid). This raw material is used in the production of sulfonic acids, which are the building blocks for our products. The chemical is received at our facility by tankwagon and is unloaded into one of two registered horizontal carbon steel storage tanks with a capacity of 18,000 gallons each. A dike designed to contain the oleum surrounds the storage tanks. SCT's written operational procedure administratively holds the maximum level at 10,000 gallons. High level alarms are set at 10,858 gallons with high-high level alarms set at 12,530. A separate, high, high level shut-off system prevents further offloading and shuts the offloading process completely down at 14, 738 gallons.\n\nThe controls now in place to limit the quanity released include the following:\nAdministrative Controls to set the maximum levels in each tank.\nSeparate high level alarms with interlock shut-off switches.\nA concrete retention wall (dike).\nTankwagon unloading retention basin with automatic shut-off / depressurization switch.\nRemote emergency shut-off switch.\nFixed white oil system (for vapor supression).\nFixed water monitors (for vapor suppression).\nHM200 HAZMAT foam nozzles (for vapor s"

Practices, which are part of our operational SOP and accidental release program include numerous technological systems including back up systems and redundacies, procedural and managerial practices, PM and employee training in prevention of accidental releases and how to respond should one occur. SCT has an Intergrated Contingency Plan in place which includes our Spill Prevention Containment and Countermeasures, Preparedness, Prevention and Contingency, Spill Prevention Resonse Plans, and the DOT Security Plan.\n\nThe SCT emergency response program includes:\nDirect communication with the local fire board and LEPC via portable and mobile two-way radios.\nA plant-wide alarm system.\nAll telephones in this facility are able to directly call 911 outside emergency services.\nMobile fire equipment.\nTrained and equipped HAZMAT responders.\nMutual aid  with area refineries.\nLocal volunteer fire fighters that have been trained in vapor suppression and in the operation of our Foam Pumper Fire Truck. \n\nIn the last 5 years there have been no accidental releases of the regulated substance under Stoney Creek Technologies.\nSCT has recently completed a Process Safety Hazard Review for our process ultilizing oleum; the recommendations for this audit are being evaluated."
