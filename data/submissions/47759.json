This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safety and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant, located near Cheyenne Wells, Co. operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, condensate) from oil and gas wells.  The Ladder Creek Helium Plant handles methane, ethane, propane, and butane which are regulated flammables.  It processes approximately 35 million cubic feet a day of raw natural gas and natural gas liquids.  The Ladder Creek Helium Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\n General Accidental Release Prevention Program \\ Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant. Because processes at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulati"

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Ladder Creek Helium Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition; The Ladder Creek Helium Plant has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include a safety committee to promote both process and personal safety.  The committee typically has members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and local plant management\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific employees within the Ladder creek Helium Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. This information is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and "

This information specifically addresses known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The Ladder Creek Helium Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant primarily uses the What If / Hazop methodology to perform these evaluations.  This analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finds is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Ladder Greek Helium Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Ladder Creek Heli"

New employees receive initial training in Ladder Creek Helium Plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skill demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Consequently contractors working on or near process equipment at the Ladder Creek Helium Plant are trained on procedures to ensure that contractors \n(1) perform their work in a safe manner, \n(2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, \n(3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, \n(4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, \n(5) understand and follow site safety rules, and \n(6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \n\nThis is accomplished by providing contractors with \n(1) a process overview, \n(2) information about safety and health hazards, \n(3) emergency response plan requirements, and \n(4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. \n\nIn addition, the Ladder Creek Helium Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally read.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements were properly implemented.\n\n Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: \n(1) conducting training, \n(2) developing written procedures, \n(3) performing inspections and tests, \n(4) correcting identified deficiencies, and \n(5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on \n(1) an overview of the process, \n(2) safety and health hazards, \n(3) applicable maintenance procedures, \n(4) emergency response plans, and \n(5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. \n\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness).

      "SummaryText": ", employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a group of experts will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Ladder Creek Helium Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.  Pre-startup safety reviews are also used to support the quality assurance program.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include \n(1)  control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, \n(2)  a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment that is being worked on, \n(3)  a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, \n(4)  a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), \n(5)  a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space.  These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes that affect any covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verIfy that existing controls have not been compr"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Ladder Creek Helium Plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Ladder Creek Helium Plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAS and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo ensure that the Risk Management Program is functioning properly, DCP Midstream periodically conducts audits to verify that the policies, procedures and practices required by the Risk Management Program are being implemented properly and fully, to evaluate the effectiveness of the program, and to develop ideas for improving the program.  These audits are independent, site-specific, and methodical.  Compliance audits are conducted every 3 years.  The findings of the audit are forwarded by the audit team to plant management for priority resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The fin"
