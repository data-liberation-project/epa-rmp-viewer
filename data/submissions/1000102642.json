Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFollowing a PSM internal audit proposed actions to improve safety include; an additional sensor in chlorine tank room for redundancy, connecting chlorine tank room sensors to Mill operator control screens, improving alarm system to occupied structures connected to chlorine equipment and permanently reducing the amount of chlorine on-site to below 1,500 lbs."

This facility observes safety precautions in handling chlorine to reduce the threat to workers, members of the community, and the environment, and adheres to applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the way the facility handles chlorine, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that are used, and the training of personnel.\n\nEmergency response for this facility is coordinated with the Garfield County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Enid Fire Department.  This includes procedures for notifying the LEPC in the event of an accident involving chlorine.\n\nb. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThis facility is a flour mill.  The regulated substance at this facility is chlorine.  Chlorine is stored in a single one (1) ton cylinder. We order the single one (1) ton cylinder to be filled less than 3/4 full, i.e. 1,400 lbs. We have two (2) additional one (1) ton cylinders which are empty and were previously used when chlorine demand was higher.\n\nc. Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nWorst-Case Scenario: As a worst-case scenario, it is assumed that the entire contents of a single one (1) ton chlorine cylinder is released as vapor over a ten minute period.\n\nAlternative Scenario: An alternative release scenario involving chlorine would be a slow vapor release from a piping failure at a flange, joint, weld or seal.\n\nd. Accidental Release Prevention\n\nThe key concepts in this facility's prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training for employees.\n\ne. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThis facility has not had any accidents involving chlorine that require reporting under EPA's Risk Management Rule.\n\nf. Emergency Response Program\n\nEmergency re"
