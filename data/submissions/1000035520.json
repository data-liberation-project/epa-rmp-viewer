It is our intent not only to comply with the mandatory parts of these safety regulations, but also with the spirit of them.  We have designed this PSM/RMP program to control and reduce the risk of injury, death, environmental damage, or property damage as well as being a teaching aid for employees to learn how their job is an integral part of the PSM/RMP process.  The program protects employees, contractors and the public.  We are committed to its purpose.  We ask all employees and contractors to perform to the spirit and requirements of this program by learning how your job is an integral part of the PSM/RMP program, by performing your work to the PSM/RMP Program requirements, and by making suggestions to improve the Program.\n\n\n\nThe Cope Station Power Plant is located at 405 Teamwork Road Cope, South Carolina in the County of Orangeburg.  The power plant generates 430 megawatts of electricity from pulverized coal.\n\n\n\nThe Cope Station Power Plant operates a SCR de-Nox system to lower its Nox emissions.  The SCR process utilizes anhydrous ammonia to react with the NOx compounds producing nitrogen and water.  This process necessitates the storage of large quantities of ammonia.  The RMP program is initiated when a facility stores 10,000 lb. or more of anhydrous ammonia, which the Cope Station Power Plant does store over this amount.  The Cope Station Power Plant is rated a Program 3 facility.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in two tanks. The two storage tanks are located inside a concrete secondary containment dike to limit the spread of liquid ammonia in case of a tank rupture.  The liquid ammonia is delivered to the facility by tanker truck.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was identified to be a rupture of one of the storage tanks.  The result of this scenario was modeled using RMPCOMP. In the analysis administrative controls "

Additionally the tanks are located inside a concrete secondary containment dike, which limits the release rate to 12,100 lb/minute.

The facility has an emergency response team on site.  As part of complying with the above regulations an Emergency Response Plan will be developed in compliance with the regulations.
