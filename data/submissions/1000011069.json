The scope of the program starts with the ownership of the Plant Manager for the safety of our employees, the community well being, and the  idea for environmental preservation. We selected a qualified employee adminstrator with years of experience in developing an effecient RMP program. Employee participation, training, and ownership is critical. A PHA committee was developed to brain storm all forseeable problems, process break downs, and corrective actions for the prevention of incidents and releases. The QSE department has been assigned to mediate and review all processes. We have contracted with four quality professional companies to help develop, train, and implement all required steps to keep us in compliance while maintaining safety for our employees, community and the environment. And lastly we have set a system in place to notify all applicable organizations for a speedy and effiecent communication and reponse should a release occurs.              \n"
