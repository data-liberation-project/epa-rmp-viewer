Written procedures are maintained and are followed by Bayer CropScience Muskegon personnel and contactors that perform work in our processes. The Bayer CropScience Muskegon Emergency Response & Contingency Plan is readily available and includes the immediate and follow-up reporting to federal, state, and local authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the Michigan Department of Natural Resources & Enviroment MDNRE)), the state and local emergency planning centers (LEPC' s), local fire and police departments, and other interested parties. \n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe Bayer CropScience Muskegon Site is located 2 miles north of Muskegon, MI.  The site has a total area of 400 acres, which 40 acres are developed.\n\nBayer CropScience- Muskegon has one production process at this site that is covered by the RMP rule.  It is the Glufosinate Ammonium (GA process.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a raw material for the GA production.  The Glufosinate Ammonium process produces a herbicide.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nManaging Process Safety at the Bayer CropScience Muskegon Site requires proactive identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of chemical releases that could occur as a result of failures in processes, procedures, or equipment.  We endorse and maintain an effective process safety management program that requires a systematic approach to evaluating the whole process. Using this approach, the process design, process technology, operational and maintenance activities and procedures, non-routine activities and procedures, emergency preparedness plans and procedures, tra"

The various lines of defense that have been incorporated into the design and operation of the unit process to prevent or mitigate the release of hazardous chemicals are evaluated and strengthened as needed to assure their effectiveness at each level. Ultimately, the major objective of process safety management of hazardous chemicals is to prevent unwanted releases of hazardous chemicals which could expose our employees and others to serious hazards.  Elements in the accident prevention program include programs such as: Management of Change, Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Mechanical Integrity, Incident Investigation, Compliance Audits and Permits To Work for Bayer employees and contractors.\n\nIn regard to specific chemicals and processes regulated under RMP, the processes subject to the RMP regulation are also subject to OSHA process safety management (PSM) regulation.  OSHA's PSM regulation is intended to prevent potential releases inside the plant and the RMP program is meant to help control or prevent releases which may affect off-site human health or the environment.\n\nAccidental releases from these processes are prevented by studying the hazards of the processes to identify potential hazards and implementing procedures, installing control devices and systems, and providing training to control those hazards.  The processes are periodically evaluated to assess the risk of the operations by current standards and to make improvements where necessary. \n\nIn addition to skilled operators, the processes are controlled by computerized control systems which monitor and record conditions within the processes and make adjustments accordingly.  In addition to the control systems, several of the processes are equipped with redundant computer safety systems which act to correct or shutdown the processes if certain parameters are exceeded and other process are equipped with direct shu"

All of the processes covered by RMP utilize scrubbers to reduce emissions from the process to minimize releases to the atmosphere.\n\nMaintenance of equipment containing hazardous substances is also a key element in preventing accidental releases. In addition, any changes made to the processes are carefully reviewed prior to implementation to ensure that safety and environmental risks are recognized and addressed.  These changes are managed under the site's Management of Change procedure(MOC).  Finally, while many steps have been taken to prevent accidental releases, in the event of a release, it is investigated to determine the root causes and a corrective action plan is developed and implemented to prevent re-occurrence.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Glufonsinate Ammonium process has zero accidental releases from RMP-covered processes that meet the RMP reporting criteria during the last five years.  \n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Bayer CropScience Muskegon site relies on local first responders (i.e.: local fire department and HazMat Team) for assistance.  The Muskegon Site interacts with the local emergency responders on a periodic basis to ensure that capabilities and hazards are communicated and understood. The site has a site-wide notification system in place in the event of an emergency.\n\nCHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThere are many operating and mechanical changes that continuously occur to improve site.  The Bayer Action Tracking System (BATS) is the electronic tool the Bayer CropScience Muskegon Site uses to document incidents and follow-up actions and it also includes the Management of Change process to manage changes."
