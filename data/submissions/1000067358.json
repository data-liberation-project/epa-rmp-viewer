The Vaporcatcher is designed to process tank vapors and recover liquid products from vapors by physical separation and cryogenic means.  The Vaporcatcher is considered a small natural gas processing plant for regulatory purposes. NGLs recovered from this process are marketed for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nPioneer has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the company's efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process. Pioneer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery are located approximately 1.6 miles southwest of Windsor, Colorado. From the intersection of County Road 13 and County Road 64, drive one mile east on County Road 64 and then drive one-half mile north to reach the site. At this location, the Vaporcatcher process is used produce the following products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as NGLs)\n\n2. Light Gas\n\n\n\nThe NGL product contains ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenario"

      "SummaryText": "s to consider.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThere is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery.  The scenario consists of a vapor cloud explosion involving 79,710 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in a full 18,000-gallon NGL Tank. The WCS results in the largest impacted area with a 0.3-mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe site is located near a residential area and future golf course. The WCS has an offsite endpoint and would affect several adjacent homes as offsite nearby public receptors.  Pioneer has controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences. Mitigation measures include relief valves, check valves, grounding equipment, and rupture disks.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 11,643 pounds of NGLs from a pipe between a Vaporcatcher skid and the NGL tank. The release would occur from a break in the 1-inch pipeline that would involve 202 pounds per minute being released for 60 minutes before the leak was stopped. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.2 miles, which includes an offsite endpoint and nearby public receptors. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery are not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since it can be operated remotely and Pioneer does not keep employees at its location. This results in the process being Program Level 2. The following sections detail how Pioneer complies with the Program 2 requirements for accident prevention. \n\n\n\nA. Process Safety Information/Process Controls\n\n\n\nPioneer keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These technical documents address the following:\n\n\n\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n\n2. Necessary Block Flo"

Identification of necessary regulatory equipment design documents\n\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  For specific areas within the process, Pioneer has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual.  The company maintains the overall process within these limits by using remote controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \n\n\n\nB. Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery identify and control hazards associated with the RMP covered scenario.  This program systematically examines and explores for potential hazards, then establishes controls to put in place to manage the potential hazards.  The hazard review is conducted using checklists by Pioneer's employees and/or consultants who have operation, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience.  This review evaluates and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards identified.  The findings are forwarded to Pioneer for review.  The approved mitigation options in response to the hazard review findings are tracked"

The results and findings from these updates will be documented and retained.\n\n\n\nC. Operating Procedures\n\n\n\nPioneer maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practice and manufacturers.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures will be periodically reviewed and annually certified as current accurate by management.

Training\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery have implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the covered process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test or hands on observation specific to the plant operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. "

      "SummaryText": "IVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery are a new facility.  There have been no accidental releases from a covered process that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery site is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The company maintains written emergency procedures, which are in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  These procedures identify steps to be taken in case of an accidental release. However, the facility is an unmanned location and company personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate.  The Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nRMP MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\nPioneer has assigned responsibility for the risk management program to the Vice President of Business Development and maintains a management system to oversee program elements.\n\n \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety. Rather, the company believes that diligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework that allows for the continued improvement to the level of safety at the Vaporcatchers at the Raindance Tank Battery. Some of the key components"
