The Safety and Health Coordinator administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Safety and Health Coordinator periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan. \n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Sweetwater Authority facility uses a chlorine system to treat water.  Chlorine is used as a disinfectant to purify the water.  The chlorine is delivered to the facility in one ton containers, which are then connected to the water treatment system, as needed.  The liquid chlorine leaves the one ton containers and enters the evaporators, which turn the liquid chlorine into a gas.  The chlorine gas then proceeds to the chlorinators, where it is pulled into the injectors, which then send the chlorine into the water distribution system.\n\nIn the chlorine tank room at Sweetwater Authority there are two chlorine tanks connected to the chlorine system (only one is used at a time).  The controller in the chlorine tank room monitors the weight of each one ton chlorine container.  When the tank in operation is close to empty, the controller shuts off the valve connected to that tank and opens the valve connected to the full tank.  The empty tank is then replaced with a full tank from the storage area.  This replacement is done by the Sweetwater Authority operators using the monorail hoist.\n\nThe maximum total chlorine inventory"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Sweetwater Authority to prevent the accidental release of chlorine from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the chlorine system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the chlorine system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before chlorine is first introduced into a new or modified process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Sweetwater Authority's employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of chlorine and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\n\nIn addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  This includes common practices outlined by the Chlorine Institute.  Chlorine gas detectors are located in the chlorine tank storage room, the chlorinator room, the evaporator room, and the chemical room.  There a"

The operators and maintenance technicians are trained in the use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and chlorine repair kits (Type B Kit).  Annual refresher courses are held for the Sweetwater Authority operators, maintenance staff, and laboratory staff which deal with the procedures for handling hazardous materials.  The local police, fire, and hazardous materials agencies have been integrated into the facility response plan.  \n\nIn the event of an emergency on the chlorine system, authorized staff will attempt to isolate the cause of the emergency by activating the Emergency Shutoff System first and notify management and the local authorities, as necessary.  The in-houes HazMat Team will wear the proper safety equipment (a positive, pressure-demand, full facepiece, self contained, breathing apparataus or pressure demand supply air respirator with escape and a fully encapsulated, chemical resistant suit is required for response) prior to entering the emergency location.\n\nIn order to perform an emergency shutdown an operator or authorized employee will active the Emergency Shutoff System by breaking the glass on the the Emergency Shutoff System switch located outside of the Chlorine Storage Building.  The procedure is detailed in the Emergency Planning & Response section of Volume I of the PSM/RMP manual.  A chlorine specific alarm tone will sound over the Public Address system.  The alarm could mean there is a chlorine leak, but not necessarily.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn September 1994, the chlorine system was thoroughly examined f"
