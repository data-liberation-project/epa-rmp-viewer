The Lake Bridge Water Treatment Plant was installed to chlorinate water obtained primarily from Cypress Bridge Wellfield, but also receives flow from Cypress Creek, Crossbar, and Morris Bridge Wellfields.  Flow leaving Lake Bridge is destined for Central Pasco County.  The facility is located on County Line Road in Hillsborough County.  The station includes an enclosed chlorination room, which contains cylinders of compressed chlorine gas, a pre- and post-chlorinator, and various types of safety equipment.  An adjacent room contains caustic soda and a chlorine scrubber.  A maximum of four one-ton cylinders of chlorine (8,000 lb) is housed at Lake Bridge.  One cylinder (2,000 lb) is connected to the chlorination system at any given time.  The facility is normally unmanned.  Water treatment operators from the Cypress Creek Pumping Station, at which personnel are always present, visit the facility as necessary to remove empty chlorine cylinders from and connect new cylinders to the chlorination system.  Cypress Creek staff members perform maintenance and safety inspections of Lake Bridge every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.   Lake Bridge qualifies as a Program 2 facility under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") guidelines.\n\nb. The Tampa Bay Water accidental release prevention program at Lake Bridge Water Treatment Plant involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices, and adheres to all applicable procedures of EPA.  The Tampa Bay Water emergency response program (\"ERP\") is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nc. The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine-related release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release\" and \"alternative release.\"  The first scenario defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that themaximum quantity in the largest vesselis released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified"

      "SummaryText": " failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\"\n\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling must be performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 3 parts per million (\"ppm\"), which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (\"ERPG-2\").  This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (\"AIHA\") as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\"  The residential population within a circle corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance must be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\ni. The worst-case release scenario at the Lake Bridge Water Treatment Plant involves  failure of a single one-ton (2,000 lb) chlorine cylinder.  The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed using EPA-defined conditions: release of the entire amount as a gas in 10 minutes, use of the one-hour average ERPG-2 (3 ppm) as the toxic endpoint, and consideration of the population residing within a full circle with radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance. \n\nEPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/s, highest daily maximum temperature (96oF), and average relative humidity (74%) were inputs for analysis of the worst-case release scenario.\n\nEnclosure of chlorine cylinders within a building was considered a form of passive mitigation.  An EPA-recommended release rate-multiplicative factor of 55% was applied to the worst-case release modeling input data.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 3"

      "SummaryText": ".6 miles and an estimated residential population affected of 5,606 was obtained.  \n\nii.  The alternative release scenario involves the detachment of a transfer line from a \n    one-ton cylinder, and partial release of the cylinder's contents.  Using the EPA-\n    recommended chlorine discharge equation, 540 lb of chlorine is released over 60 \nminutes. As part of this scenario, a 2,300-lb capacity chlorine scrubber online at Lake Bridge prevents the release of any chlorine offsite.  \n\nPlease note that RMP*Submit version 1.1.5 software, required by EPA for RMP submission, does not allow the user to input a value of \"zero\" for the toxic endpoint distance.  At the recommendation of RMP*Submit Technical Support personnel, a value of \"0.01 miles\" was entered in this field to satisfy the program's requirements.  However, the true distance to the toxic endpoint is zero, and the affected population is zero for the alternative release scenario. \n\nd. The Tampa Bay Water accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n7 High level training of the operators\n7 Preventive maintenance program\n7 Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n7 Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n7 Performance of a process hazard analysis of equipment and procedures\n\nChlorine-specific prevention steps include:\n\n7 Training in the practices of safe chlorine handling\n7 The availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators during connection / disconnection of chlorine supply\n7 Awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine\n7 Presence of chlorine detectors\n\ne. No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the past five years.\n\nf. Lake Bridge has an emergency response program, which includes emergency response training of Tampa Bay Water personnel, establishment of specific procedures to be followed in the event of an accidental release, and coordinati"
