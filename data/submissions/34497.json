This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.0    RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Con Agra Foods (ConAgra) facility in Trenton, Missouri has a good record in preventing releases of anhydrous* ammonia.  The ConAgra facility has a thorough emergency training program for on-site emergency responders.  The facility has implemented ConAgra?s HAZWOPER plan (emergency response program) which is a plan designed for the safety of its employees?, the community and the environment.  This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency - the established action plan and appropriate personnel involved in containing a hazardous release (HAZMAT team) and contacting the Fire Department once the situation is under control.  As part of this emergency response program, ConAgra emphasizes a thorough training program and medical surveillance of the HAZMAT team prior to and after an incident.  With the potential dangers associated with a hazardous chemical release, ConAgra has researched and developed safe containment and disposal procedures as well as an evaluation procedure following an emergency response.  All of these components make the ConAgra HAZWOPER plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response.\n\nThe emergency response policies at the ConAgra facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week.  There are also provisions for coordination with outside agencies such as the Trenton Fire Department and Grundy County LEPC in the event of an emergency.\n\n*From this point in the Executive Summary, anhydrous ammonia will be synonymous with ammonia.\n\n2.0    PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nConAgra is a meat and cheese canning, thermal processing facility, with Vienna sausage"

      "SummaryText": " as the main product.  The NAICS code for this process at this facility is 311612.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to preserve the food products.\n\nConAgra has one regulated substance under 40 CFR 68: ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in the refrigeration of the foods in the various areas of the plant.\n\nThe ammonia threshold for triggering applicability to 40 CFR 68 is 10,000 pounds. The Trenton plant has one ammonia refrigeration process for the preservation of the food products.  The quantity of ammonia stored on-site is approximately 16,000 pounds.  The process exceeds the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds as set by 40 CFR 68 and thus is regulated.\n \n3.0    WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems have associated hazards that can potentially affect on-site employees and the general public off-site if there is a release from the system.  Described below are the associated hazards for the regulated chemical.  Though there are other scenarios possible, EPA only requires that one worst-case and one alternative scenario be reported for each process.  Since the Trenton facility only has one process, one worst-case and one alternative scenario were developed.\n\nAmmonia \n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1989.  The dominant characteristic of this chemical is its toxicity.  It is a self-alarming chemical by its distinctive pungent odor.  Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations.  Ammonia will burn at a very narrow and high range of concentrations accompanied with a high ignition temperature.  Although ammonia is not poisonous, it is corrosive to human tissue.  Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, at high concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe risks to persons in an accidental release of ammonia include:\n\n1.    Corrosive attack of skin and other tissue (including lung tissue)\n2.    Fr"

      "SummaryText": "eezing of skin and other body tissue when contacted by liquid ammonia\n\n4.0    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nConAgra has developed an OSHA PSM program for their ammonia refrigeration system.  At ConAgra, ammonia falls under the RMP Program 3 prevention program which is identical to the OSHA PSM program.  EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is in compliance with RMP Program 3.  Thus, ConAgra?s ammonia PSM has been reviewed and determined to be complete for the RMP document.\n\nThere are several aspects of the ammonia prevention program that are key:\n\n1.    The ammonia PSM program at ConAgra includes provisions for employee involvement, procedures for working with contractors, pre-startup safety reviews and managing change within the system.  The different sections of the PSM document detail employee participation (hazard analysis team), process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA ? what-if/checklist), operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, compliance audits and emergency planning and response (Emergency Action Plan).  The plant, therefore, maintains good training, certification, and employee awareness of operating procedures.\n\n2.    ConAgra has established a hazards analysis team (comprising of plant employees) responsible for updating existing operating procedures for the refrigeration system and also verifying and documenting the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n3.    In the event of a catastrophic release or an incident which could have results in a catastrophe, investigations will be undertaken (this is a policy of the PSM document).  Necessary preventative measures will be taken to reduce the risk of incident reoccurrence.\n\n5.0    FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe review of ConAgra?s accident history includes the following range of dates: June 22, 1999 - June 21, 2004. According to 40 CFR Part 68"

      "SummaryText": ".42(a), there have been no accidental releases at this facility.\n\n6.0    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAs mentioned previously, the ConAgra facility has developed an OSHA hazardous substance emergency response program called Emergency Action Plan.  The Emergency Action Plan document contains detailed procedures for: 1) pre-emergency planning and coordination; 2) personnel roles and lines of authority; 3) communication; 4) emergency recognition and prevention; 5) safe distances and places of refuge; 6) site security and control; 7) emergency alerting and response; and 8) emergency medical treatment and first aid.\n\nConAgra?s emergency response plan (Emergency Action Plan) is a detailed document which discusses the role of employees and management in an emergency situation.  All emergency response personnel undergo training and records of this training are maintained and updated on site.  The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting.  Depending upon a given situation, the Fire Department will be called to provide back-up emergency responders and equipment.   The Fire Department will be called for all fire related emergencies.  The incident commander has ultimate control of implementation of the emergency response plan.\n\nIn addition, Grundy County and the plant will stage annual mock disasters to make sure all personnel are properly trained and ready for any real emergencies.\n\n7.0    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBased on the completed Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for ammonia, a list of action items were developed and their status monitored to ensure that implementation was accomplished."
