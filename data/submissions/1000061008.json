The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs, which includes EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA's Process Safety Management Programs.  ACS has developed their RMP / PSM Manual to document policies addressing the implementation of the regulations governing these programs.  The Process Safety Management (PSM) sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study, procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others.  The RMP sections pertain to management systems, accident history and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis-OCA) Report.\n\n\n\nThe PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances, and forms the Program Level III Prevention Program component of the RMP.  The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen.  It is the primary goal of ACS to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations. With this in mind, the priorities of protection of life, the environment, and then property have been established.  Only when these goals are achieved may the focus shift to resumption of business operations.\n\n\n\nACS has adopted an overall \"Non-responding facility\" policy; has an established Emergency Action Plan and has taken the steps necessary to be included in the community emergency plan.  An Emergency Coordinator has been established and coordination with the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), Local Emergency Planning C"

Emergency response pre-planning is coordinated and kept current through the annual submittal of appropriate Reports, and periodic tours of the facility by the Fire Department.  ACS and affiliated Western Precooling Systems (WPS) support the Yuma Area Ammonia Safety Day, which has also been instrumental in coordination with local emergency responders. \n\n\n\nACS & WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.  ACS personnel are trained per its Emergency Action Plan.  Key WPS employees attend 1910.120 (q) Emergency Response training that is refreshed annually.  WPS emergency equipment is maintained under the control of WPS.  ACS emergency equipment is maintained under the control of ACS.  \n\n\n\nEach company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training (ACS employees and contracted production workers are trained for their emergency actions.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their emergency actions).\n\n\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe ACS facility is in an industrial area of Yuma just east of the Marine Corp Air Station, and provides pre-cooling and short-term storage for fresh vegetables.  The facility was put into operation in November of 2001 and is permitted.  Life and fire safety systems were engineered into the plant as part of its design and code requirements.  The facility employs a direct, mechanical refrigeration system, built in 2001 to the latest codes and standards in use at that time.  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Refrigeration System (System).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located outside (Compressors, Vessels, Condensers).  Cold Room evaporators are located inside; however, their associated valves and piping are lo"

ACS, LLC is owned by WPS-50% and QV Properties, LLC-50%.\n\n\n\nA portion of the ammonia equipment is portable and is moved on and off site seasonally as needed for the local produce season, which is common in the industry.  The interconnecting piping between the portable components is permanently mounted.  Additionally some vessels and the Cold Room evaporators are permanently mounted.  The busy season is from late November through mid-April annually.\n\n\n\nAccess to the facility is limited by a combination of fencing, gates, and retention basins on the perimeter.\n\n   \n\n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management (PSM) Program has been established in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM Program is specifically intended to prevent accidental releases & promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes.  PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation.  The written PSM document is maintained in the site's online RMP/PSM Management solution called WBBM (Web-based Business Manager).\n\n\n\nMonitoring and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment is a coordinated effort.  ACS personnel are responsible for day-to-day monitoring and operational maintenance.  WPS is the company that performs technical inspections & maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release.  The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to teardown and removal of portable equipment.  As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager.  The specific repair task or upgrade for th"

Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, ACS and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\n\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia Technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).  Technicians only perform tasks for which they have been pre-qualified.\n\n\n\n Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOver the years it became apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.  Special self-closing valves are now installed as a permissive for oil drain flow.  If a release were to develop during an oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  The facility has installed these types of valves at system oil drain points.\n\n\n\nOther release prevention steps taken at Advanced Cooling Systems, LLC:\n\n- Automatic Cutouts and Isolation Valves: Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards. Refrigerating equipment includes automated cut-outs and isolation valves. The cut-outs are designed to shut down equipment prior to out-of-tolerance conditions being met. Isolation valves would help limit the impact of a release scenario.\n\n- Monitoring & Alarm System: The refrigeration system is equipped with ammonia sensors and a monitored alarm system.\n\n- Ammonia Diffusion System: Pressure Relief Valves (PRV) are piped to an ammonia-water diffusion system.  If a PRV were to operate due to an over-pressure situation, the ammonia would be captured in the water tank.\n\n- Refrigerating equipment is protected via barriers and equipment placement (siting) practices\n\n- Ammonia storage is protected with an automated evaporative cooling system (reduc"

Entrance to the facility is closely monitored and limited.   \n\n- Fencing & gates around the facility help prevent unauthorized entry.\n\n- Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal's etc.  Training is documented in employee training record files.\n\n- Staff is trained in the benefits of good housekeeping.  The general appearance of the facility is maintained on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no qualifying accidental releases at the site over the last five years.   There is no data to report.\n\n\n\n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies.  ACS employees & contracted production workers are trained to notify and evacuate via the Plant's Emergency Action Plan.  The MCAS & City of Yuma Fire Departments would respond to an emergency; support would be made available via WPS personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards.  Appropriate written plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.
