      "SummaryText": "y.\n\n(e) EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nCYTEC OLEAN has developed a \"Consolidated Spill Prevention and Emergency Response (CSPER)\" Plan as outlined in section 4. This plan is coordinated with local emergency response through the Cattaraugus County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  Copies of the plan are provided to local fire and police departments, as well as privately contracted emergency responders.  \n\nThe plan defines individual responsibilities and tasks during various emergencies.   CYTEC OLEAN provides training appropriate to the level of involvement to all employees.\n\nDuring emergencies involving spills, CYTEC OLEAN employees are asked to report the event, provide key information on the type and extent of the emergency, and follow the Emergency Coordinator's instructions to stabilize processes, control employee access to affected in plant areas, and control immediate access to the facility by visitors, contractors and off-shift employees.  The Emergency Coordinator, or backups, direct this first response, and make timely notifications to local responders and the Emergency Response Contractor.  When local emergency responders arrive, the Emergency Coordinator provides on-site assistance and support.  Spill Response, including all clean-up and remedial operations, is the responsibility of the Emergency Response Contractor.  The Plan defines notifications to Local, State and Federal Agencies, as well as the Public.\n\n(f) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nCYTEC Industries is constantly striving to upgrade its processes, control technology, employee training, inspection, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety."
