              "Description": "Our Prevention Program consists of several new policies and procedures which document responsibility for program development and implementation.  The program involves all division employees who are trained to work safely and recognize chlorine related hazards in an attempt to protect the public.  Procedures have been written and have been implemented to ensure preventative action is taken with regards to equipment operation and maintenance to reduce risk.  Employees are trained both in the field and in a classroom setting to heighten awareness and prepare them to act in the event of an accidental gas chlorine release.  Internal compliance audits will take place annually at our facility.   A policy has been written to document who is to be involved with incident investigations if a release occurs.  The investigation section includes appropriate forms that are to be completed, recommendations for reducing the risk of a reoccurrence, and finally a list of contacts that must be made to report a release of 10 lbs. or more.",

Maximum inventory is 4,000 lbs.  No chlorine is on site between the period of November 15 and April 15.  A chlorine gas detector is installed and designed to alarm the Fire/Rescue District upon activation.  The Fire/Rescue District has assumed all responsbility for emergency response.  Facility operators are trained in the care and safe handling of chlorine in addition to the hazards it poses to the public.  Equipment maintenance is performed in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.  There has been no accident history, pertaining to the storage and handling of chlorine, for at least the past five years.  Within the next two years, a sodium hypochlorite system is planned to be installed at this facility and if completed, chlorine gas will no longer be used at this site.\n\nCERTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR PROGRAM LEVEL 2 PROCESSES:\nTo the best of the undersigned's knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the information submitted is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nSIGNATURE (name):  Jeff Van Landuyt\nTITLE:  Wastewater Treatment Superintendent, City of Woodstock            DATE: June 18, 1999"
