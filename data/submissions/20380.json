Facility Accidental Release Policy\n  The owners, manegment and employees of Sun Valley Packing 7381 Avenue 432 Reedley, Ca 93654 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, or other authorities to migrate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information\n  a. The primary activity at Sun Valley Packing is the packing, refrigeration and shipping of fruit.\n  b. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by tanker truck as needed to replintace the storage tanks for the refregeration units.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at Sun Valley Packing is 21,000 pounds.\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n  The Worst-Case Release Scenario.  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest ammount would release 2,200 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is .31miles.\n  Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history(or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a broken pipe.  The distance to the endpoint is .01 miles.\n4.
