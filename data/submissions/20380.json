Facility Accidental Release Policy\n  The owners, manegment and employees of Sun Valley Packing 7381 Avenue 432 Reedley, Ca 93654 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous Ammonia.  If any accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, or other authorities to migrate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  Facility Information\n  a. The primary activity at Sun Valley Packing is the packing, refrigeration and shipping of fruit.\n  b. Anhydrous Ammonia is received by tanker truck as needed to replintace the storage tanks for the refregeration units.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia handled at Sun Valley Packing is 21,000 pounds.\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n  The Worst-Case Release Scenario.  Failure of the largest storage tank when filled to the greatest ammount would release 2,200 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint is .31miles.\n  Alternative Release Scenario.  The alternative release scenario based on the five year accident history(or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a broken pipe.  The distance to the endpoint is .01 miles.\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n  Anhydrous Ammonia: The facility has implemented the previsions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" as published by the American National Standards Institute Inc., California Code of Regulations, title 8, Subchapter1,\" Unfired pressure Vessel Safety Orders\", and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, \" Storage and Handlingof Anhydrouse Ammonia.\"\n5.  Five- year Accident history\n  a. There have been no accidental release or near misses"

The Emergency Response Program\n  The Facility's emergency response program was written in accordance with the following regulations:\n  -- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38\n  -- OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 and\n  -- Section 25503, Division 6.95 of the California Health and Safety Code.\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n  Safety improvemnts is an on going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are preformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions  There are no additional specific planned changes to the Anhydrous Ammonia Processes at the facility."
