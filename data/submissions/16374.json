      "SummaryText": "CHAPTER 1- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Water Pollution Control Risk Management Plan for Safe Chlorine Handling involves a unified\napproach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential\nchlorine hazards and minimize the risk of accidental chlorine releases.  All applicable procedures of\n40CFR 68.170 are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health,\nand response agency interaction.\n\nThe Joshua Street Water Pollution Control Plant utilizes chlorine to disinfect the effluent flow before\nsending it to the Flint River.  The treatment plant services the residents of the City of Albany,\nsurrounding areas, and a large industrial base comprised of a wide range of manufacturing.  The\nchlorination process includes (liquid) chlorine cylinders, chlorination equipment, an instrument room,\nelectrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment.\n\nFor each chlorination process, accidental release modeling was performed for the respective area to\ndetermine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in accidental chlorine\nrelease.  The first \"worst case \" scenario, defined by EPA, states that \"the owner or operator shall\nassume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel... is released as a gas over release\nscenario\".  For the Joshua Street Plant an incident history review was performed to identify the most\nlikely case scenario.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by\nthe chlorine released before its concentration decreases to a theoretical \"toxic endpoint.\"  This is\ndefined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association as \"the maximum airborne concentration\nbelow which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without\nexperiencing or developing life-threatening health effects.\"  The residential population within a\nperimeter corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined"

      "SummaryText": "to estimate the population\npotentially affected.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the Joshua Street Plant involves the failure of a one-ton cylinder\nyielding a cumulative release of 2,000 lbs. of chlorine.  When atmospheric dispersion modeling for\nthis implausible scenario was performed, using the EPA guidance document, a distance to toxic\nendpoint  of 3.1 miles was obtained.\n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario for the chlorination process involves the mechanical\nfailure of one flexible manifold connection (pigtail) allowing the accidental release of a one ton\ncylinder of chlorine over a one hour period.  Similar atmospheric modeling per EPA guidance yields\na more likely figure of .38 miles affected radius under normal atmospheric conditions at each site. \nWithin these perimeters, the Joshua Street Plant identified ____receptors.  In support of the\nprobability that a worst case accidental release will not occur, a review of process history indicates\nthat no reportable accidental releases greater than a 10 lb quantity have occurred within the past five\nyears at the facility.\n\nThe Water Pollution Control Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to\nmitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n     *    Operator Training\n     *    Preventive Maintenance Program\n     *    Process specific safety equipment\n     *    Safe and effective standard operating procedures, written with operator participation\n     *    Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n     *    Auditing and inspection programs\n     *    Comprehensive Management Program\n\nFurther, WPC has an active environmental, health and safety program with the following elements\nspecifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process:\n     *    Respiratory protection (SCBA) program\n     *    Chlorine detectors\n     *    Chemical right to know program\n     *    Personal protective equipment program\n\nThe Joshua Street Treatment Plant has an emerg"
