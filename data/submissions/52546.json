Some of these products involve the use of propylene oxide to produce hydroxy propyl guar.  Propylene oxide is both toxic and flammable.  \n\nHercules has worked very close with  the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, the Dalton Fire Department, and Midsouth Metal to insure that the system was installed properly and meets and complies with all local, state, and federal safety and environmental regulations.  The process consists of a tanker unloading system, storage tank, weigh tank and a reactor.  The storage tank has a storage capacity of 10,000 gallons; however, inventory controls and safety procedures allow no more than 7,500 gallons of propylene oxide to be stored at any time.  \n\nPROCESS SAFETY DEVICES\n\nThe following devices are used throughout the system to ensure safe operation and quick response if an incident should occur:\n\nSTORAGE TANK AND TANKER UNLOADING AREA\n? Concrete dikes and berms around both the tanker unloading station and the storage tank to contain any accidental spills.\n? The storage tank area is equipped with a foam system for vapor suppression and fire protection should an accidental spill occur.\n? Both the storage tank and tanker unloading headers are equipped with dry disconnect valves to prevent spillage.\n? The pump transfer system is equipped with an emergency shutoff to ensure quick shutdown should a problem arise during the transfer from the tanker truck to the storage tank.\n? A nitrogen blanket of 5-10 psi will be maintained at all times on the storage tank.\n? Nitrogen will be used to purge all lines after unloading.\n\nREACTOR AND REACTOR AREA\n? The reactor will be pressurized (low pressure) and inspected for leaks on each and every Monday.\n? The reactor is equipped with both high pressure and high temperature process control alarms.\n? The reactor is isolated from all o"

This eliminates any possible ignition source should an accidental spill or vapor release occur.  \n? The reactor is also equipped with a computer system that will allow reactor activities to be monitored from any computer screen in the plant (engineer?s office, plant manager?s office, general manager?s office).\n? The reactor area is also equipped with several explosion proof exhaust fans which would ventilate the reactor and prevent the buildup of flammable vapors should an accidental spill occur.\n\nEMPLOYEE SAFETY TRAINING\n? Employees have participated in all aspects of the development and installation of the CMHPG reaction system.\n? All employees are trained in the proper safety and handling procedures of the propylene oxide.\n? All employees involved in the use of propylene oxide have received training which includes:\n      - Classroom training and discussion.\n      - Written exam and testing.\n      - On the job training.\n? All employees have been trained in emergency response and evacuation procedures should an incident occur.\n\nLOCAL AGENCY WITH WHICH FACILITY?S ER PLAN OR RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ARE COORDINATED:\n Name of Agency: Dalton Fire Department\n Telephone Number: (706) 278-7363\n\nRMP Validation Error/Warnings --- No Data to Report"
