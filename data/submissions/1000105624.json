Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nNuGen regularly conducts audits of the provisions of RMP and PSM to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed. A compliance audit of each program is conducted every three years. The audits include but are not limited to a review of documentation and process safety information, an inspection of the physical facilities, and interviews with all levels of plant personnel. The audit team develops findings that are included in an audit report and forwarded to facility management for resolution. Findings and corrective actions taken in response to each finding are tracked until completion.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at NuGen include hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The RMP Program elements that were previously summarized apply to the denaturant processes. Collectively, these program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that equipment failures and human errors could cause. In addition to RMP, the facility has instrumentation and equipment to detect, contain, and reduce the consequences of a release, including:\n\nRelease Detection \n\n-\tMonitoring equipment to detect flow and tank liquid level changes\n-\tVideo cameras are used to monitor the facility, including the storage tank area\n-\tFacility personnel conduct routine rounds through storage tank areas\n\n Release Containment/Control \n\n-\tAtmospheric relief devices\n-\tCheck valves to prevent the backflow of liquid\n-\tSafety interlocks\n-\tGrounding equipment to prevent electric discharges through the tank\n\n Release Mitigation \n\n-\tSecondary containment to contain liquid releases\n-\tFire suppression and extinguishing systems\n-\tTrained emergency response personnel\n-\tEmergency response equipment located onsite\n-\tFacility personnel r"

These safety standards control entry into work areas and confined spaces, specify procedures for isolating energy sources by lockout/tag-out, and describe the permitting process for completing work at NuGen. Safety standards and work procedures are reviewed annually. \n\nHot Work Permit\n\nNuGen has a hot work permit program that details areas that require a permit and those areas for which a permit is not required. A hot work permit is required in process areas for cutting, welding, spark-producing equipment, etc., except in designated areas. The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing the hot work permit, display of the permit at the site of the hot work until the work is completed, site inspection, designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work, and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nNuGen's MOC program reviews proposed changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, materials, and design conditions before implementation of the change. An interdisciplinary team reviews changes to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage new hazards and verify that a process change has not compromised existing controls. \n\nIncident Investigation\n\nNuGen has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in or could reasonably result in, a release of a regulated substance, fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental damage, or personal injury. The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program to reduce the likelihood of repetitive events that could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases.

The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: fire, explosion, contamination, and tornados. NuGen utilizes process controls such as relief valves, check valves, interlocks, and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases. NuGen also utilizes dike containment around the site\u2019s storage tanks, including the denaturant storage tank, to contain and mitigate liquid releases.\nNuGen keeps various technical documents onsite to help maintain the safe operation of the production process and provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and piping & instrument drawings.\n\nOperating Procedures and Training\n\nNuGen is responsible for developing and implementing written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with the RMP. The operating procedures were developed as a guide for those involved with an initial start-up, normal operation, normal shutdown, and emergency shutdown of the process. NuGen developed and implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in facility operations. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nAs part of the management of change (MOC) process, whenever a modification to the existing process is planned, either temporary or permanent, NuGen requires a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR). The PSSR confirms that, before putting into service, the construction and equipment being used are in accordance with design specifications. The PSSR also confirms that the safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and that adequate training for each involved employee has been completed.
