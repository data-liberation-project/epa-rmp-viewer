Facility accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\n     In this process and distribution facility, the plant handles propane and natural gas liquids (NGL) containing:\npropane, butane, iso-butane, iso-pentane, and pentane, which are considered hazardous by EPA.  The same properties that make propane and NGL valuable as a fuel also makes them necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling propane and NGL to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employees personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is the policy of HILCORP ENERGY COMPANY to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle propane and NGL combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling and procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n     Our emergency response program is based upon OSHA's Process Safety Management regulations.  The \nemergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local and state notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  Facility description and regulated substances handled:\n\n     The primary purpose of this facility is to process and distribute propane, natural gas liquids (NGL), and other products to wholesale customers.  Propane used in the refrigeration unit is stored in Tank 60, a horizontal pressurized tank.  The capacity of the propane tank is 21,000 gallons.  Product (NGL) is stored on site in D-2904, 3700 gallon surge drum; periodically, during upsets, NGL product can be stored on site in two 42,000 gallon horizontal pressurized storage tanks, Tank 61 and Tank 62, or the NGL can be stored in five (5) 100,002 gallon horizontal bullet tanks. \nNGL product is pumped into the Phillips Pipeline for distribution.
