The requirements are codified in 40 CFR 68, Subparts A \u0096 H. Under the ARP Program, a Stationary Source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process must comply with the requirements of the ARP provisions.\nThe \u0093List Rule\u0094 (under 40 CFR 68, Subpart C, and Tables 1 through 4 of 68.130) identifies regulated substance threshold quantities for determining ARP Program applicability. Threshold quantities have been established for flammable and toxic substances. The threshold quantity for all regulated flammables (Table 3 of the regulation) is 10,000 pounds. The threshold determination for mixtures of flammable substances is in accordance with 40 CFR 68.115(b) (2). In cases where the listed substance is greater than one percent by weight of the mixture (for a flammable),"

      "SummaryText": "the entire weight of the mixture is considered in the threshold determination, unless it can be demonstrated that the mixture itself does not have a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 4. The threshold quantity for regulated toxic substances listed on Table 1 of the regulation varies according to each substance and ranges from 500 \u0096 20,000 pounds.\nEach covered process regulated under the ARP Program is assigned as either a Program 1, 2, or 3 status and must meet the applicable criteria of the assigned program. Program 1 processes are those that meet the following criteria:\n\u00b7\tthe process has not had an accidental release in the past five years that resulted in an offsite consequence (i.e., injuries, deaths, or environmental damage);\n\u00b7\tthe distance to an endpoint is less than the distance to any public receptor; and\n\u00b7\tEmergency response has been coordinated with local emergency response organizations.\nProgram 3 processes meet the following criteria:\n\u00b7\tthe distance to an endpoint exceeds the distance to any public receptor; or\n\u00b7\tthe process has had an accidental release in the past five years resulting in an offsite consequence; and either.\n\u00b7\tFalls into one of ten NAICS codes [32211, 31411, 32511, 325181, 325188, 325192, 325199, 325211, 325311, and 32532]; or subject to the OSHA process safety management standard [40 CFR 68.10 (d) (2)].\nProgram 2 processes are those that do not meet Program 1 or 3 criteria.\n2.0\t\tStationary Source ARP Program Status Determination\n\t2.1.\tBackground\nEnergy Transfer Gulf Coast Operations is the owner/operator of the Stationary Source, Olefin grade (NGL) cryogenic unit, located at a latitude 29\u00b0 55' 54.22\" N and longitude 89\u00b0 57' 55.15\" W in Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana. \n\nThe primary function of the Stationary Source is mechanically removing through cryogenics means the regulated substances (NGL\u0092s) from the waste gas stream from the oil refinery, then returning the methane and butane to the refinery"

      "SummaryText": ". All other Olefin products, Ethylene, Propylene, Ethane, and Butane are recovered and sent out by pipeline.  \n\nBy virtue of the flammable effects associated with NGL\u0092s, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. \n\n2.2\t\tHazard Assessment\nThe Stationary Source was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of multiple processes. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\nThere are no regulated toxic substances at this Stationary Source more than RMP threshold quantities.\nThis Stationary Source does store regulated flammable substances in vessels that exceed threshold quantity; therefore, the Stationary Source is a covered process with regulated substances subject to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis (see Table 1).
