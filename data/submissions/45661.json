      "SummaryText": "Meadow Gold Dairies is completing construction of a new fluid milk plant (anticipated June 1, 2004).  The facility is state of art.  Saftey, Health and Environmental Programs have been developed well in advance of operation.  The State of Nevada regulates and audits facilities that store, use, or otherwise handle a threshold quantity of a listed hazardous chemical.  This facility is subject to the regulation because it will have an inventory of more than 5,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia to be used in the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is anticipated that the facility will operate with approximately 14,000 lbs of anhydrous ammonia; however, until the system is charged with anhydrous ammonia (expected to be June 3, 2004) the exact quantity will not be known.\n\nThe State of Nevada requires the owner to obtain a Permit to Construct prior to building a new facility meeting the threshold quantity of a listed hazardous chemical.  Under the requirement, construction cannot commence on any part of the equipment or piping involved in handling the subject hazardous chemical until the permit is obtained.  In order to receive the permit, it is required that most of the elements of the program be completed in advance.  Approximately three months were required to develop the program including the Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams, Process Hazard Analysis, Emergency Response, Worst Case and Alternate Case Scenarios and other parts of the Program.  After submittal to the State, the Permit to Construct was received about six months later.\n\nFollowing completion of construction, testing of Safety Systems, training, Pre-startup evaluation, etc., we expect to receive a Permit to Operate from the State.  At this point, Meadow Gold Dairies will charge the system with anhydrous ammonia.  The anticipated date to charge the system is June 3, 2004.\n\nThe Meadow Gold Dairy operation will fall under the regulations of The State of NV, Chemical Accident Prevention Branch.  This will include re"

Additionally, the State CAP Program is outstanding.  Thus, we can be assured that all elements of the Program will be well managed.\n\nThis facility will receive raw milk in over-the-road tankers from dairy co-operatives, unload inside a receiving room and store in 50,000 gallon silos.  Following testing and receipt of the raw milk, the milk will be processed and packaged into various container sizes (primarily gallon plastic jugs) and distributed to customers in the Las Vegas area.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia is used in the closed loop refrigeration system to cool the milk during processing and maintain the cooler room at approximately 34 degrees F. for storage of the packaged product.  The majority of the refrigeration system is located in the Engine Room.  From the Engine Room, cold ammonia is pumped through thick-walled insulated lines passing over the roof to the milk silos, air conditioning units and cooler room evaporators (blowers),  There are no ammonia valves inside the building (other than the Engine Room); however, lines to and from the cooler and blowmold room penetrate the roof to the blowers mounted near the ceiling of the rooms.  We obviously do not anticipate any release of ammonia.\n\nWe are very proud of our new plant, our ammonia refrigeration system and the CAP Program.  The Meadow Gold Dairy CAP Program is available for review by our employees or the public."
