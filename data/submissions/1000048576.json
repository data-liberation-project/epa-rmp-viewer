The commitment is demonstrated in the design, operation and maintenance programs developed and implemented specifically for this facility.  Operation and maintenance personnel are trained in the appropriate emergency response procedures to follow in the event of an accidental release.  However, accident prevention is the ultimate goal and, as such, a site-specific mechanical integrity program is being implemented and maintained.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant in located near Savageton in Campbell County, Wyoming.  It is a plant that is designed to extract natural gas liquids (ie. ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons) from raw natural gas stream to produce pipeline quality Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs).  The only process in the plant that contains and above the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in the NGL Storage Tanks.  There are no above threshold quantity toxic substances at the 50 Buttes Gas Plant. \n\n\n\nGERNRAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant has developed and implemented a site-specific PSM program that consists of all the required 14 elements of PSM.  Since this facility is a Program Level 1 facility, a prevention program is not required under RMP.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant has had no accidental releases in the past 5 years that have resulted in offsite consequences.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe 50 Buttes Gas Plant has developed and maintains a site-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that includes actions to take in the event of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance.  The ERP includes the name and phone numbers of not only company personnel but also the names and phone numbers of support services (contractors, police departments, fire departments, "

Meritage continues to look for, develop and implement programs that will improve an employee's ability to identify and correct potential workplace hazards. Meritage also endeavors to ensure policies, programs and procedures are developed and implemented to meet applicable laws, rules and regulations.
