      "SummaryText": "Facility Description and Summary\n\nNucor Steel- Berkeley (Nucor), a division of Nucor Corporation, owns and operates a scrap steel recycling facility in Huger, South Carolina.  The facility owns approximately 8000 acres of property along the Cooper River, approximately 20 miles northwest of Charleston, South Carolina.  This facility produces steel coils and beams primarily from steel scrap using the electric arc furnace process.\n\n\n\nFollowing Hurricane Katrina, hydrogen supply was impacted from a major manufacturing facility in New Orleans.  To minimize the impact on Nucor's Cold Mill, Nucor purchased and installed three ammonia dissociators to produce hydrogen.   As it is normally more cost effective to purchase hydrogen versus production, Nucor ceased operation of the ammonia dissociators once the hydrogen supply returned to normal.  As such, the RMP was de-registered in 2009.  The processes were placed on cold stand-by (with no ammonia storage) to be available in the future as an alternate hydrogen source for emergencies.  Recently, Nucor was notified by their supplier of an interruption in hydrogen production.  As such, Nucor has reviewed and revised the RMP for resubmittal.\n\n\n\nA Risk Management Program has been prepared and implemented for one 33,707 lb. capacity, mobile anhydrous ammonia tank truck located on the south side of the Galvanizing Line.  The anhydrous ammonia will be used to produce hydrogen for one galvannealing operation in the Cold Mill through one ammonia dissociator generator.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nNucor?s safety policy is that every employee is entitled to a safe place in which to work.  In order to accomplish this, we will provide all reasonable safeguards necessary to ensure a safe and healthy work environment.  Every employee is expected to follow the safety standards and procedures that apply to our operations.  \n\n\n\nA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been developed and implemented for t"

Process hazard and offsite consequence analyses were conducted for anhydrous ammonia storage, dissociator, and associated piping at the facility.   Process hazard and offsite consequence analyses were conducted for anhydrous ammonia storage at the facility.  In addition, the PSM and the incorporated Safety and Environmental Management Systems address each of the following elements:  employee participation, process safety information, risk reduction, operating procedures, employee training, contractor safety, pre-startup safety review, mechanical integrity, hot work permits, management of change, incident investigation, emergency planning and response, and compliance audits.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe ammonia tank truck and associated piping are easily accessible for routine operations, maintenance, and emergency response situations.  Equipment is examined during routine shift inspections and periodic tests, which conform to recognized and accepted good engineering practices. Inspection and test results are recorded in our electronic CMMS database.  Any deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  \n\n\n\nThe stationary tank truck will be stored close to the dissociator building and surrounded by barriers.  The tank truck is equipped with automatic shut-off valves and will be continuously monitored by video surveillance.  Area monitor with alarms will be located inside the dissociator building to detect any ammonia leaks.  Access to the facility is controlled 24/7 by guarded entrance gates.  Safety showers, eye wash stations, and emergency water spray system are strategically located near the tank truck and dissociator for emergencies.  Nucor Berkeley has an Emergency Response Team on-site at all times with access to emergency response equipment stored in a mobile HAZMAT vehicle.  A fire hydrant is located near the tank truck.  \n\n\n\nThe Local Emerge"

      "SummaryText": "ncy Planning Commission, the State Emergency Response Commission, and local police and fire departments have been notified of the anhydrous ammonia storage on-site.  The Cainhoy Fire Department would be contacted for assistance in the unlikely event of a large ammonia release at the facility.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nNucor implemented this Risk Management Program in 2005 with the installation of the anhydrous ammonia storage.  Nucor did not have any releases of anhydrous ammonia during the active use.   \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe existing Emergency Response Plan was modified to meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 to include information for anhydrous ammonia emergencies.  All aspects of emergency planning and response are addressed in the ICP including implementation of response procedures, containment and control provisions, emergency equipment, casualty control, evacuation plan, post-emergency procedures, and arrangements with local authorities.  Responsibilities and contact information for the Emergency Coordinator and other key personnel are identified for implementation of emergency planning and response procedures.   \n\n\n\nEmployees are provided proper training on chemical safety, hazard communication principles, emergency rally points, evacuation routes, and appropriate personal protective equipment. In the event of an emergency, it is every employee?s responsibility to contact their supervisor, health and safety, or environmental personnel immediately.  Emergency response personnel are trained on proper personal protective equipment, ammonia properties, and emergency response tactics.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nNucor will review procedures and inspect equipment regularly.  Follow-up actions to items found will be implemented in a safe and timely manner.  Based on the hazard analysis review, additional safety measures are planned such as barriers around the tank truck, enhancement of area monitors, and additional training for op"
