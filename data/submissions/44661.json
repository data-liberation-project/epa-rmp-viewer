Anhydrous ammonia is used as the refrigerant in an ammonia refrigeration system (ARS) at the plant.  Foremost Farms has a current OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program in place for their ARS.  The OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.119 lists the required elements of PSM and include process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, medchanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit, and contractors.  These elements are also required under Program 3 of the EPA Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68).  Foremost Farms maintains these elements for compliance with OSHA PSM and EPA Risk Management Program.  In addition to the prevention program elements listed above, Foremost Farms completes the other items required for EPA Risk Management Program.  These items include an Emergency Response Program, a Management System, a Hazard Assessment, and Submittal of the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The Emergency Response Program includes coordinating with a local emergency responder as well as maintaining an emergency response team on site.  The management system consists of the operations manager having overall responsibility for the Risk Management Program with support from the maintenance supervisor.  The hazard assessment including the off-site consequence analysis and 5-year accident history is completed in accordance with EPA guidance at the specified intervals.  Finally, the RMP was submitted prior to the EPA by June 21, 1999.  The RMP was updated in 2001 due to an accident that resulted in a revised PHA.  The RMP was again updated prior to June 21, 2004.  The RMP was again updated in 2005 upon discovery of a public receptor facility located within the worst case and alternative release radii.  The facility"
