Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\n\nThe primary activity involved at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe facility has a 1-30,000 gallon storage tank; 1-26,000 gallon storage tank; and 1-18,000 gallon storage tank for permanent storage capacity of approximately 373,000 pounds.  Additional storage of approximately 205,000 pounds is available in portable 1,450 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Dept. of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and 40 CFR part 68 as they apply to this facility. The facility is required to conduct semi-annual inspections of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance  found during the inspections. Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the facility.\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History:  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years"
