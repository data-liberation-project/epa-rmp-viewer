Cheney Brothers, Inc. currently employs over 1,400 personnel on a full or part time basis. Cheney Brothers, Inc. is the proud sponsor of many youth, civic, academic, and public organizations. \n \nCheney Brothers, Inc. has two existing state of the art refrigeration and warehouse facilities in Riviera Beach, Florida and Ocala, Florida. These facilities specialize in wholesale distribution of processed foods and dry goods.  The covered process for this Risk Management Plan (RMP) is anhydrous ammonia which is used as a refrigerant. \n \nCheney Brothers, Inc. has complied with the Occupational Safety and Health Safety Administration (OSHA) 29CFR191 0.119 Process Safety Management (PSM) for anhydrous ammonia. In preparing the PSM it was determined that there was not a general hazard to employees at the facility due to the fact that the ammonia is contained within the refrigeration system itself. The hazard is present to maintenance personnel when performing repairs or replacing valves, gauges, etc. on the system. This repair work is done in a very well controlled environment which isolates the repair section and reduces the amount of ammonia lost to a very minimum. Since the Riviera Beach facility refrigeration system is relatively new (approximately 10 years as of this this submittal) and in excellent working condition, it is estimated that less than 50 pounds of ammonia may been lost from the system per year due to maintenance. All Cheney Brothers, Inc. refrigeration maintenance personnel are well trained, certified by Mollenberg & Betz, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration systems.

Cheney Brothers, Inc. has the necessary emergency response personnel and equipment on-site to handle minor emergencies that may occur. In case of a major release Cheney Brothers, Inc. will implement its Emergency Evacuation Plan and inform the local police and fire departments of the situation. \n \nThe \"Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario - A \"Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" and an \"Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis\" were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the Cheney Brothers, Inc. building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\n \nFive-year accident history - There have been no reportable releases in the past five (5) years. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, Cheney Brothers, Inc. is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\n \nCheney Brothers, Inc. has developed a documented system of checks and balances for maintenance and inspection procedures that have been endorsed by everyone in the Cheney Brothers, Inc. Management Team from Byron C. Russell (CEO) through Danny Wells (Maintenance Director for both facilities) to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. Cheney Brothers, Inc. has an on going training program which updates personnel on a routine basis for changes, problems, and new technologies pertaining to ammonia refrigeration s"
