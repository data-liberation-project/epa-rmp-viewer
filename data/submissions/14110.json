It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling flammable substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle flammable substances combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Berry Petroleum Company are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Stephens Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled \n\nBerry Petroleum Company uses atmospheric distillation to separate crude oil into asphalt, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and two grades of naphtha - LSR heavy and LSR light.  The asphalt, diesel fuel, and jet fuel are not regulated under 40 CFR 68.  The LSR heavy and LSR light are regulated under 40 CFR 68 as a result of being mixtures containing regulated chemicals and the flash points and boiling points are less than 730F a"

Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the Berry Petroleum Company is pentane and propane.  The maximum quantity of pentane that can be stored at this facility is 1,000,000 pounds in three 41,000-gallon storage tanks and one 78,000-gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity of propane that can be stored at the facility is 37,000 pounds in one 10,500-gallon aboveground storage tank. \n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignition source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion.\n\nThe worst-case scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nBerry Petroleum Company worst-case release scenario would result in a release of 400,000 pounds of pentane.  To evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp\u0019, the EPA recommended software.  Based on 400,000 pounds of pentane released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud explosion is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 0.6-mile from the location of the storage tank.\n\nAccording to RMP regulations, an analysis is required on one flammable substance with the greatest endpoint distance"

      "SummaryText": ".  RMP*Comp\u0019 results indicate a worst-case release of 37,000 pounds of propane has a hazard endpoint distance of 0.3-mile.  Therefore, analysis is only required on pentane since the endpoint distance is greater.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternative release scenario.\n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is the failure of a flexible transfer hose while transferring pentane between a truck transport and a storage tank.  The flexible transfer hose has a nominal diameter of 3-inches.  Excess flow valves at the truck transport function to stop the flow of pentane out of the truck transport. \n\nIn this alternative release scenario, 20,600 pounds of pentane would be released before facility personnel could implement actions to stop the release.  RMP*Comp\u0019 modeled the distance endpoint for the release of 20,600 pounds of pentane to no longer pose a hazard to the public as 0.1-mile. \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nOur Berry Petroleum Company complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
