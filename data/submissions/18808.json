      "SummaryText": "    Executive Summary\n\nRelease Prevention and Response Policy\n\n    In an on-going effort to be prepared for emergencies and comply with the provisions of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 68, Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. is developing an Integrated Process Safety and Risk Management Plan for the poultry processing plant at Mifflintown, in Juniata County, Pennsylvania.  It is the policy of the Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. to operate all of the facilities within its jurisdiction in the safest and most efficient manner possible, with due regard for the health and safety of Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. employees, the Public, and our environment.\n\nStationary Source and Chemicals\n\n    The Plant employs ammonia as a refrigeration system working fluid, chlorine as a disinfectant for the wastewater surface water discharge, and propane as fuel for heating and cooking operations.  Bottled propane is delivered for use in forklifts.  The bottles are collected by the supplier and re-filled off-site.   The chlorine is delivered, stored, and drawn from a one-ton container which is limited to 1,000 pounds of chlorine, by contract with the supplier. The \"ton\" container is stored in a dedicated chlorination building.  Propane is stored in 1,000 pound horizontal \"bullet\" tanks for use in heating.  The ammonia and propane are delivered by tank truck.\n\n    The new ammonia refrigeration system is being installed in two phases.  The first phase will involve approximately 8,000 pounds of ammonia.  The second stage will increase the amount of ammonia to the maximum inventory of 13,000 pounds.  This Program has been prepared in anticipation of the ultimate conditions.\n\nRelease Scenarios\n\n    For the Plant a worst case assumed an accidental release of 13,000 pounds of ammonia  during 10 minutes at 0 feet elevation and 103 degrees Fahrenheit, with an atmospheric stability class F.  The wind speed during class F conditions is calm to 1.5 meters per second or 3.5 miles per hour.\n\n    The Alternative sc"

The operating and maintenance personnel are trained in the proper operation, maintenance, connection-disconnection, and emergency response for the chemicals employed at the Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. plant.  With regard to chlorine and propane, the two chemicals are present in quantities less than threshold, but Process Safety Management and Risk Management procedures have been performed in compliance with the General Duty Clause.\n\n    All gas-containing tubing and control devices are selected for specific material compatibility and compliance with appropriate Codes and Standards, and Current Best Engineering Practice.  The systems are regularly and routinely inspected, and maintenance or replacement is performed as appropriate.\n\nAccident History\n\n    To date, there have been no known accidental ammonia, chlorine, or propane releases from the  Plant, resulting in either on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n    The Emergency Response Program is based on the use of Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. Plant employees who are trained to respond to, and control, an accidental release of ammonia or chlorine.  The employees are trained in the use of personal protective equipment and specialized maintenance and repair procedures.\n\n    The current Emergency Response Plan is undergoing extensive review and revision.  The ERP is closely coordinated with the Juniata County emergency response organizations."
