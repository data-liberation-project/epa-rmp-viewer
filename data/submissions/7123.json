If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Hoffman Fire Department, or other authorities, to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery \nto the farm for application. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 468,000 lbs. in one 27,000, three 1500 , and, twenty six 1000, gallon tanks.  The maximun quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case senerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes.  The maximum quanity would be 118,000 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank  capacity, as limited by design standards.   \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint in this case would be .62 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia in the past five years at this site.\n\nHoffman Coop Oil Association has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38; provided state and local authorities with emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPRCA).\n"
