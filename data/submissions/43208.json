Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nHi-Temp, Incorporated is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. We have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place. This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release should occur, our emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of such a release.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nHi-Temp, Incorporated is a commercial heat treating service utilizing continuous electric and gas heated furnaces to perform multiple manufacturing processes on customers parts. Manufacturing processes include hardening of 410 stainless steel; annealing of all types of steel and cast iron; tempering & stress relieving; copper, silver & nickel brazing; passivating of stainless steel; copper stripping and aqueous washing. In addition zinc electroplating and zinc phosphating processes are also performed.\n\nHi-Temp, Incorporated consists of three plants located on one contiguous piece of property. The plants house offices, manufacturing operations and storage. Plant #1 is located at 310 S. Wolf Road, Northlake, IL. Plant #2 is located at 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake. Plant #3 is located at 5400 W. Lake Street, Melrose Park, IL. The mailing address of the facility is 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake, IL 60164.\n\nProcess 1 ? Plant #1: Air Permit Operating 73070248\nThe property of Plant #1 is bounded by Bristol Hose & Fittings, located at 311 W. Lake Street to the North, the Union Pacific Railroad to the South and East, and M. Holland Company, 21 W.

It is a gas that is liquefied under pressure. It is delivered, installed by transfer hose, and stored on site in steel tanks in this liquid form. There are two (2) tanks. One 13,000 gallon tank, and one 1,000 gallon tank. The tanks are constructed of steel and are approximately 1 .5? thick.

If this maximum quantity of ammonia (68,208 lbs.) was simultaneously released from both tanks, the resulting denser-than-air vapor would release at ground level with a toxic endpoint distance of 2.3 miles. This distance extends past the property boundaries and would affect the surrounding population of 19,000.

Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\nProcess 1 ? Plant #1: Ammonia, anhydrous\n\nProcess 2 ? Plant #2: Ammonia, anhydrous\n\nAn accidental release of ammonia for both processes would more likely occur as a result of a transfer hose failure. This type of release would occur at the time of receiving new quantities of ammonia and having the facility?s ammonia tanks refilled. The transfer hose is 2? in diameter and is 22? long. If there were a failure in this hose, the resulting ammonia release would only involve the quantity of ammonia that existed within the transfer hose. This quantity is 22 pounds of ammonia.\n\nWith this size of an ammonia release, the resulting toxic distance endpoint is <0.1 miles. This would not extend past the property boundaries, therefore, this type of ammonia release would not generate a public health emergency.\n\n    Assumptions and Calculations follow (OCA Guidance):\n\n    RMP*CompVer 1.07\n\n    Results of Consequence Analysis\n\n    Chemical: Ammonia, anhydrous\n    CAS #: 7664-41-7\n    Category: Toxic Gas\n    Scenario: Alternative Case\n    Liquefied under pressure\n    Release Duration: 10 minutes\n    Release Rate: 22 pounds per minute\n    Mitigation Measures: Release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air\n\n    Topography: Urban surroundings (many obstacles in immediate area)\n    Toxic Endpoint: 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\n    Estimated Distance to toxic endpoint: : <0.1 miles (<0.16 kilometers)\n\n\n    - - - - - - Assumptions About This Scenario- - - - - - -\n    Wind Speed: 3.0 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour)\n    Stability Class: D\nAir Temperature: 77?
