      "SummaryText": "Hi-Temp, Incorporated\nExecutive Summary\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nHi-Temp, Incorporated is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. We have a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place. This program covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. In the unlikely event that a release should occur, our emergency response personnel are trained to control and mitigate the effects of such a release.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\nHi-Temp, Incorporated is a commercial heat treating service utilizing continuous electric and gas heated furnaces to perform multiple manufacturing processes on customers parts. Manufacturing processes include hardening of 410 stainless steel; annealing of all types of steel and cast iron; tempering & stress relieving; copper, silver & nickel brazing; passivating of stainless steel; copper stripping and aqueous washing. In addition zinc electroplating and zinc phosphating processes are also performed.\n\nHi-Temp, Incorporated consists of three plants located on one contiguous piece of property. The plants house offices, manufacturing operations and storage. Plant #1 is located at 310 S. Wolf Road, Northlake, IL. Plant #2 is located at 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake. Plant #3 is located at 5400 W. Lake Street, Melrose Park, IL. The mailing address of the facility is 75 E. Lake Street, Northlake, IL 60164.\n\nProcess 1 \u00bf Plant #1: Air Permit Operating 73070248\nThe property of Plant #1 is bounded by Bristol Hose & Fittings, located at 311 W.

Alternative Case Release Scenario\n\nProcess 1 \u00bf Plant #1: Ammonia, anhydrous\n\nProcess 2 \u00bf Plant #2: Ammonia, anhydrous\n\nAn accidental release of ammonia for both processes would more likely occur as a result of a transfer hose failure. This type of release would occur at the time of receiving new quantities of ammonia and having the facility\u00bfs ammonia tanks refilled. The transfer hose is 2\u00bf in diameter and is 22\u00bf long. If there were a failure in this hose, the resulting ammonia release would only involve the quantity of ammonia that existed within the transfer hose. This quantity is 22 pounds of ammonia.\n\nWith this size of an ammonia release, the resulting toxic distance endpoint is <0.1 miles. This would not extend past the property boundaries, therefore, this type of ammonia release would not generate a public health emergency.\n\n\tAssumptions and Calculations follow (OCA Guidance):\n\n\tRMP*CompVer 1.07\n\n\tResults of Consequence Analysis\n\n\tChemical: Ammonia, anhydrous\n\tCAS #: 7664-41-7\n\tCategory: Toxic Gas\n\tScenario: Alternative Case\n\tLiquefied under pressure\n\tRelease Duration: 10 minutes\n\tRelease Rate: 22 pounds per minute\n\tMitigation Measures: Release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air\n\n\tTopography: Urban surroundings (many obstacles in immediate area)\n\tToxic Endpoint: 0.14 mg/L; basis: ERPG-2\n\tEstimated Distance to toxic endpoint: : <0.1 miles (<0.16 kilometers)\n\n\n\t- - - - - - Assumptions About This Scenario- - - - - - -\n\tWind Speed: 3.0 meters/second (6.7 miles/hour)\n\tStability Class: D\nAir Temperature: 77\u00b0 F (25\u00b0 C)\n\t- - - - - - - - - - -"
