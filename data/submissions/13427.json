      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE BETASSO WTP AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nUnited Sates Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations, promulgated on June 20, 1996 under the Clean Air Act, require facilities that have a regulated substance above the listed threshold quantities to develop a formal Risk Management Program (RMProgram) and to register and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan).  The RMP rule regulates 140 chemical for their toxic or flammable characteristics.  Of the chemicals regulated, one or more of the following typically triggers RMP requirements at water treatment plants (threshold quantities noted in parentheses) : Chlorine (2,500 pounds);  anhydrous ammonia (10,000 pounds);  aqueous ammonia (20,000 pounds); and chlorine dioxide, (1,000 pounds).  If any of these chemicals are handled, stored, or used above the threshold quantity, the water treatment plant (WTP) is subject to the RMP rule.  The City of Boulder's Betasso WTP uses chlorine above the 2,500 lb. threshold quantity and therefore must prepare a RMProgram.\n\nThe chlorine room is equipped to store twenty, one-ton containers.  Ten chlorine cylinders are on scales (five per manifold) and hooked up to feed and the remainder are on the floor on permanent trunnions.  The maximum chlorine inventory is 40,000 lbs.  Each manifold is equipped with a regulator, chlorine gas filter, and and a heat-traced trap leg and connected to an automatic switch-over valve.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of the Betasso WTP Risk Management Program.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe purpose of the RMP rule is to lesson the number of serious chemical accidents that could affect public health and the environment, and also to improve the response to those accidents that do occur and thereby reduce the severity of the chemical accident.  Operators and management at the Betasso WTP have several measures already in place, and have initiated other meaures a"

In fact, to date there has not been any accidental chlorine releases at the facility since the building was constructed.\n\nAll operators at the WTP are trained in operating the chlorine process, and follow all appropriate safety procedures.  Both management and staff are committed to ensuring safety at the WTP.  Training and safety meetings are held on a regular basis.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Betasso facility follows all recommended safety, design, and operational and maintenance guidelines developed by the Chlorine Institute.  In addition, refresher training is routinely conducted.\n\nThe chlorine containers are stored in an enclosed building that meets 1994 Uniform Fire Code requirements, including the installation of a 1-ton chlorine scrubber.  The scrubber is connected to the chlorine room by a 20\" fiberglass vent through the wall which has an intake approximately 12-inches off the floor.  The scrubber is activated upon alarm from the chlorine monitors, or can be manually started.   One chlorine monitor is located in the chlorine feed room and the other monitor is located in the 1-ton container storage room.  A third monitor is located in the exhaust stack of the chlorine scrubber to monitor scrubber performance.\n\nWORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nFor the Betasso WTP's chlorine process, the worse-case release quantity is 2,000 lbs., i.e. the capacity of a 1-ton container.  As defined by the RMP rule, the worst-case release scenario for toxic gases (such as chlorine) to be modeled is\n\n\"For regulated toxic substances that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the owner or operator shall assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe, is released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The release rate shall be assumed to be the total quantity divided by 10 unless passive mitiga"

      "SummaryText": "tion systems are in place.\"\n\nTherefore, the worst-case release rate for chlorine at Betasso is 200 lbs. per minute.  Although the chlorine vessels are kept indoors, based on recommendations made in RMP guidance manuals, passive mitigation from the building was not included in the worst-case release scenario because the cylinders are unloaded outside the building upon delivery to the site and therefore the cylinders are some times outdoors.  As required, the worst-case scenario release was assumed to take place at ground level.  The toxic endpoint for chlorine for modeling the worst-case release is 0.0087 mg/L (3 ppm).  Note, that a guidance manual (versus a site-specific model) was used to estimate the chlorine release distance to toxic endpoint and therefore the estimated release distance of 3.07 miles is considered to be a very conservative number.\n\nAlternative release scenarios are intended to reflect more likely releases than the worst-case release scenario.  Program 2 facilities, such as the Betasso WTP, are required to evaluate and present at least one alternative release scenario.  For alternative release scenarios, both active and passive mitigation systems can be taken into consideration.  In this analysis, the chlorine scrubber at the Betasso WTP was included.  For the alternative-release scenario, failure of 5/16-inch pigtail tubing connected to a single 1-ton container was considered.  From the \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\" manual Exhibit 4-15, the chlorine vapor release rate from this scenario would be 15 lbs/minute.  The maximum duration was assumed to be 60 minutes, which should be ample time for a plant operator or the fire department to respond and stop the release.  The total chlorine release from this scenario would be 900 lbs.  Because the plant has a scrubber with a 2,000 lb capacity, the release to the environment is anticipated to be minimal and is not anticipated to migrate beyond the boundary of the site."

The plant has a five-member safety committee that meets once per month.  \n\nThe next few paragraphs provide a brief summary of emergency response operations.  When an alarm sounds, the operator in charge, within one minute, will notify plant personnel via the P.A. system that he or she is checking on the alarm.  He or she will also specifically designate other plant personnel to call 911 if no follow-up page occurs within five minutes.  The operator in charge will then investigate to verify the alarm condition.  If it is a false alarm, or small controllable leak, the operator in charge will notify plant personnel that the situation is under control.  For this type of non-emergency controllable leak, two trained personnel plus a supervisor, from that point forward, must be present to do the leak repair and  investigation.  The plant has written procedures that personnel are to follow for donning personal protection equipment and stopping and repairing the leak.  Under no circumstances will an employee act alone to correct a potentially hazardous chemical leak.  The proper authorities will be notified in the event more than the reportable quantity (2 lbs. chlorine) is released.  The facility manager will designate an individual to call Local, State, and Federal authorities.\n\nIf the operator in charge discovers that the leak is uncontrollable, or a fire or flood, he or she will inform plant staff to stop work immediately and to assemble in the primary staging area (i.e. the Administration Building Lobby).  The operator in charge will then call a supervisor and 911.  A large (2,000 lbs. or more) chlorine leak emergency will require Lev"

The site plan, wind direction, and windsocks will be utilized to evacuate personnel to either a cross wind or upwind location.\n\nAll personnel involved with an Emergency Response are required to participate in a debriefing procedure that includes the following steps:  (1) evaluation of the effectiveness of the plan;  (2) the facility manager determining if the proper procedures were carried out;  (3)  interviews of responders and follow-up non-responders;  (4) identification of response deficiencies, including items overlooked or not effective;  and (5) assemby of a planning team to reveiw comments and make appropriate revisions to the plans.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe primary changes that have been made as a result of implementing an RMProgram are greater staff and management awareness and commitment to safety."
