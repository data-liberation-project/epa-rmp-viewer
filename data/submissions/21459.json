This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety and environmental consequences in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy (See attached Health, Environmental and Safety Policy) is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated and non-regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant, located in Rayne, Louisiana, operates Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Fractionation Plant six miles north of the town of Rayne, Louisiana on the eastern side of State Highway 35, at 220 Nile Road, in Acadia Parish. The Rayne Fractionation Plant processes demethanized NGL to remove CO2 and separate NGL products (ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline). NGL products are shipped via pipelines.\n\nThe Rayne Plant includes the following facilities: Incoming and outgoing pipelines, fractionation processing facilities, storage tanks, wastewater ponds, on-site maintenance and fabrication shops, control room, an office building, and ancillary i"

Additionally, the plant uses hydrochloric acid, 30% concentration or greater, which is also a regulated toxic substance.\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant is situated on approximately 35 total acres, of which 25 acres are developed into plant process areas. The Rayne Fractionation Plant is bordered by Nile Road on the north and east. A Columbia Gulf natural gas compressor station lies on the western boarder, and farmland utilized for growing rice borders the Rayne Fractionation Plant to the south.\n\nThe coordinates of the Rayne Fractionation Plant is 30?, 19', 19\" N Latitude and 92 ?, 15', 49\" Longitude measured at the center of the facility. See plot plan below.\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with toxic materials in Program 3 processes at the Rayne Fractionation Plant involves a release of the entire contents of the hydrochloric acid storage tank into a diked area.  No administrative controls were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.   The worst-case toxic release for hydrochloric acid resulted in a 0.74 mile distance to the endpoint.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) associated with toxic materials in Program 3 processes at the Rayne Fractionation Plant involves the release of 8.4 pounds per minute of hydrochloric acid over a 60-minute period due to a 1\" leak at the 35% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution storage tank. No administrative controls were taken into account in evaluating this scenario. Under alternative release conditions, the alternative-case release of hydrochloric acid resulted in a 0.20 mile distance to the endpoint.  \n\nThe WCS for the flammable materials at the Rayne Fractionation Plant involves the release of 527,000 pounds of hydrocarbons over a 10 minute period due to the failure of feed st"

Under worst-case conditions, the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) at a distance up  to 0.66 miles. \n\nThe ARS for flammable material at the Rayne Fractionation Plant involves the release of 50,800 pounds of hydrocarbons over a 5-minute period due to a 2\" pipe leak at the feed storage tank. Under alternative release conditions, the resulting vapor cloud explosion could cause an overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) at a distance up to 0.30 miles. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant has had an excellent record of accident prevention over the past 5 years. None of the events that have occurred over the past five years have resulted in offsite effects. We investigate every incident very carefully to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from recurring. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release/Chemical-Specific Prevention Programs Steps\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Rayne Fractionation Plant. Because the processes at the Rayne Fractionation Plant that are regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant provides for and encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the Rayne Fractionation Plant accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees c"

These initiatives including forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the Rayne Fractionation Plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to -date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets. For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level; composition) in the operating procedures. The Rayne Fractionation Plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). A more complete description of process hazards and associated controls is provided in the Summary of Process Hazards, Safety Features, and Hazard Analysis Fi"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution "

These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Rayne Fractionation Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an area-qualified operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the "

A11 of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, the Rayne Fractionation Plant evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Rayne Fractionation Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\n\nThe Rayne Fractionation Plant conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information that exceeds $5O,OOO or otherwise deemed necessary by local management. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.
