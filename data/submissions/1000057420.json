The raw water pumping station is located on the bank of the Ohio River, while the treatment plant, which is where the chlorination facilities and storage area is located, is on higher ground. The raw water is pumped up to the WTP site on University Blvd., and stored in a 6,000,000 raw water reservoir for treatment. Steubenville has a population of 18,000 people as of the most recent US census. The plant is located on the edge of several residential areas.\n\n\n\nThe City of Steubenville, Ohio Water treatment Plant, located at 1575 University Drive, Steubenville, Ohio uses chlorine to disinfect the public water supply. The chlorine is stored in the chlorine feed room at the WTP. A maximum of three cylinders, containing one ton of liquid chlorine each are located inside the room. Approximately 130 pounds is fed each day, on average. The maximum amount stored at any time is three, one-ton cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe threshold for an RMP is 2500 pounds stored, or more. As stated above, the maximum stored at the Steubenville facility would be 6000 pounds.\n\n\n\nTwo cylinders are attached to the feed equipment at a time. The others are in storage. Two feed lines are active at any given time currently. (Feed point 1 is the Superpulsator Effluent Troughs, and Point 2 is a vault where the filter effluent enters the clearwell.)\n\nOne cylinder is feeding at a time. Once it is depleted, the cylinder switches to the full one, and the operators swap out the empty one for another full cylinder. (This is a recent change. Switching to the new cylinder was done manually until the third quarter of 2018.)\n\n\n\nIn the past, employees were provided training in chlorine emergencies, (Hazwopper) and it is anticipated the training will again be conducted this year. (2019) Arrangements for the training are pending at this time for 2019.\n\n\n\nThere is leak"

SCBA,s (4 units) are on hand, as well as a ton cylinder repair kit. The gaskets in the cylinder repair kit are replaced annually, in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. The room is checked hourly to be certain all is well. The weight of the cylinder is recorded each hour, as the cylinder sits in a cradle on a scale for weight measurement.There are policies in place for worker safety, and MSDS sheets are posted for this chemical. Hot Work policies are in place, and there is never any work going on with regard to the chlorine cylinder(s), feed equipment, or feed lines without two persons being present.\n\n\n\nMaintenance of the feed equipment, leak detection equipment, feed lines, SCBAs, the ton cylinder repair kit, feed lines, and all other associated equipment is maintained as per manufacturers recommendations.\n\n\n\nThe WTP is located near to residential areas, as well as a City Park, and a University. (The City of Steubenville most recent census data indicates a total population of approximately 18,000 people.) In the event of a leak/release, there are procedures for public notification. There is a group dial fax, as well as an email group message in use at the WTP for public notifications, with media outlets included as recipients. The City is served by one newspaper, the Herald Star, as well as a television station, WTOV9, and a radio station, Froggy 103FM. All precautions are taken to insure there are no accidental releases or leaks and to discover any problems that do occur as early as possible.\n\n\n\nThere has never been an incident at the Steubenville water treatment facility that has caused injury to any employee, nor has there been an incident that has caused any off-site impact. Small leaks during cylinder changes have occurred, and were corrected immediately, after having been spotted by checking at the time the cylinder was being placed into "
