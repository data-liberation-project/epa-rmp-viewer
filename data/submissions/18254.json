              "Description": "TDI is unloaded into a storage tank from a tank truck. The unloading operation is carried out in the presence of an operator.  In the event of a leak, the operator will be able to immediately respond with proper safety gear to shut the valve of the tank truck to stop any leak.  The spillage material will be contained in a near by sump.  The quantity of this kind of spillage will be many fold less than the conservative estimate presented in the alternate scenario.  A much smaller than the above leak could occur while pumping TDI from the storage tank to the Karate process reactor.  The pump is connected with a DCS control system with a slow charge timer/counter.  If the timer detects longer than the normal time to pump TDI from the storage tank to the process reactor then the pump will be automatically shut-down.  In the worst case scenario, the tank ruptures and spills all the stored TDI in the tank.  The tank is located in a diked area connected with a sump.  This sump will contain all the spilled material.  There are fire monitors around the TDI storage and unloading areas.  These monitors spray water and/or foam when activated.  Also, Preventive maintenance is being carried out on a periodic basis on the critical equipment.",

      "SummaryText": "LDEQ FACILITY ID:  4418\n\nZeneca site in St. Gabriel, Louisiana produces agricultural herbicides products, safener compunds and an insecticide product.  \nThe plant uses one listed chemical in the EPA's Risk Management Plan that meets the minimum storage quantities for reporting.  This chemical is Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI).  TDI is a liqiud at normal room temeprature.  The vapor is irritating to the eyes and skin, and to the respiratory system when inhaled. \n\nZeneca uses TDI as an ingredient in the formulation of the herbicides, for example, TopNotch and FulTime.  These are utilized to control insects and weeds in corn crops.  TDI is also used in the formulation of insecticides, for example, Karate Z.  Karate Z is utilized to control insects which attack cotton and other crop.  Herbicides and insecticides increase the amount of crops that farmers can grow, thus lowering costs to the consumer for items like food and clothing. \n\nOur worst case scenario is the release of 68,000 Ibs of Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) from one tank over a 10-minute period.  The distance potentially affected is 0.19 miles (0r 1,000 ft).\n\nZeneca's alternative planning scenario for TDI is a 750 gallon (or 7723 Ibs) release from a pipeline failure or other equipment failure.  The area potentially affected is 0.06 miles (or 320 ft), which does not go beyond our plant boundaries.  As such, it does not affect any public or environmental receptors.\n\nReviewing Zeneca's operational history over the last five years shows no incidents which are reportable under the EPA RMP guidelines.\n\nZeneca employees worked safely over 21 years with no lost time incident.  This remarkable achievement reflects that the best available safety programs are being practiced here in the plant.  This entails safe design of the equipment, safe construction, rigorous inspections of critical instruments and vessels, control systems (alarms, interlocks, monitoring fail-safe systems, among others), and operating the plant to protect"

      "SummaryText": " employees, the community and the environment.\n\nThe Zeneca Board has, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officers of the businesses, set down nineteen Zeneca Safety, Health and Environmental (SHE) standards to define basic management requirements to meet the SHE policies throughout Zeneca.   One of the nineteen standard is the Audit.  Through management, operation and specialist audits, we assure ourselves that systems are in place, technically correct, being operated properly and achieving the desired results.\n\nAll employees have extensive safety training, particularly in the emergency response area.  Emergency response drills are being held periodically to ensure that responders are proficient in the use of mitigation systems and the notification procedures are followed.  We work in conjunction with the LEPC and participate in the activation of the community Alert and Notification (CAN) System.  We are a member of the Geismer Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) and the Baton Rouge Area Mutual Aid (BRAMAS) organizations.\n\nShould an accident happen, the plant is equipped with fixed fire-fighting systems including sprinklers, monitors, foams, hoses, fire extinguishers, as well as emergency shut-down and fire-safety systems.\n\nZeneca has submitted a Title V air permit application to Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, but an permit has not yet been issued.\n\nFor more details regarding Zeneca's Risk Management programs or for specific information concerning this chemical, or any Zeneca's products, please contact Shafi Islam at 225-642-2218, Sharon Turner at (225) 642-2297 or Mike Maher at (225) 642-2296."
