O'Laughlin Municipal Water Plant, located at 5815 Buffalo Avenue, Niagara Falls, New York is a municipal drinking water treatment plant that treats and delivers an average of 17.9 million gallons per day of safe, clean drinking water. We are committed to operating and maintaining our treatment processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We implement a combination of accidental release prevention programs together with the Niagara Falls Water Board's Emergency Response Plan to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.\n\n\n\nOur facility uses Chlorine as a disinfectant in the water treatment process. Chlorine is brought into the facility in one-ton cylinders and is stored in our chlorine storage building that can store up to 15 one-ton cylinders. The building is equipped with a sodium hydroxide scrubber system that is used to neutralize and mitigate a release of chlorine in the building. \n\n\n\nThe following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release are used in our treatment process:\n\n\n\nToxics:\n\nChlorine - one-ton cylinders; maximum of 15 on site\n\n\n\nFlammables:\n\nNone\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs, spill prevention best management practices and our contingency planning efforts enable us to effectively manage potential hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals. Our emergency response procedures and the community emergency response plan address reasonable contingency case and we take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our process management system addresses each key feature of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n\n\n Process safety information\n\n Process hazard analysis\n\n Operating procedures\n\n Training\n\n Mechanical integrity\n\n Management of change\n\n Pre-star"

Our leadership team and our employees are committed to the standard that the management system sets for the way we do business, and we employ specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accidental release prevention. \n\n\n\nWe maintain records for significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility and are proud to report that no significant releases have occurred at our facility during the past five years. \n\n\n\nThe Niagara Falls Water Board's Emergency Response Plan and the Emergency Response Plan for Public Water Treatment Systems together address the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.
