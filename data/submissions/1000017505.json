Remote monitoring and maintenance and administrative support will be provided to the Desert Peak II facility from the Brady Geothermal control room. The Desert Peak II facility will operate continuously 24 hours a day and 365 days of the year (excluding scheduled maintenance downtime or plant upsets).\n \nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nDesert Peak II stores n-pentane (CAS # 109-66-0) as the motive fluid used in the Ormat Energy Converter (OEC) units. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119 the use of n-pentane as a process or motive fluid in a quantity greater than 10,000 lbs requires the establishment of a PSMP, CAPP and RMP. The total projected amount of n-pentane to be stored on site is 260,133 pounds. \n \nWorst Case Scenario: Worst case scenario assessment has been made and potential off-site consequence analysis (OCA) was undertaken. However, in conformance with Office of Emergency Management guidance, the OCA for worst-case and/or alternative release scenario(s) has not been included in this Executive Summary because of security concerns.\n\nSafe Work Practices: Safe work practices have been developed and implemented to provide for the control of hazards during work activities such as lock out/tag-out, confined space entry, opening process equipment or piping, and control over entrance into a facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to both employees and contractors.\n\nMaintenance Procedures: A Mechanical Integrity Program (MIP) has been developed for the Desert Peak II facility. The MIP adopted a maintenance concept for periodic preventative and corrective maintenance of the OEC system. The preventative maintenance tasks include visual inspection, lubrication of rotating parts, system cleaning, replacing liquids and filters, and periodic tests to verify that the system is in proper operating condition"

Standard Operating Procedure, Maintenance Instructions will identify system maintenance procedures, frequencies and recommended spare parts.\n\nTraining: Initial training for personnel is given before that employee is allowed to either handle n-pentane, operate or work on the facility's process area or on process equipment. Initial training shall be completed with Emergency Services Personnel including a tour of the site, gas and fire detection system operations, and familiarization with the motive fluid characteristics.  \n\nRefresher training is conducted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and when review of the chemicals or process(es) reveals a need for additional training. Initial and refresher training, associated with the RMP program, is documented and maintained per the requirements of the Training. Additional training is also  provided as needed or requested by Emergency Services Personnel. Contracted employees, shall be trained in the requirements of the EAP procedure prior to working at the Desert Peak II site. Training includes the following items, but is not limited to: (a) Location and sounds of the gas, fire, and evacuation alarms and detectors; (b) Expectations of response to injuries and emergencies by personnel on site, and in the Brady Geothermal Control Room; and (c) Evacuation routes and locations. Refresher training for all personnel shall be conducted annually at a minimum.\n\nSafety Training: Some equipment at the Desert Peak II Geothermal Power Plant poses potential fire, explosion, and electrical hazards that could cause serious personal injuries and costly property damage if safety procedures are not followed correctly.

The facility has a fire water system setup in a continuous loop around the generating units and within reach of the n-pentane storage tank. The fire water systems consist of fire monitors and hydrants. Operators are trained in the proper use of the installed fire protection equipment, and the training information is appropriately documented by the facility operator.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) including Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, an external events analysis and a preliminary human factors analysis was undertaken in July 2006. The recommendations of the PHA were integrated into the facility and facility operations. The PHA will be updated and revalidated at least every 5 years to ensure the study is consistent for the life of the pentane processes. \n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents associated with pentane and no accidental releases of pentane.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is intended to identify and coordinate personnel in the event there is an emergency.

Under no circumstances is any person to put himself/herself in danger. A General Response and Action Chart has been prepared to provide guidance on the initial response and follow up actions in the event of a pentane gas, smoke or fire detection alarm.\n\nImplementation, Control and Compliance: The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Emergency Action Plan. The Emergency Action Plan shall be reviewed annually to verify regulatory compliance and accuracy with both OSHA Regulations on Emergency Plans 29, CFR 1910.38 and CAPP's Emergency Response Programs, NAC 459.9544.

The senior employee on site at the time of the incident will give a report to the person in charge of the emergency teams.  This report will include currently known causes and effects, reports of injured personnel and their locations, etc.  If any employee is unconscious, the Facility Administrative Assistant, if available, will make that employee's medical questionnaire available to EMT personnel.  All other employees are instructed to stay clear unless specifically requested to assist in some manner.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe plant has been operating safely for many years and Ormat will continue to ensure extensive training is provided to the operators as they are essential to plant safety.\nIn addition, Ormat will evaluate any new mitigation or control technology that may improve safety at the Desert\nPeak II Power Plant."

The PLC receives all discrete (logic) and analog signals from the input devices (e.g.  switches and measuring sensors), processes the signals according to pre-loaded Ormat software, and then outputs logic and analog command signals to local and field devices. All parameters needed for proper operation of the OEC units, such as pressure, temperature, voltage, current, power, speed, etc. are measured by the proper measuring instruments.  Deviation from the operating parameters will immediately be detected by the PLC and the PLC will initiate correction or automatic shutdown of the related OEC unit. Under normal circumstances, no releases or other dangerous situations are expected to result from these automatic actions. Appropriate manual override is provided.\n\nRelief system design: Relief valves are located on the n-pentane storage tank and on the OEC vaporizers and condensers. Each pressure relief valve relieves directly to atmosphere, and some installations have extension pipes installed to direct the relief valve discharge away from critical machinery. Additionally, each pressure relief valve is installed immediately above a rupture disk designed to fail at the relief pressure of"
