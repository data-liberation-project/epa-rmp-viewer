      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Toledo Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this facility because the facility is operated as a retail operation and is exempt from the OSHA standards.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\n\n\n\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the Toledo Facility located approximately 3.5 miles north of Toledo at 1231 County Road 1050N, Toledo, IL 62468.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Toledo Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Toledo Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\n\n\n\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\n\n\n\nHelena recently acquired this Facility and has submitted this 5-Year update to reflect the new ownership.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).\n\n\n\nFACILITY\n\n\n\nThe Toledo Facility is a retail agricultural chemical facility and operates one (1) covered process that includes the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (9,000 gallon) and then transferred to a single 30,000-gallon stationary storage tank.  The com"

      "SummaryText": "mercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \n\n\n\nHelena stores the anhydrous ammonia in its single on-site storage tank and then transfers the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks at point of retail sale to the end user (e.g. the farmer).  This Facility owns and operates ten (10) 1,450-gallon nurse tanks.  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its Risk Management Program that includes a prevention program.  \n\n\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nWorst case and alternative case consequence analyses were completed for the ammonia storage and filling process. The worst case scenario release for the Retail Facility assumed that all the contents in the largest single storage tank were released.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of ammonia was modeled as a ground level horizontal jet.\n\n\n\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario assumes a rupture of a 3-inch line caused by an impact from a vehicle or some other source on the liquid ammonia transfer line during a major loading or unloading operation.  Although this event is classified as an alternative scenario, even an accident of this type is unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (excess flow devices, check valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\n\n\n\nBoth the worst case and alternative scenario are overly conservative because even a 2-minute release is unlikely to occur since excess flow valves on the system should close immediately upon increased flow resulting from the ruptured transfer line.\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Branch Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Branch Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Branch Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention P"

Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Toledo Facility.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Toledo Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Toledo Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Cumberland County LEPC and Toledo Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Toledo Facility."
