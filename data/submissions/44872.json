      "SummaryText": "Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility, RMP Plan Executive Summary\nThis executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility owned and operated by the City of Westminster.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\nThe City of Westminster believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, the City of Westminster has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP for the chlorine system.  The City of Westminster has prepared this RMP to comply with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard and RMP Program 3 requirements.  By doing so, the City of Westminster affirms its proactive safety and environmental philosophy and acknowledges the inherent value of full RMP compliance.\n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly-implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nThe City of Westminster takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of the facilities it operates by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine at the Big Dry"

The employees that work on the chlorine system are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals.  They are aided in this work by comlete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nThe City of Westminster management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP procedures and policies.\n\nAs for emergency response, the City of Westminster has established and maintained procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and reviewed to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility is located at 13150 N. Huron, Adams County, Colorado.  The Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility uses chlorine to disinfect the water it treats prior to discharge to the Big Dry Creek.  The Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility treats the wastewater for the northern portion of Westminster.  It is an activated sludge plant designated by the State of Colorado as a Class A plant.  The Facility received an award from USEPA for the best plant operating in Region VIII in 1986 and 1992.\n\nThe Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility utilizes chlorine as a biocide in the treatment of water.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of six containers (12,000 pounds) on site.  Therefore, the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility is regulated under the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine stored and used at the facility.\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps ar"

The prevention program includes the following elements:\n\n- Process safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine in the process, process technology, and process equipment.\n\n- Process hazard analysis (PHA), which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of: the hazards of the chlorine process, identification of previous process incidents, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of the engineering and administrative controls, facility siting, human factors, and possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.\n\n- Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions.\n\n- Training for each Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility employee involved in operating the chlorine system.\n\n- Mechanical integrity procedures to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine process equipment.\n\n- Management of change procedures to manage changes (other than \"replacements in kind\") to the chlorine system.\n\n- Pre-startup safety review for additions or significant modifications to the chlorine process, or any new regulated chemical process.\n\n- Compliance audits at least every three years from 1999 to evaluate Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP compliance.\n\n- Incident investigation, to be conducted and documented for each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine from the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility.\n\n- Employee participation in the development and implementation of the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP, and employee access to RMP information.\n\n- Hot work prohibition policy on or near the chlorine system when chlorine is present in the affected section of the process.\n\n- Contractor management program, to ensure appropriate "

      "SummaryText": "evaluation and selection of qualified contractors for work on or near the chlorine system, proper notification of contractors regarding known chlorine system hazards and the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility emergency evacuation plan, limited access to the chlorine process, and evaluation of contractor performance.\n\nIn addition to these elements, the chlorine storage room and chlorine injection room at the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility are equipped with chlorine leak detection devices that continuously monitor the air for chlorine gas.  If the chlorine sensor detects a specified level, audio and visual alarms will be activated.  The alarm system is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation should there be a chlorine release.  Management of Change procedures will be used for the upgrades to the chlorine system.\n\nAccident History\nWithin the five-year period prior to the submittal of this RMP, there were no accidental releases of chlorine meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies, including the Westminster Fire Department.  The program is described in detail in the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility RMP manual and meets the requirements of 40 CFR 68.95, which include facility notification of emergency responders and evacuation.  The goals of the program are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\nThe most substantial change for improved safety is currently underway at the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility.  In September 2005, the City of Westminster embarked on a capital program to fully replace the current chlorination system with an ultrav"

The full UV system is expected to be in place by 2008.\n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Big Dry Creek Water Reclamation Facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nAs part of the development of the Big Dry Creek Reclamation Facility program, and subsequent reviews and updates, process hazard analyses were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.  During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation has been or will be considered for implementation.  Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all will be considered.  The exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered process.\n\nSeveral changes were made to the facility since the original RMP was developed in 1999 to improve safety and to accommodate the new \"Reclaim Plant\".  The changes completed in 2000 included raising the level of the chlorine tanks and adding new scales in the storage room; adding a second tethered air system; hanging valves from the ceiling and adding automatic shut-off systems that activate upon leak detection; adding chlorine lines from the existing facility to the new Reclaim Plant under Big Dry Creek; and adding two new chlorine feeders.  The RMP has been modified to reflect the changes.  All changes were designed with safety in mind and were analyzed in a second PHA conducted at the facility on November 30, 2000."
