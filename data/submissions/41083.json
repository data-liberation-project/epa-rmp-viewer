Individual responsibilities are shown and described in our RMP Organizational Chart and RMP Management Duties.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides activities that we have designed and implemented, including:  1) A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.  2) An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental release prevention programs.  3)  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule.  4)  An overview of our emergency response program.  5)  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public and the environment.  \n2.0  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:  \nThis corporation processes poultry.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in the refrigeration equipment to keep the poultry cool or frozen during processing or storage.  Anhydrous ammonia has been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release.  Our refrigeration system contains in excess of the 10,000 pound threshold quanitity and is required to comply with 40 CFR 68 in addition to 29 CFR 1910.119.  Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.  \n3.0  OFFSITE CONSEQUENCES ANALYSIS SCENARIOS:  \nEPA's RMP rule requires that we conduct off-site conseque"
