This commitment  is  demonstrated  by  our\n\ncomprehensive  accidental release prevention  program  that  covers\n\nareas   such   as   design,  installation,  operating   procedures,\n\nmaintenance and employee training associated with the processes  at\n\nour  facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate  controls\n\nto prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n\n\nOur  facility's  primary activities encompass  the  manufacture  of\n\nsweeteners,  corn syrups, ethanol, and propanediol  utilizing  corn\n\nwet  milling  and  fermentation processes.  Tate  &  Lyle  has one\n\nregulated  substance at our facility.  The substance is Ammonia(anhydrous). \n\nAmmonia (anhydrous) is used as an ingredient in the \n\nfermentation process to produce propanediol.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia at our facility 246,700 pounds.\n\n\n\nTHE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the worst case and alternate release scenarios, Tate  &\n\nLyle  utilized  the  EPA's  RMP Comp. \n\nThe  following paragraphs provide details of  the  chosen\n\nscenarios.\n\n\n\nTHE  AMMONIA  WORST  CASE  RELEASE SCENARIO  submitted  involves  a\n\ncatastrophic  release  from  the Ammonia  storage  tank.   In  this\n\nscenario  246,700 pounds of Ammonia (anhydrous) is  released  in  a\n\ngaseous  form  over 10 minutes.  At class F atmospheric  stability,\n\n1.5 m/s wind speed and urban topography the maximum distance of 5.6\n\nmiles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nTHE AMMONIA ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO involves sending a charge of\n\nAmmonia  to  an empty fermentor when no dextrose is present.   This\n\nscenario  would  release  200 pounds of Ammonia  over  20  minutes.\n\nUnder  neutral weather conditions of class D atmospheric  stability\n\nand  3  m/s  wind speed and "

The methodology used to carry out these  analyses  is\n\nthe  HAZOP and What  if Scenarios.  The studies are undertaken by a\n\nteam  of qualified  personnel  with  expertise in  engineering  and \n\nprocess operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any\n\nfindings related  to  the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\n\nmanner.The  most  recent  PHA  review for the Ammonia System was\n\n05/10/2019.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nTate  &  Lyle,  Loudon  maintains written operating  procedures  to\n\nsafely  conduct  activities within the  covered  processes.   These\n\nprocedures address various modes of operation such as initial start-\n\nup,  normal  operation, temporary operations,  emergency  shutdown,\n\nemergency  operations,  normal  shutdown,  and  startup   after   a\n\nmaintenance shutdown.
