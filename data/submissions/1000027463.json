Facility Identification\n\nThe Peacock Engineering facility is located at 720 Center Street in Carol Stream, Illinois.  Peacock Engineering is a contract food packaging and co-manufacturing facility that provides manufacturing / processing support, secondary packaging and shipping to suppliers and distribution centers. \n\n\n\nThe NAICS code for the facility is 31199.  A large portion of the facility is refrigerated to preserve products for packaging and distribution.   \n\n\n\nThe facility uses ammonia for refrigeration, and is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA RMP Rule. There is one (1) refrigeration system onsite that is used for refrigerating coolers and freezers throughout the facility. \n\n\n\nThe amount of ammonia currently onsite has been estimated at approximately 23,000 pounds.  The refrigeration system is used to cool freezers, coolers, production rooms, and docks.  This refrigeration system uses ammonia refrigerant in a two (2) stage evaporation/condensation cycle.  The ammonia related equipment could be divided into two sections. The \"low stage\" equipment contains (1) -10 Freezer Evaporator, (1) Bologna Freezer Evaporator, (1) Cheese Freezer Evaporator, Low Temperature Pump Package (PR-2), (1) Oil Pot and (1) Booster Compressor.  \n\n\n\nThe \"high stage\" equipment contains (6) Production Room Evaporators, (3) Ultima B Room Evaporators, (3) Ultima A Room Evaporators, (3) Cooler 1 Evaporators, (2) Dock 1 Evaporators, (4) Oswald Room Evaporators, (2) Yellow Room Evaporators, (5) Secondary Packaging Room Evaporators, (2) Viking Room Evaporators, (3) Cooler 2 Evaporators, (2) Dock 2 Evaporators, (8) Cooler 3 Evaporators, (2) Dock 3 Evaporators, (1) Bread Room Evaporator, (2) KWT-3 Room Evaporators, (2) CP-13 Room Evaporators,"

Process Safety Information - Peacock Engineering maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. Process safety information for the ammonia process has been compiled and was last reviewed on August 9, 2011.\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis - Peacock Engineering has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensured a PHA was conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. Peacock Engineering conducted a thorough, initial, PHA study for the refrigeration system during August 2011.\n\n?    Operating Procedures - Peacock Engineering has developed a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.  Peacock Engineering developed initial operating procedures for the refrigeration system during February 2007.  Annually, the operating procedures are reviewed and certified as accurate.\n\n \n\n?    Training - Peacock Engineering has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\n\n?

Mechanical Integrity - Peacock Engineering has developed a site-specific mechanical integrity procedure that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training.  Peacock Engineering formalized maintenance procedures for the refrigeration system during February 2007.\n\n?    Contractor Qualifications - Peacock Engineering has developed a site-specific contractor qualification procedure that ensures all contract employers' safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between Peacock Engineering and the contract employer, and required training and information is communicated, such as the provisions of the emergency response plan and control over entrance into process areas.\n\n?    Incident Investigation - Peacock Engineering has developed a site-specific incident investigation procedure that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated, within 48 hours, by a team of at least one person knowledgeable in the process.  This procedure will also make provisions to ensure a report is prepared at the conclusion of the investigation and findings are promptly addressed. \n\n?

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe Peacock Engineering facility has not experienced an accidental anhydrous ammonia release, which resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage onsite, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nVIII.    Emergency Response Program\n\nPeacock Engineering has developed an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) to ensure that in the event of an emergency the facility personnel are aware of the appropriate actions to take and authorities to contact in order to mitigate the effects of a release. \n\n\n\nPeacock Engineering has conducted emergency drills as a training tool to provide employees proper evacuation procedures and has interacted (i.e. onsite meetings) with the Carol Stream Fire Department. \n\n\n\nPeacock Engineering has coordinated their ERP with the Carol Stream Fire Department.  This coordination effort includes providing the agency with a copy of our ERP, and providing a site diagram and hazardous material information, meeting with Carol Stream Fire Department personnel to discuss the facilities operations/processes, and encouraging periodic on-site inspections and coordination with Carol Stream Fire Department personnel.\n\n\n\nPeacock Engineering's maintenance department will have designated personnel as members of the emergency response team and will be responsible for investigating and assisting the Carol Stream Fire Department (if necessary) with response to accidental releases of ammonia. \n\n\n\nThe facility has four (4) windsocks onsite for use in determining wind direction in the event of an ammonia release and evacuation of the building.

Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for Peacock Engineering.  \n\n\n\nXI.    Management Program\n\nPeacock Engineering has updated a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This system has assigned qualified person(s) (or position) to assist in the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals will be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Currently, Gary Home, Refrigeration Engineer, is the PSM / RMP Coordinator and Brain Gross, Plant Manager, is responsible for implementation of the overall Risk Management Program.\n\n"
