According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public.  The following  mitigation measure is used in this analysis:\n Leak Detection:  Ammonia leak detectors, installed in the vicinity of the recycle tank sound an alarm in the control room if a leak should occur.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSeadrift Operations of the Union Carbide Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible Care  requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The information from the Risk Management Plan has been shared with plant neighbors, LEPC members, elected officials, and other community members through public meetings.  Input on the plan has been received from the Community Advisory Panel and has been incorporated into the plan as well as the public communication sessions.\n\n2.Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nUnion Carbide Seadrift Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces approximately 2.4 billion pounds of plastic, rubber, and other chemical products in its various operating plants.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide and Dow processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Seadrift Site, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and/or flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.\n\n Union Carbide Seadrift  Operations has the following RMP-regulated toxic and flammable substances in quantities above"

Particular attention is given during transfers when the risk of overflow is greatest.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n Maximum Level:  Procedures require that the tank level does not exceed 85% of its capacity.\n Spill Response:  Fire water monitors  are available in the area to reduce emissions.\n\nTitanium Tetrachloride:  This scenario assumes that an unloading hose attached to the storage cylinder ruptures and releases the entire contents (6,200 pounds) to the air.   According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could extend beyond the site fenceline and possibly impact the public.  The following active and passive mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n Hose Size:  The cylinders are unloaded with \u00c2\u00bd\u00c2\u00bf diameter hoses which limits the rate that the  material that can be released.\n Cylinder Size:  The material is delivered in relatively small quantities and only one cylinder is connected at a time.  Therefore the amount of material that can be released is limited.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n Pad Drains:  Concrete around the cylinder is sloped to a containment sump and is able to contain the entire contents of  the cylinder plus rainfall.\n Leak Detectors:  The area contains sensors capable of alarming when a leak is detected.

The area is inspected frequently as routine part of operations.\n\n Alternate Release Scenario --\nPropylene:   This scenario assumes a loss of containment of propylene from the supply trailer in the plant leading  to a vapor cloud explosion.  The total amount of chemical released is 71,700 pounds.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release would not  extend beyond the site fenceline.  The following  mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\nCombustible Gas Detectors:  gas detectors in the area will alarm upon a release and will notify the operator of a problem.  The detectors are also tied into an automatic actuation of the deluge system.\nThe propylene trailer is equiped with excess flow check valves to limit the release in the event of a piping or hose failure.\nFire water monitors are located stragically around the tank to assist in fire fighting and suppress vapor emissions. \nMonitoring and Surveillance: The area is inspected frequently as routine part of operations.\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA)  General Program\nOur general accident prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA RMP rule and OSHA's PSM standard and implementation of the Dow Process Risk Management Standard.    Key elements include:\nEquipment Design:  Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted at least every five years to identify worst case  scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\nLayers of Protection Analysis:  LOPA's are conducted where the identified hazards warrant it.  The layers that are identified are maintained i"

      "SummaryText": "rate and plant-led audits and assessments are conducted to ensure that process operations comply with governmental  and Union Carbide/Dow requirements.\nProcess Risk Management Program: All covered plants have a comprehensive program to ensure that all the elements listed above are implemented.  This Program includes accountabilities for timely and proper implementation of the program elements.\n\n5.\tFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Union Carbide Seadrift Operations that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n Evacuation and shelter-in-place plans and accounting for personnel after an incident\n Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Seadrift Site maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.  The plant squad trains and drills to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning"
