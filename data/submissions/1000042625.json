The Chemical Accident Prevention rule was issued and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule, Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Provisions (Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)), applies to a wide variety of facilities that handle, manufacture, store or use toxic and/or flammable substances.\r\n\r\nThe Global Erie Boulevard Terminal has the capacity to store up to 9.5 million pounds of LPG in stationary storage tanks or railcars at their distribution facility located at 51 Erie Boulevard in Albany, New York, as follows:\r\n\r\n-\tStationary storage tank capacity: Up to 5.9 million pounds\r\n-\tLPG railcars awaiting off-load: Up to 3.6 million pounds (maximum of 24 railcars)\r\n\r\nGlobal is required to address requirements of the CAP regulations because they exceed the 10,000 pound LPG threshold outside of internal fuel and/or retail sales.  The terminal is a wholesale distributor of LPG, and is not subject to the exemptions extended to propane facilities in accordance with the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of 2000.\r\n\r\nGlobal operates the Albany facility owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and provides wholesale LPG distribution to the local home heating, industrial, and commercial markets. The two regulated substances stored and distributed are propane and butane (both referred in this document as LPG). The LPG is brought into the Albany facility by railcar or tank truck, offloaded into one or more of twelve (12) stationary tanks in an earthen mounded tank farm. A maximum of 87% of capacity is stored in these tanks that are connected by manifold fixed piping systems.\r\n\r\nGlobal is also subjec"

Global Erie Blvd. Terminal is a CAP Program 3 facility, and EPA CAP Program 3 requirements fulfill OSHA PSM requirements. \r\n   \r\nThe Risk Management Plan contains the Policies and Procedures used at Global to assure continued compliance with the EPA CAP and OSHA PSM regulations and is considered an integrated management system.  Most of the documents that are part of the Risk Management Plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose, organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general step-by-step instructions.\r\n  \r\nMost procedures contain information on document control and filing.  Typically, documents are periodically revised through the procedures outlined in Section 9 - Management of Change.\r\n  \r\nEmployees are required to review relevant elements of the Risk Management Plan's policies and procedures.  The manual is available on-site for employee review.  Recommendations to improve this document's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to the Terminal Manager.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Risk Management Plan is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. \r\n\r\nThe phrase Risk Management Plan refers to the site management plan as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.

Internal audits are required, by regulation, at least every 3 years.  Compliance audits are conducted by competent personnel with knowledge of the regulatory requirements subject to evaluation and rudimentary knowledge of the process.\r\n\r\nA documented internal audit report is generated following the audit.  Any recommendations from the audit are tracked by the Terminal Manager until completed.  The audit report is maintained on file (at least two prior reports) as well as documented evidence of corrective action.  Since this facility was a new facility as of April 29, 2013, the first compliance audit will be required by April 29, 2016.\r\n\r\n1.1.11 Incident Investigation\r\nA thorough investigation of any incident that could or resulted in an emergency release of highly hazardous chemicals must take place within 48 hours of the incident.  This investigation must identify the chain of events and causes of the incident and include corrective measures that can be developed and implemented.  Global has an incident investigation program as part of the RMP.  The Terminal Manager is responsible for reviewing and approving investigation reports.  The Terminal Manager is also responsible for tracking recommendations from the incident reports to completion.\r\n\r\nIncident investigation reports are retained for the life of the process and are reviewed as part of the 5-year system-wide process hazard analysis.\r\n\r\n1.1.12 Employee Participation\r\nThis Section outlines how employees participate in the development of the facility's Risk Management Plan.
