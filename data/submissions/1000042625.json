The Chemical Accident Prevention rule was issued and is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This rule, \"Chemical Accident Prevention (CAP) Provisions\" (Part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)), applies to a wide variety of facilities that handle, manufacture, store or use toxic and/or flammable substances.\n\n\n\nThe Global Erie Boulevard Terminal has the capacity to store up to 9.5 million pounds of LPG in stationary storage tanks or railcars at their distribution facility located at 51 Erie Boulevard in Albany, New York, as follows:\n\n\n\n-    Stationary storage tank capacity: Up to 5.9 million pounds\n\n-    LPG railcars awaiting off-load: Up to 3.6 million pounds (maximum of 24 railcars)\n\n\n\nGlobal is required to address requirements of the CAP regulations because they exceed the 10,000 pound LPG threshold outside of internal fuel and/or retail sales.  The terminal is a wholesale distributor of LPG, and is not subject to the exemptions extended to propane facilities in accordance with the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of 2000.\n\n\n\nGlobal operates the Albany facility owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and provides wholesale LPG distribution to the local home heating, industrial, and commercial markets. The two regulated substances stored and distributed are propane and butane (both referred in this document as LPG). The LPG is brought into the Albany facility by railcar or tank truck, offloaded into one or more of twelve (12) stationary tanks in an earthen mounded tank farm. A maximum of 87% of capacity is stored in these tanks that are connected by manifold fixed piping systems.\n\n\n\nGlobal is also subjec"

Most of the documents that are part of the Risk Management Plan follow a standard format that includes the purpose, organization, responsibilities and authorities, as well as general step-by-step instructions.\n\n  \n\nMost procedures contain information on document control and filing.  Typically, documents are periodically revised through the procedures outlined in Section 9 - Management of Change.\n\n  \n\nEmployees are required to review relevant elements of the Risk Management Plan's policies and procedures.  The manual is available on-site for employee review.  Recommendations to improve this document's accuracy or effectiveness in assuring employee, visitor and contractor safety can be directed to the Terminal Manager.\n\n\n\nThe goal of the Risk Management Plan is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment. \n\n\n\nThe phrase \"Risk Management Plan\" refers to the site management plan as well as the registration information submitted to EPA.  In general, the EPA CAP regulations require covered facilities to develop and implement a Risk Management Plan and maintain documentation required by the plan"

Covered facilities are also required to re-submit their Risk Management Plans every five years.  The RMP Submit provides an electronic summary of the facility's Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nCovered facilities also must continue to implement the management practices documented in this plan and update their plans periodically or when processes change, as required by the rule.\n\n\n\n1.1.1    Management System\n\nThe implementation and management responsibilities for the Plan must be clearly defined.
