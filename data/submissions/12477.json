We currently employ 120 people and own 19 acres of land at this location.  The facility was originally established in 1915 as a manufacturer of sodium silicate.  Since then, we have grown to include four more manufacturing units producing sodium silicate based products.     \n\nOur products are used by other manufacturers in their operations and include the following: \n7 Sodium Silicate - Used by the textile, mining, and papermaking industries.  \n7 Zeolite - Used as an ingredient which replaces phosphates in powder laundry detergents.\n7 Silica Gel Catalysts - Used in the manufacture of plastics such as milk jugs and grocery bags.\n7 Molecular Sieves - Used as a moisture absorbent in insulated windows.\n7 Zeolite Catalysts - Used by the petroleum refining industry for the production of cleaner burning gasoline and in automotive catalytic converters.\n    \nWe Prevent Accidents By\nDESIGNING for Safety\n7 Redundant safety systems and instrumentation\n7 Automatic and manual shut-off valves\n7 Safety reviews performed prior to start-up\n7 Air and water monitoring systems\nMAINTAINING our Plant\n7 Regular equipment checks\n7 Preventative maintenance program\n7 Regular inspections of critical safety equipment\n7 Highly skilled and trained employees\nOPE"

Chemical emergencies often occur quickly.  For the first few minutes you may be on your own and you will need to rely on your senses and best judgement.  If you are notified of a release or smell a strong chemical odor, go indoors and close all windows, doors, and vents to the outside.  This \"Shelter in Place\" technique is further described in information available from Wyandotte County. For further instructions during an emergency situation:\n7 Listen to your local radio or TV station\n7 Await instructions from authorities"
