The vessels are listed as Flammable liquid storage areas Slots 1-5, LPG storage areas slots 6-9.  Listed materials stored in these areas are used as feedstocks for pilot plant operations.  Feedstocks are feed to the process at variable rates ranging from ~1 lb/hr to 100 lbs/hr.  There are no scrubbers on site.  Process emissions are controlled by PSV's, rupture disks, flare and distillation columns.  All processes with the exception of six pressure storage tanks are vented to the flare.

All of these steps should be documented.\n\n\n\nChemical Research & Licensing shall:\n\n* Identify major HSE hazards and potentially adverse effects and assess the related risks which could arise from the Company's existing, or proposed new, activities (including acquisitions, divestment, abandonment or merger) and which could potentially impact:\n\n* Health and safety of employees, contractors and the public.\n\n* The environment including soil and groundwater contamination.\n\n* The company's reputation, liability or profitability.\n\n* Asset damage.\n\n* Use risk assessment methodologies, including scenarios and consequence/probability ratings (Risk Assessment Matrix), which are appropriate for the hazard, effect and associated risk being considered.\n\n* Apply as a function of the risk level, appropriate controls to prevent, or reduce likelihood of, occurrence and applies appropriate recovery measures to reduce the possible effects of the HSE risks.\n\n* Assure that measures for risk control and recovery are adequate and clearly linked with related tasks/activities (competence/responsibility) that are assigned to specific individuals in the organization.\n\n* Manage changes to facilities, processes, operations and other activities to assure that hazards, effects and risks are reassessed and that plans for HSE ev"

All alarms are audible and are either automatically activated or can be manually activated.  To manually activate the alarms you must depress the red \"Alarm Activation\" button for two seconds on the fire alarm panel.  An \"all clear\" announcement will be made once any danger has passed.\n\n\n\nThe first priority following any incident must be the health and safety of all persons involved. The response will depend on the incident and the resources readily available, and may include the administration of first aid, fire suppression, evacuation, shutting off equipment and/or notifying the ambulance police or fire departments.  Once the situation is secured, additional assistance may be sought as required and notification procedures must be initiated.\n\n\n\nAs part of the RMP management process, continual training is provided to company employees directly affected by the RMP rule.  The installation of permanent hard piping will be done in 2002 negating the use of flexible process lines currently in use with some RMP chemicals.  Best management and industrial practices will continue to drive safety for handling all chemicals at CR&L.\n\n"
