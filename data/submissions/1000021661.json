Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nSeadrift Coke, L.P. is located on Texas Highway 185 South, 0.5 mile south of the intersection of Texas State Highway 185 and Highway 35, Port Lavaca, Texas 77979. Our facility consists of one delayed coker and a rotary kiln. The primary product is calcined petroleum needle coke produced from decant oil feedstock. Byproducts from the coking process are gas oil, naphtha, light coker naphtha and fuel gas. Naphtha, light coker naphtha and fuel gas are regulated flammable substances. The other regulated substance is chlorine, which is used for water treatment.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS:\n\nDescription of Hazard Analysis and offsite consequence on file. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS:\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accidental prevention program in place at Seadrift Coke, LP. Since all the processes subject to the EPA RMP regulation are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEMPLOYEES PARTICIPATION:\nIt is the policy of Seadrift Coke, LP to encourage and provide opportunities for all employees to participate in the design, implementation of our Operational Manangement System (OMS) effort.
