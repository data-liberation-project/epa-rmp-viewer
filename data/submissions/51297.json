The purpose of this Risk Management Program is to prepare for emergencies relating to the delivery, use and storage of anhydrous ammonia. \n\nThe Bethlehem Plant stores and uses anhydrous ammonia in Selective Catalytic Reduction processes above the regulatory threshold amount (10,000 lbs) requiring the development of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules (Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations part 68). This document is used in conjunction with the Conectiv Process Safety Management (PSM) program. The purpose of this RMP is to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Conectiv. \n\nBuilt on approximately 56 acres in Northampton County, Pennsylvania the Conectiv Bethlehem Plant utilizes anhydrous ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, in its Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process. SCR is a means of converting nitrogen oxides, also referred to as NOx, with the aid of a catalyst into diatomic nitrogen (N2) and water. A gaseous reductant, anhydrous ammonia, is added to a stream of flue or exhaust gases and is absorbed into a catalyst. At the Conectiv facility the anhydrous ammonia is received via tank truck delivery and is transferred into one of the two storage vessels on the southeast side of each power block. The facility has two 12,000 gallon storage tanks for anhydrous ammonia.  Engineering and administrative controls allow the tanks to be filled up to 85% of capacity.  The total amount of anhydrous ammonia on-site at any given time will not exceed 24,000 gallons.\n\nConectiv Bethlehem employees are trained to respond to releases of anhydrous ammonia of less than 300 ppm as measured by area monitors.  All release responses above 300 ppm will be conducted by local emergenc"

Conectiv will work closely with the local fire department and with the Northampton County local emergency planning committee (LEPC) to ensure injuries and/or environmental damage will be minimized if a release should occur. The facility employees have been trained on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintenance procedures to provide continued safe operation of the system.\n\nTo prevent an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, the Conectiv Bethlehem Plant uses ongoing employee/contractor training, standard operating procedures, pre-startup safety reviews, management of change procedures, hot work permitting, emergency response drills and auditing programs as main components of its release prevention program.  The facility also has a preventative maintenance program; a pipe and valve labeling program; and an inspection program applicable to the regulated process. \n\nThere have been no known accidental anhydrous ammonia releases from the system resulting in either an on-site or off-site consequence at the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania site.  \n\nThe Risk Management Program at Conectiv consists of three elements:\n\n1.A hazard assessment to understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the previous five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\n2.A prevention program to maintain and safely operate the process containing more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes) ? see topic 4.\n3.An emergency response system to respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes ? see topic 6.\n\nConectiv also has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing various levels of safeguards against the accidental release of hazardous substances, injuries and property damage.

When a hazardous substance is used, Conectiv considers the potential for the substance to adversely affect Conectiv employees and contractors, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.  Equipment is designed, built, operated, and maintained to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release.  Government and industry standards are adhered to in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the equipment.\n\nThe safety program at Conectiv consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP rule.   The RMP rule requires the following elements:\n\n1.Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies.\n\nConectiv implements controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. The controls include standard operating procedures, administrative procedures, emergency response plans, inspection programs, detection systems, hazard evaluation programs, training programs, programs to ensure safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of processes within Conectiv.\n\n\n2. Conectiv Bethlehem and Regulated Substances. \n\nThe Conectiv Bethlehem Power Plant is a power generation facility designed to supply power during peak demand periods. In order to support these operations, Conectiv handles a regulated substance (anhydrous ammonia) in a sufficient quantity covered by the RMP rule, as shown below:\n\n                                                                                                  Maximum             Largest\n                                Program       Regulated                               On-site                 Single\nProcess                      Level          Substance                            Quantity                Vessel \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia    3           Anhydrous Ammonia               24,000 gals          12,000 gals\n           "

Each block has its own anhydrous ammonia system to control NOx emissions from the combustion turbines.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nThe Conectiv Bethlehem Plant focuses on ways to prevent an accidental release of a hazardous substance. The following sub-sections briefly describe the elements of Conectiv's prevention program for utilizing anhydrous ammonia;\n\n   3.1  Process Safety Information: Conectiv maintains a variety of technical documents used to provide safe operation of the covered process. The documents address (1) physical properties of hazardous substances utilized in the process, (2) operating parameters of the equipment/process to include Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and (3) design basis configuration of process equipment.\n\n   3.2  Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances on the premises, including anhydrous ammonia. MSDSs are used to (1) provide health and safety information to employees, contractors and emergency responders; (2) train employees; and (3) perform Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs). MSDSs are used to provide instructions for proper handling of hazardous chemicals at the plant. \n\n   3.3  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): The Conectiv Bethlehem Plant performs and periodically updates PHAs for the covered process to identify potential process hazards and generate recommendations to improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering, environmental, process operating experience, maintenance, safety and a leader with process hazard analysis experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.

Chemical Specific Prevention Steps \n                                                                                                                                                                                          In addition to the required prevention program elements, Conectiv has implemented safety features specific to anhydrous ammonia. Conectiv compared anhydrous and aqueous ammonia and determined anhydrous ammonia was more appropriate for minimizing the potential of serious incident or off-site impact due to the following:\n* Decrease in the number of deliveries to the site; therefore less truck traffic,\n* Decrease in the number of delivery truck hook-ups and disconnects which is when the majority of all ammonia releases occur.\n* Decrease in the number of failure points (i.e., valves, pumps, flanges, etc.) and\n* Decrease in the likelihood of corrosion to the operating system due to the nature of anhydrous ammonia\n  \nThe covered process is located almost entirely within the containment area, which further reduces the hazard. The storage tanks are engineered specifically for the anhydrous ammonia system. The underground piping is: (1) double-contained, (2) wrapped with corrosion protection tape, (3) cathodically protected and (4) the interstitial space is charged with nitrogen and monitored.  The process uses a control system with emergency shutdowns to ensure safe operation. Detectors and alarms located around each tank, injection skids and Heat Recovery System Generators (HRSG) provide continuous monitoring for ammonia in the event of a release, providing early detection and aid in quick response if a release incident was to occur.\n                                                                                                                                        "

Five-Year Accident History  \n\nConectiv Bethlehem is required to complete a review of the covered process for incidents occurring in the five-year period prior to the submittal date for the regulation. Since the system's inception there have been no incidents involving the regulated processes resulting in the release of anhydrous ammonia causing on-site or off-site impacts. \n\n6.

Conectiv does not have \"First Responder\" capabilities. Conectiv's response will be to notify the City of Bethlehem, the Northampton County LEPC and other off-site emergency response personnel in the event of a potential for serious incident or off-site impact. The Conectiv Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for:\n* Informing the LEPC about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences,\n* Clear identification and communication, roles and responsibilities during an emergency event, and\n* Reviewing and updating the Emergency Response Plan  \n\nAll Conectiv personnel are trained in 'shelter-in-place' procedures and evacuation procedures. Conectiv periodically coordinates emergency response drills. The written Emergency Response Plan complies with other federal contingency plan regulations (i.e., OPA-90 Regulations, OSHA Regulations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and 29 CFR 1910.120(a), State EPCRA Rules and Laws) and has been communicated to local emergency response officials and local fire departments.
