(TRANSFLO) has prepared the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for operations at their Charlotte, North Caroline facility.  The TRANSFLO terminal provides transloading services between rail and truck transportation modes.  TRANSFLO has been in operation at this facility for over 20 years and the facility is located at 601 North Hoskins Road in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as other health, safety and environmental regulations and standards.  \n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTRANSFLO transloads vinyl acetate from railroad tank cars to highway cargo tanks in quantities which exceed the 15,000 pound threshold quantity given in 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.\n\nAccidental Release Scenarios\n\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of vinyl acetate, TRANSFLO has implemented several precautionary measures.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of vinyl acetate are process equipment (vents, relief valves, check valves and manual shutoffs).\n\nTRASNFLO has developed standard operating procedures (SOP?s), which incorporate safety measures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the vinyl acetate rail to truck transfer operation.  TRANSFLO encourages employee participation in the development of the control measures used at the facility. Employees have the opportunity to voice opinions, questions, or ideas to improve the operational safety.  Conversely, TRANSFLO employees may approach their supervisor directly to make suggestions for topics that require immediate attention or improvement.\n\nTRANS"

      "SummaryText": "FLO understands that maintaining the vinyl acetate transfer unit in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases.  The preventative maintenance program is schedule, documented and managed to ensure that regular maintenance occurs on the system.  \n\nThe local fire department does not conduct formal audits, however TRANSFLO occasionally invites the fire department to tour the facility and conduct an annual emergency response drill.  In addition, the following agencies audit the TRANSFLO facility on a regular basis:\n\n?    North Caroline Department of Agriculture\n?    Federal Railroad Administration\n?    Department of Labor\n?    Mecklenburg County Air Quality Agency\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nOver the past five (5) years, TRANSFLO has nit experienced an accidental offsite release of vinyl acetate.\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nTRANSFLO has documented emergency response procedures in order to coordinate response efforts in the event of an offsite release.  Included in the emergency action plan (EAP) are measures to be implemented internally by TRANSFLO personnel and notification procedures for local emergency response agencies.\n\nTRANSFLO has trained on-site personnel to respond to accidental vinyl acetate releases and other emergencies.  These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA?s Hazardous operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  Three of these personnel are trained to the level of Incident Commander.  They will receive annual updated training.\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with TRANSFLO emergency response procedures, copes of the emergency action plans have been submitted for review by the local agencies. Mecklenburg County Local emergency Planning Committee (LECP) has reviewed TRANSFLO?s emergency response procedures.  In the event of a vinyl acetate release resulting in offsite consequences, the general public will be notified by the LEPC."
