We are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner, as demonstrated by the resources we invest to prevent accidents.  As a member of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, we adhere to the principles of Responsible Care?.  In addition to ensuring that our employees have the best possible training in the operation of our processes, we demand that safety be the first priority in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our process equipment is designed, constructed and maintained using sound engineering practices and conforms to  applicable industry codes and standards including those of the Chlorine Institute for equipment used in manufacturing and handling of chlorine.  \nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  We have implemented maintenance and inspection programs to ensure site integrity.  Examples of some such controls include 1) installation of pressure safety valves to prevent rupture of vessels due to overpressurization, 2) routine visual inspection and thickness checks to ensure vessels and piping are in good condition, 3) limiting inventory in chlorine storage tanks, 4) monitoring vessel and piping pressures.\nHowever, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  Mitigation measures that have been included in our design include installation of isolation valves, excess flow valves which limit the amount of chemical released, a  fully implemented emergency response plan, appropriate personnel protective equipment, and an alarm system for early notification of a release.  Should a release occur, we use a dispersion model - Systematic Approach Fo"

This information is communicated to 911 in case any actions need to be taken by emergency response agencies.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant is primarily involved in manufacturing chlorine and other inorganic chemicals. As a part of these manufacturing processes, we produce chlorine and use sulfur dioxide as a feedstock.  They are  substances that are covered by the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68). \n\n  Vulcan products serve a multitude of vital needs throughout the United Sates and global economies.  Chlorine is sold as a product and is also used as a feedstock in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid.  Common uses of chlorine include  treatment of municipal water supplies, sewage and wastewater. Chlorine is also used to make bleach.  Sulfur dioxide is used as a feedstock in making sodium hydrosulfite.  Our customers use sodium hydrosulfite in the paper industry to bleach paper.  We use a combination of good design practices,  release prevention programs, and an emergency response program to ensure the safety of our employees, the public, and the environment.  We are committed to operating our facility in a safe and responsible manner.  \n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA?s RMP rule (40 CFR 68) requires that we provide information about two types of off site consequence analysis scenarios:  worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios.  There are strict requirements for choosing and modeling worst-case release scenarios; as a result, these scenarios are often exceedingly conservative.  The purpose of the alternative release scenarios is to provide emergency planners with more information about the chemicals we handle and about their relative hazards.  The alterna"

      "SummaryText": "tive release scenarios are more realistic than worst-case release scenarios but are still unlikely to happen.\nFollowing are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit exposure distances.\n\nWorst-case toxic release scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario representing the toxic substances handled by Vulcan is a catastrophic rupture of a storage tank containing chlorine.   In this scenario, the entire contents of a full  chlorine tank, is released to the atmosphere over a 10-min period.  Although we have several safety and mitigation features on these storage tanks that would limit the release rate and/or quantity of the release, none of these measures is taken into account in evaluating this scenario.    \n\nAlternative toxic release scenarios\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine is a break in the pipe used for loading chlorine from the process into a rail car.  The chlorine in the pipe and additional flow over five minutes is released to the atmosphere.  Five minutes is the length of time required for a Vulcan employee to stop the release.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for sulfur dioxide is a break in the pipe used for unloading sulfur dioxide from the rail car into our process.  The flow rate to the atmosphere is limited by the rail car excess flow valve.  The release lasts for 5 min, which is the length of time required for a Vulcan employee to stop the release.  \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  We are in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and this RMP rule.  Our management system addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program, as described below:\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant maintains a variety of technical documents that describe"

These recommendations are reviewed by management and are tracked until they are implemented.\nWe update and revalidate each process hazard analysis every five years.  The results and findings from these revalidation studies are documented and retained, and recommendations are tracked until resolved by management.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nOur engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures that ensure the safe operation of our facility.  These procedures cover all modes of operation, such as (1) unit start up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial start up of a new or improved process. Operating procedures are used as a reference by experienced employees and provide a consistent basis for training new employees.  In addition to describing the steps for safely conducting operations, the procedures also contain valuable information about safe upper and lower limits, consequences of deviations, and applicable safety and health information.  Operating procedures are annually certified as accurate to ensure that they are updated following process changes. \n\nTRAINING\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant trains workers to safely and effectively perform their tasks.

Both classroom and on the job training is provided.  In addition to training in specific job functions, training is also provided on safe work practices.  The frequency of refresher training is decided, in part, by our employees but is performed at least every three years.  All training given to an employee is documented, along with the means used to verify that the training is understood.\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant maintains the mechanical integrity of our equipment to prevent equipment failures that could endanger workers, the public, or the environment.  Our inspection and testing program helps identify equipment damage or deterioration before the equipment fails.  Predictive maintenance technologies employed include vibration analysis, thermography and ultrasonic analysis.  Vibration analysis is used for early detection of bearing problems on pumps and motors.  Thermography is used to locate problems on electrical equipment and ultrasonic technology is used to determine the thickness of tank walls and piping.  When a deficiency is found, maintenance personnel will correct the problem and try to identify the root causes of the deficiency so that future problems are avoided.  Our quality assurance system ensures that new or replacement equipment meets the strict design standards required for service in our facility.  The mechanical integrity system includes (1) inspection and testing procedures, (2) replacement equipment specifications, (3) procedures for safe work practices, (4) maintenance personnel training, and (5) required documentation.\n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\nWe review"

The management of change system applies to changes in the chemicals used, process equipment, technology, procedures, and other facility changes.\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\nWhenever a change occurs that requires updating the process safety information, the Vulcan-Port Edwards plant performs a pre-startup safety review.  This review ensures that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are prepared for service before the process is restarted. A pre-startup review will generally include field verification of new construction and also serves a quality assurance function by verifying that accident prevention measures are implemented correctly.  Generally, a pre-startup review will ensure that (1) construction and equipment are consistent with design standards, (2) adequate operating, safety, and maintenance procedures are in place, (3) training for all affected employees is complete, (4) a process hazard analysis has been performed and (5) process hazard analysis recommendations have been addressed and (6) actions required for start up have been completed.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION\n\nThe Vulcan-Port Edwards plant trains its employees to promptly investigate each incident that resulted in, or could have resulted in, injuries to employees, the public, or impact the environment.

Audits are performed by a team that is knowledgeable in our processes, but is independent of our facility, to ensure a thorough and complete evaluation.  The audit team systematically evaluates each aspect of the prevention program, ensuring both compliance with the RMP rule and effective hazard prevention.  The results of audits are documented, and recommendations are tracked until they are resolved.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe prevention program described previously ensures the safe operation of our facility by providing our employees with a system they can use to safely perform their job functions.  This management system helps prevent hazards associated with equipment failures and human error. In addition to the prevention program, the Vulcan-Port Edwards plant has safety features built into the design of our facility that help to ensure safe process operation for our employees, the public, and the environment.  These features may contain or control a release, detect a release, or reduce the consequences of a release.
