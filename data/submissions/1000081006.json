(a wholly-owned subsidiary of Equalizer, Inc.) owns and operates a fertilizer terminal facility near Hastings, Nebraska which is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Program rule under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  \n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program rule requires a facility which handles threshold amounts of certain chemical substances to develop a program (if one is not already in existence) to prevent accidental releases of these substances and to minimize the consequences of those releases that do occur.  This Risk Management Program is to include a management system, a hazard assessment to identify the possible offsite impacts of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, a five-year accident history record, an accidental release prevention program, an emergency response program and a Risk Management Plan which summarizes the entire program and is submitted to the EPA.\n\n\n\nThe following is the Executive Summary of the Risk Management Plan for this Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility located near Hastings in South Central Nebraska, serves as a storage and distribution terminal for fertilizer products.  \n\n\n\nThe Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility serves as a vital link in the fertilizer distribution system by receiving products from manufacturing plants, by storing the products until they are needed and by distributing the products primarily in the Midwest region.  Being centrally located, the facility provides a convenient location for fertilizer retailers to get their product.  Additionally, Equalizer Midwest, Inc. is committed to being a solid, reliable member of the Hastings community.  \n\n\n\nEqualizer Midwest, Inc. has 14 full-time employees, with a total of more than 100 years of combined operating experience.

The anhydrous ammonia is primarily received by truck and shipped by truck and is stored as a refrigerated liquid at ambient pressure as well as a gas liquified by pressure.  A refrigeration system is utilized in support of the storage of the liquid at ambient pressure and various vessels and piping serve in the transfer of ammonia within the process.  The anhydrous ammonia distributed from this facility is used almost exclusively as an agricultural fertilizer.  Equalizer Midwest, Inc. does manufacture some liquid fertilizer using a stationary T-Reactor on site.  Anhydrous Ammonia is the only regulated substance in this process.\n\n\n\nThe facility was originally designed and constructed to be an anhydrous ammonia manufacturing plant and was operated as such from startup in 1962 until 1985, at which time the manufacturing process was discontinued.  Since 1985, the facility has functioned strictly as a storage and distribution terminal for anhydrous ammonia, utilizing the storage and transfer infrastructure of the original manufacturing plant.  Also, since 1985, changes including additions and improvements have resulted in the current design and operation of the terminal.  Farmland Industries, Inc. owned and operated the facility from 1962 until 2003.  In June of 2003, the facility was purchased by Equalizer, Inc. of Waco, Texas, which subsequently established the ownership and operation of the facility under Equalizer Midwest, Inc.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response \n\n\n\nIt is the policy of Equalizer Midwest, Inc. to eliminate significant accidental releases of any substance and, particularly, of any hazardous or regulated substance and to minimize and eliminate to th"

Prevention of accidental releases is critical to the safe operation of the facility, to the safety of its employees and to the safety of the general public.  Consequently, the management and employees of the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases from this facility.\n\n\n\nThe Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility has a written Emergency Action Plan - as required by the RMProgram and other EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules - and is committed to implement the plan in response to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The action plan is coordinated with the Adams County Local Emergency Planning Committee and the local emergency response agencies.   Personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding activities at the facility and emergency response issues.  Equalizer Midwest is a non-responding facility, however, employees are trained to respond and deal with minor releases.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\n\n\nAs a handler of anhydrous ammonia in refrigerated storage, the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29CFR 1910.119, in addition to the RMProgram rule.  Under the RMProgram rule, the handling of ammonia at the facility is characterized as a Program 3 process, requiring a Program 3 Prevention Program.  For a facility with a Program 3 process, the Prevention Program required under the RMProgram rule is nearly identical to that required by the OSHA PSM standard.\n\n\n\nThe OSHA Process Safety Management/EPA RMP Prevention Program consists of a set of management policies and procedures which promotes and recognizes process safety and the prevention of accidents in facilities that handle, use, store and process hazardous substances.

We have not had any accidental releases of a regulated substance at this facility in the last five years.  There have been no injuries or off-site consequences dealing with the regulated substance in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nSafety improvements occur as part of an ongoing evaluation process at the Equalizer Midwest, Inc. terminal and are facilitated by the Process Safety Management/Prevention Program.  In a formal procedure, at least every five years, the process hazard analysis is updated/revalidated, but review is also ongoing through management of change procedures, operator training, incident investigation and mechanical integrity programs.
