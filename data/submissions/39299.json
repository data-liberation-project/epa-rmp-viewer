      "SummaryText": "Facility: Farmers Cooperative Company, Paullina, Iowa 51046\nContact: Larry Davis\nPhone: 712/448-3412\n\n1. Facility Policy\n\n   The owners, management and employees of the Farmers Cooperative Company (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anyhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire deprtment, or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information:\n\n   The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizer for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application. The maximum amount stored would be 127,500 pounds.\n\n3. Worse-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario:\n\n   a. The worse-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 127,500 pounds which is the largest storage tank at 85 percent of capacity as limited by design standard. The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million or ppm) is 4.40 miles.\n\n   B. The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a 3-inch transfer hose followed by a release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off intervenes and stops the flow of ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 26,638 pound. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .70 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n   The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910."

The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by the Iowa Administrative Code Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule43.6(200)-Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\n   There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage."
