      "SummaryText": "PROCESS SUMMARY\nThe Reddy Ice #341 facility located in Davie, Florida, manufactures ice for wholesale/retail distribution. The facility maintains approximately 15,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant for ice manufacturing and storage. \n\nThe refrigeration system design is a direct ammonia process.  The system has numerous protective controls including motor overload, high discharge temperature, high discharge pressure, low suction pressure, low oil differential on all compressors, level control switches on all applicable vessels and approved pressure safety relief valves on all applicable equipment that discharge into a common header, which vents into a 3,000 gallon deluge tank located outside the facility.\n\nThe system consists of three thermosyphon-cooled rotary screw compressor packages, one water-cooled rotary screw compressor package, five water-cooled reciprocating compressor packages, one induced draft evaporative condensers, two forced draft condensers, one thermosyphon receiver vessel, one controlled-pressure receiver vessel, six 50-ton flooded tube ice machines, one low temperature liquid ammonia pump recirculator package, five suction accumulator vessels, three liquid transfer drum vessels, twelve air-cooling axial fan evaporators and a plate heat exchanger water chiller system.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia, when properly used, has proven to be a safe and reliable refrigerant. The sharp odor of ammonia provides its own warning agent. Practically all accidents involving anhydrous ammonia can be avoided through the facility\u00c2\u00bfs program of proper training; knowledge of the equipment and procedures; and conducting preventive maintenance on all ammonia equipment. Reddy Ice has instituted administrative and engineering controls as well as training programs on the corporate level to prevent such accidents.\n\nAn outside supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to replenish the ammonia in the system as required.\n\nThe Reddy Ice-Davie facility is committed to operating a"

The facility has multiple safeguards pertinent to the ammonia process.  These include continuous exhaust purge fans in the engine room, controls which shut down the compressors if operating limits are violated, and the capability of shutting down the entire system remotely if required.  Administrative controls are in place that limits the storage vessels to their intended capacities and operating levels.\n\nThe company has developed an emergency action plan that includes procedures for notification of emergency authorities/agencies and the public, evacuation of personnel, and first responder duties by trained refrigeration personnel.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM 3\nBased on the Reddy Ice-Davie facility's ammonia inventory, location, and requirement to meet OSHA PSM standards, it has been determined the facility is subject to the Prevention Program 3 requirements. This accident prevention program is a way to make safe operations and accident prevention systematic throughout the facility. Reddy Ice Group corporate management and Reddy Ice-Davie management are committed to operating a safe and compliant facility for the protection of its employees, the public, and the environment. A Combined Process Safety Management/Risk Management (PSM/RM) Program has been developed to meet the accidental release prevention requirements of both EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR Part 68) and OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) under the Clean Air Act. The Combined PSM/RM Program contains thirteen elements, establishing requirements for employee participation, safety information, hazard analysis, pre-startup safety review, standard operating procedures, employee training, management of change, mechanical integrity/preventive maintenance, hot work permits, contractor qualifications, release incident investigation, compliance audit"

These elements are tied together by a management system to ensure plant-wide development, implementation and integration of all the Program requirements.\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEM\nA management system has been developed to oversee the implementation of the PSM/RM Program elements. The plant manager has been identified as PSM/RM Program Coordinator, with overall responsibility for developing, implementing and integrating the Program requirements. Under the PSM/RM Program, various responsibilities have been assigned to other individuals. The plant engineer is responsible for portions of the program closely tied to the refrigeration equipment and operation. An established safety committee meets each month to present a safety meeting and address any safety issues brought up by employees during the month.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nAs required by the Risk Management Program regulations, the Reddy Ice-Davie facility has conducted a hazard assessment including offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) for potential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. The OCAs describe the potential offsite exposure to surrounding areas from an accidental release. A worst-case release scenario and alternative release scenarios were developed and calculated using the EPA RMP*Comp modeling program, and the potentially affected offsite population and facilities were identified.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe Reddy Ice-Davie facility has not had any releases that would require reporting as part of a five-year accident history.\n\nEMERGENCY PLANNING AND RESPONSE\nThe Reddy Ice-Davie facility operates under an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that includes procedures for: notifying plant personnel, the public, and local emergency responders; emergency evacuation/response procedures; use of emergency alarms and equipment; employee training in evacuation procedures; first aid for ammonia exposure; and periodic review and updating of the EAP. The plan is reviewed regularly for verification of data, a"

The ammonia inventory is verified and reported annually to the state and local authorities, and the plant is incorporated into the community emergency response plan developed under 42 USC.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES\nThe Reddy Ice-Davie facility operates an ongoing program of facility preventive and predictive maintenance to identify and implement changes that may result in improved safety and operations. Current planned changes are limited to continued implementation of the line and valve labeling program and ongoing revision of program documentation."
