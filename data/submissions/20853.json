      "SummaryText": "REGULATED SUBSTANCE AND STATIONARY SOURCE\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to provide cold storage at Sysco Food Services of Kansas City. Anhydrous ammonia is listed in 40CFR 68.130 as a regulated toxic substance.   Accidental release of ammonia to the atmosphere may reach public receptors surrounding the facility.  Anhydrous Ammonia is lighter than air, a colorless gas, and impacts public health when inhaled above the toxic end point as defined within 40 CFR 68.22. \n\nThe refrigeration system consists of 2-stage compression (four compressors),  three condensers, receiver, two accumulators (15?F and -25?F) and four ammonia pumps. Liquid refrigerant is pumped from the two accumulators to various evaporators for cooling and freezing food storage areas. Ammonia refrigerant is vaporized in the evaporators and returns to each stage of compression where it combines with accumulator flash vapor and compressed to condenser pressure.  After condensing and flowing into the receiver, the liquid is cooled by pressure expansion into the two lower pressure accumulators.\n\nMaximum system inventory is 11,600 pounds of ammonia, which exceeds EPA's threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. We estimate that this was exceeded in August 1999.\n \nOFFSITE HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nIn case of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, EPA requires that the facility provide an offsite hazard assessment and consequence analysis.  The assessment includes analyzing two release scenarios (Worse Case and Alternate Case) to determine the toxic end point.  \n\nThe toxic end point is based on ERPG-2 concentrations developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  The ERPG-2 is a maximum air borne concentration in which is believed that almost all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious irreversible health effects or other symptoms that could impair an individuals ability to take protective action.  AIHA has identified the ERPG-2 end point of anhydrous a"

      "SummaryText": "mmonia as .14mg/l (200 ppm).\n\nWorse Case scenario is releasing the entire contents of the receiver in ten minutes due to a rupture.  The release occurs inside the enclosed equipment room and may overpressure the building.  If overpressure occurs, partial enclosure with direct contact with outside air is a mitigating factor.  The toxic end point is calculated with EPA's RMP*Comp software.   The toxic end point of the worse case scenario is 0.8 miles radius from the equipment building.  Residential population is estimated at 6,100.\n\nAlternate Case is more likely to occur than the Worse Case.  This may be a ?\" effective diameter orifice leading to an airborne release that represents various leaks including a leak of the pump seal. Operator response time to stop the leak is approximately 60 minutes. The maximum venting rate is 100 lbs/min. The toxic end point is 0.1 miles radius from the equipment room.  Within this distance are commercial and industrial receptors, but there are no residents.\n\nThe Topographic Map in Appendix E shows the radius of exposure for the toxic endpoints.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION\n\nThe process is designed in compliance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices as shown in the Process Safety Information and is a part of Process Safety Management (PSM.).  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, safe handling and operating procedures that we use, and training of our personnel.   Prevention Program 3 (PSM) as described in 40 CFR Part 68 is followed to accomplish these goals and should minimize the potential for an unplanned release of ammonia to the environment.  \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSysco released approximately 150 lbs of ammonia gas on 6/2/1997.  There were no on-site or off-site impacts to employees or to the public.  The fire department was notified "

A valve was replaced as a result of the accident.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\n\nEmployees of Sysco are not trained to respond to major releases of ammonia but will respond to incidental or minor releases.  An Emergency Action Plan is in place that meets the requirements of OSHA 29CFR 1910.38 (a) and includes:\n? Evacuation procedures and routes\n? Rescue and medical duties\n? Communications and reporting \n? Emergency Coordinator \n? Alarm system\n? List of emergency equipment \n? Employee training\nJohnson County Emergency Management /Olahe Fire Department and Hazmat Response Inc. will respond to major releases or when required by Sysco.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR IMPROVED SAFETY \n\nSysco believes that all incidents are preventable, and our goal is to not allow any incidents.  We will continue to assess the impact of our refrigeration operations and propose to design, build, operate, and maintain our facility so it remains safe and acceptable to local communities and environment.  We will continue to adhere to the highest standards for safe operation of our facility and the protection of the public and environment.  There are no facilities' changes planned at this time."
