Executive Summary \r\n\r\nInternational Paper Company (IP) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for IP workers, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, IP has developed and implemented Environmental and Workplace Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all it's employees and operations. The Environmental Policy includes the following:\r\n\r\nIP strives to minimize the environmental impacts of all our operations, processes, and products in a manner responsive to the needs of our shareholders, customers, employees, the communities in which we operate, and the public.\r\n\r\nThe Workplace Health and Safety Policy further includes:\r\n\r\nThe protection of our people and property as well as the prevention of all accidents, injuries, and illnesses, are core values at International Paper Company. As such, they are also key considerations in everything we do. Our success depends greatly on a work environment that is safe and healthy for all employees, visitors, contractors, and the residents of the communities in which we operate.\r\n\r\nIP believes that following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. IP has put in place an organizational structure to demonstrate its commitment to that belief. As part of this commitment, IP has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at IP and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule). One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at IP. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requ"

The risk management program at IP consists of three elements:\r\n\r\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule (regulated substances)\r\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance (covered processes)\r\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes\r\n\r\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\r\n\r\nAlthough the risk management program at IP helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at IP. In fact, IP has a comprehensive safety program in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance.\r\n\r\nIP limits the use of hazardous substances. Before using a hazardous substance at IP, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of IP'S RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, IP considers the potential for this substance to adversely affect IP workers, the public, and the environment and takes steps to prevent any such effects.\r\n\r\nIP works to prevent releases of the hazardous substances used at the facility.

Information on the technology and engineering design of the covered process includes the operating parameters and the design basis and configuration of the process equipment.\r\n\r\nWhen important information was not available from the design documents, it was developed through special projects or, in the case of operating parameters, during process hazard analyses of the process.  Many of the operating parameters are included in the operating procedures to help with the safe operation of the process.  These documents are used (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazards analyses, and (3) to help maintain the equipment.\r\n\r\n2. \tProcess Hazard Analysis. The Pensacola Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  IP primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\r\n\r\n3\tOperating Procedures.

Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\r\n\r\n7.\tPre-startup Review.  IP performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.  This review confirms that an employee has completed the requisite training.  The review also confirms that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\r\n\r\n8.\tCompliance Audit.   IP audits covered processes to be certain that the IP prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues for the covered processes.  IP assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate improvements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\n9.\tIncident Investigation.   IP investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar accidents can be pre"

      "SummaryText": "vented.  IP trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\r\n\r\n10.\tEmployee Participation.  The Pensacola Mill developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that IP workers participate in the development and continuous improvement of these prevention program elements. Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures. \r\n\r\n11.\tHot Work Permits.  IP uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Pensacola Mill. IP reviewed OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a) and created a Hot Work Permit Form to comply with these requirements.  Personnel who are to perform hot work are required to fill out the Hot Work Permit Form.  The Shift Supervisor reviews the completed form before work can begin.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the IP safe work practices orientation.\r\n\r\n12.\tContractors.  IP has established Contractor Guidelines for Safety and Health to outline expectations related to contractor work, at Pensacola Mill including work on the covered processes.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that IP only hires contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks.  IP explains to the contract supervisors the hazards of the process on which they and their employees will work, IP safe work practices, and IP emergency response procedures.  IP requires that the contractor supervisors also train each of their employees prior to beginning their work on a covered process.  IP periodicall"

      "SummaryText": "y reviews contractors' training documents and work performance to help ensure that safe practices are followed. \r\n\r\n1.3.2 Program 2 Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThere are no Program 2 processes at IP's Pensacola Mill.\r\n\r\n1.3.3 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, IP has implemented safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at IP.  The following paragraphs describe some of these safety features. \r\n\r\nChlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to a water absorber column, where a 1.0 wt % chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Chlorine dioxide is produced at the IP Pensacola Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to avoid transporting large quantities of the solution. Storing the chemical in a water solution greatly reduces the potential for off-site impact. Containment diking and sewers are provided in all areas where chlorine dioxide is used. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring in all areas where the potential for chlorine dioxide exists, providing early detection and helping to ensure a quick response in the event of a leak.\r\n\r\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nIP has completed a five-year accident history for the chlorine dioxide generation and distribution process at the Pensacola Mill.  There have been no accidents or releases involving a reportable quantity of chlorine dioxide at the Pensacola Mill in the last five years.  In fact, there has never been a release of a reportable quantity of chlorine dioxide at the Pensacola Mill.  \r\n\r\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\r\n\r\nIP has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances. The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\r\n\r\n1.\tinforming the local fire department and the public about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\r\n2.\tproviding proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to t"
