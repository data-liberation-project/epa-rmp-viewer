This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\n\nExxonMobil modified its safety programs in 1991 by adopting a structured safety management system entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS meets the requirements of ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, it concluded that the environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.  It went on to say, We further believe ExxonMobil to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Refinery, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes hydrogen sulfide, which is also a regulated substance.

This program uses all the parameters required by the RMP rule for both worst case (WCS) and alternate release (ARS) scenarios.\n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program 3 processes at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing butane.  The full tank inventory is assumed to release, completely vaporize, and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS. This WCS has an off-site impact.\n\nThe ARS for flammable substances at the refinery is a gasket leak at the gasoline blending facility of Butane followed by a VCE.  This ARS has an off-site impact. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Refinery.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements were implemented because some processes at the refinery meet Program 3 criteria and are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  In addition, ExxonMobil Corporation has implemented Operations Integrity Management Systems (OIMS) at each of its operations worldwide that includes the aspects of EPA's prevention program.\n\nBecause the refinery is focused on fuels production, most of the light hydrocarbons are mixed without regard to the purity of the components.

In all cases, the normal paraffinic component is heavier and has a higher energy value than the olefins or isomers.\n\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of the RMPlan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  To minimize rework, we selected October 27, 2003 as the date to begin collecting this information.  Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baton Rouge Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.
