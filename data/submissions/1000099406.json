The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\r\nOur Alternative release scenario is a hose rupture caused by a pull-away. A 25 foot unloading hose with a 4 diameter may break if a driver doesn't remove the hoses between the storage tank and the transfer vehicle. the active mitigation devices are assumed to work as designed, limiting the release to the contents of the hose. The release leads to a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of .03miles.\r\nPREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nTraining is provided to all employees every three years with a refresher review at least annually, whenever there is a change in the process, or whenever competency with the regulations is questioned.  Safety material is also offered for all LP Gas customers annually and offered to the local fire department personnel during their annual tour of our facility and operations.  Training courses consist of classroom lecture, current and approved videos or CD, testing both verbally and written, as well as demonstration and observation for each person working with the process to be certified while subsequent on the job training is always approved as well.\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThere have been no accidents involving LP Gas that have resulted in deaths, recordable injuries, property or environmental damage, including evacuations on or off site.\r\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CONTINGENCY PLAN\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our LP Gas system, it is our policy to notify the local community fire department and request that they respond to the"
