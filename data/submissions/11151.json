Wesfrac Facility Description\n\nWesfrac, Inc. located at 1629 21 Road in Fruita, Colorado is a Natural Gas Fractionation Plant and Bulk Fuels Blending / wholesale distribution facility. The facility receives Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) from several different natural gas process plants primarily located on the Western Slope of Colorado. These NGL\u0012s are fractionated by means of traditional distillation into four finished products; Ethane, Propane, Butane, and Natural gasoline.  The Ethane is used entirely by the facility for burner fuel for the furnace and to run a generator which provides electrical power for the facility. The Propane and Butane are sold on a wholesale basis as a finished product.  The Natural gasoline is blended with Octane which is transported to the facility via transport truck into finished motor gasoline which is sold wholesale to many of gasoline stations in Western Colorado and"

      "SummaryText": "Eastern Utah. All products at the facility are received by transport truck. The facility is not interconnected with any pipeline delivery system.\n\nThe facility is located on BLM property and has no residential properties within 3 miles of the facilities. The facility has 11 pressure vessels for storage of the NGL\u0012s and the finished products. The total storage capacity of the pressure vessels is approximately 293,000 gallons. The blending facility has several aboveground storage tanks for the storage of finished motor gasoline and octane blending components.  These atmospheric aboveground storage tanks have a storage capacity of roughly 750,000 gallons.\n\nIII. Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario release for this facility is based on a catastrophic release of all NGL products at one time based on the assumption that all NGL bottles and the plant are 100% percent full at the time of the release.  This worst case scenario is calculated with a total instantaneous release of  1,450,000 pounds of NGL in a vapor cloud explosion. The release was computed by means of RMP*Comp Ver. 1.06.  Based on these calculation the distance to an endpoint of impact would extend 0.9 miles or 1.5 kilometers from the center of the facility.  Each tank at the facility is equipped with some passive means of protection in the form of excess flow and fire valves.\n\nThe calculated worst case numbers are very conservative because it assumes that the entire facility would explode in a single episode. This is a false assumption as the facility consists of a series of  individual tanks and process units which are interconnected, however  it has been our experience based on case studies of explosions at similar facilities that the explosions come in a series as each tank or unit becomes hot enough to over pressure and blevis.  Despite the conservative approach to obtaining the worst case scenario we would have no offsite impact to public or environmental  receptors even with the exaggera"

The greatest and most significant offsite impact would likely be the involvement of the neighboring plant. This plant is a natural gas pumping and oderant injection site operated by Public Service Company of Colorado. The distance and direction of this facility with respect to orientation of  our NGL bottles would likely minimize the impact.  The facility would likely not be involved from the standpoint of igniting it operations, involving it in the release. However it would certainly be impacted from the standpoint of limiting at least partially and possibly entirely access to the facility while a release was ongoing at our facility.  The Public Service facility is an unmanned facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Wesfrac, Inc. facility is covered and complies with OSHA PSM, and SPCC programs in addition to doing a Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program in accordance with the new source performance standards regarding emissions of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants.   The SPCC and PSM programs provide excellent awareness and training especially with respect to possible release mechanisms, release response, and emergency response. The LDAR program  has been a very significant program to aid in efficient identification, and repair of leaking emission sources. This program has improved our entire preventative maintenance program by increasing employee  awareness with respect to leaking pumps, valves, compressors ect.. This increased awareness has aided in the identification of possible release points before they become a problem. Also as a result of this program we have developed a work order program which allows the employee to identify and document any environmental, health, safety, and maintenance problems.   \n\n\n\nV.

      "SummaryText": "RMP covered process in the past five years.  This accident involved the accidental release of  ethane fuel gas for the hot oil furnace at the Wesfrac, Inc. fractionator.  The incident occurred on May 28, 1997 and involved only one onsite personnel .  The incident involved an explosion at the furnace during the lighting process following a short turnaround at the fractionator.  The employee who had failed to follow written procedures for lighting the furnace tried to light it after a valve had been left open allowing the furnace to fill with a  large volume of gas vapors. These vapors exploded when exposed to the torch normally used to light the unit. The explosion physically blew the operator several feet form the furnace in addition to causing some minor header and  refractrory damage to the furnace.   The employee suffered  some significant burns to his face and hands  thus providing for a loss time accident. The explosion had no other onsite or offsite impacts.\n\n\n\nVI. Emergency Response Program\n\nCopies of the emergency response plan are contained in our SPCC plan which is located et the Wesfrac, Inc. facility and at the main office. A copy of the  Emergency Response Plan has also been submitted to both the Grand Junction Fire Department and the Fruita Fire Department as part of our annual SARA Title III reporting.  Our remote location puts us outside the dedicated fire districts for either Fruita or Grand  Junction however we have worked more closely with the Fruita Fire Department as it would likely be the first responder should a incident occur.  The facility is not equipped with fire protection water in significant amounts to adequately address anything  but the smallest of incidents.   Tthe general policy for the Emergency Response Program at the facility is that Wesfrac, Inc. employees will  not respond to any incident that would exceed the capacity of the onsite fire suppression equipment. Should the incident be too large the facility will be secured to th"

Training  for the emergency response plan is generally done in conjunction with our  SPCC training.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the simplistic nature of our plan and the limited number of employees at the facility we have never conducted drills for the Emergency Response Plan (ERP). We have however worked with both Fire Departments going over the facility and the location of the emergency shut off devices, fire extinguishers, location of the incident command center in addition to many of the other pertinent  elements of the ERP. We would anticipate that Fruita Fire Department would be the first responder and that assistance would be gotten form the Grand Junction Fire Department\u0012s Hazardous Materials Response Team.  The response team in conjunction with Wesfrac personnel would make notification as needed to the Mesa County Emergency Preparedness coordinator who would then activate the County wide emergency response plan if it is warranted. \n\n\n\nVII. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nIn an effort to improve both our environmental and safety practices Wescourt Group, Inc. the parent company to Wesfrac, Inc. has contracted outside compliance oriented firms to conduct assessments at Wesfrac, Inc. and other  interccompany facilities. The first audit,  a facility and safety plan audit was conducted by Environmental Audit and Assessment, and a second audit, an Environmental Management Systems Audit was conducted by Terracon, Inc.  Both audits noted areas with concern to safety which should be addressed. Addressing these deficiencies will be our fist priority with respect to  improvements to our safety program. Upon completion of these task  we hope to have in place an efficient management  system with respect to both environmental and safety concerns. This management system will lend itself to further improvements to safety as t"
