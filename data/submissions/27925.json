Therefore, the Kalkaska Gas Plant is classified as a Program 3 process under the ARP program.\n\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nFlammable Substances \u00bf Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe endpoint for worst-case release of flammable substances is 1 psi overpressure (i.e., 15.7 psia), resulting from a vapor cloud explosion. The ARP Program requirement for flammables assumes an instantaneous release and vapor cloud explosion.  A yield factor of 10 percent of the available energy released in the explosion shall be used to determine the distance to the explosion endpoint.  Since the worst-case release scenario for a flammable substance is based on the assumption that the entire quantity of the substance forms a vapor cloud, passive mitigation systems are not applicable. Condensate is the worst-case flammable release with a 0.68-mile distance to the endpoint.  In accordance with 40 CFR 68.25 (a)(2)(iii), two additional worst-case release scenarios were analyzed since potentially affected public receptors differ between the listed flammable substances evaluated.  Using the criteria outlined in the ARP rule (as discussed in Section 2.3.1), the analysis of deethanizer feed and ethane yields an impact radius of approximately 0.65 miles each.\n\nFlammable Substances - Alternative-Case Scenario\n\nA single alternative release scenario for all flammable substances is required under the ARP program.  A hypothetical, but likely to occur, release scenario has been identified for propane as follows.  A 3-inch pipe on the truck rack is sheared during loading, causing the entire contents to empty from the truck.  The propane will vaporize and may ignite in a vapor cloud explosion with an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure or a vapor cloud fire with an endpoint of the lower flammability limit (LFL) for propane.  The alternative-case release of propane resulted in a 0.33-mile distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint and 0.1 mile distance to the LFL endpoint.  \n\nToxic S"

(SWEPI) Kalkaska Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility\u00bfs processes.  The SWEPI policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED\nSUBSTANCES\n\nShell Exploration & Production Company (SEPCO) owns and operates the Kalkaska Gas Plant located in Kalkaska County, Michigan.  The Kalkaska Gas Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of a refrigerated lean-oil absorption natural gas processing plant designed to recover ethane, propane, butane, and heavier hydrocarbons from field gas and condensate as well as a natural gas liquid fractionation plant designed to recover propane from natural gas liquids.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility via pipeline.  Natural gas and ethane are removed from the plant by pipeline and extracted hydrocarbon liquids are removed by tank trucks and pipeline.\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, SWEPI identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  Listed flammable substances which are stored or contained in process above threshold quantities at the Kalkaska Gas Plant are butanes, propane, natural gas liquids, lean oil, condensate, deethanizer feed mix, natural gas, ethane and ethyl mercaptan.

Therefore, analysis of worst-case or alternative-case release scenarios for toxic substances is not required.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Kalkaska Gas Plant.  Because the processes at the plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs (EPA\u00bfs) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs (OSHA\u00bfs) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Kalkaska Gas Plant\u00bfs PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented.  Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues.\n \n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs.  These programs include Unit Safety Teams (which are made up of a cross section of employees and supervision), regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail-gate safety meetings, Hazard Communication, Safety Suggestion Forms, near-miss reporting, and special training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant actively seeks employee involvement in developing and conducting all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.

Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors if they have questions, comments, or suggestions.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP programs and to completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis (PHA).  The process safety information will be useful to the operators; the team performing the PHA; those in charge of training; contractors; those conducting pre-startup safety reviews; and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  \n\nThe gas plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and cont"

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.\n\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Kalkaska Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Kalkaska Gas Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emer"
