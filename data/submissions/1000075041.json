THE CHEMICAL THAT WE STORE THAT QUALIFIES FOR THE RMP IS CHLORINE GAS IN 150# CYLINDERS.WE STOCK BETWEEN 5000# AND 20000# AT ANY ONE TIME. WE AT SAVANNAH BRUSH AND CHEMICAL ARE VERY AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL RISK INVOLVED WITH HAZERDOUS CHEMICALS AND GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PREVENT ANY ACCIDENTS FROM OCCURING. OUR EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED IN THE PROPER LOADING AND UNLOADING OF HAZERDOUS CHEMICALS AS WELL AS SPECIFICALLY THE SAFE HANDELING OF CHLORINE GAS. THIS IS DONE BY HANDS-ON TRAINING AS WELL AS FILMS ON THE SAFE HANDLEING OF CHLORINE AND OTHER HAZERDOUS CHEMICALS.SINCE CHLORINE REACTS WITH OTHER CHEMICALS WE MAKE SURE THAT IT IS STORED SEPERATELY FROM OTHER CHEMICALS AT ALL TIMES.BECAUSE OF THIS WE ARE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT SINCE THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN 1972 WE HAVE HAD NO CHEMICAL ACCIDENTS. THE WORST CASE SENARIO FOR AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AT OUR FACILITY WOULD BE THE RUPTURE OF A 150# CYLINDER OF CHLORINE GAS IN WHICH ALL 150#S WOULD BE RELEASED.USING THE RMP COMP. METHOD THIS WOULD EFFECT A .3 MILE RADIUS OF OUR FACILITY. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR WE WOULD CONTACT OUR LOCAL HAZMAT TEAM AND BEGIN THE NECESSARY EVACUATIONS."
