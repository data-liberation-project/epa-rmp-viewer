Facility Policy: The management and employees of Augusta Farmer's Co-Op are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia through the use of proper equipment, regular inspections, maintenance and training of all persons that work with anhydrous ammonia. Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and local emergency planning committee so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information: The primary activity at this facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the soil as a crop production nutrient. \n\n3. Worst-Case Scenario/Alternative-Case Scenario: Worst Case Release Scenario--Based upon a release of 70,000 pounds (7000 pounds per minute for a 10 minute duration) of NH3 and using RMP Comp to determine the distance to endpoint of 3.1 miles and LandView V to determine population to be impacted is 909.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario--Alternative Release Scenarion is based on a 2\" pipe failure with a release rate of 6,000 pounds per minute over a 3 minute duration for a maximum loss of 18,000 pounds.  Using RMP Comp to determine a distance to endpoint of .5 miles, and LandView V to determine the population impacted is 581.\n\n4. Accidental Release Program: This facility complies with the various rules and regulations governing the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia including ANSI K61.1, OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 and regulations administered by our state agency. Training is provided on safe anhydrous ammonia operations for employees. \n\n5. Five-year Accident History: There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process at this facility in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program: Augusta farmer's Co-Op has a written emergency plan in accordance with OSHA "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic inspections and evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe practices and operations. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
