Our core purpose is to be the supplier of choice for customers worldwide.  Our stakeholders produce value added egg products utilizing liquid egg in either whole, white or yolk form.  We carry a full line of liquid egg and entree products.  Sunny Fresh Foods complies with all applicable laws and regulations; champions waste reduction, energy conservation, and protection of the environment.  Management recognizes that leadership in environmental protection is critical to all of our stakeholders, customers and the communities where we have a presence.\nAnhydrous Ammonia is used in our refrigeration system to maintain and control temperatures of our manufacturing processes.  This ensures that our products are processed and maintained at proper temperatures to inhibit microbiological growth. \nWe comply with OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), OSHA Emergency Action Plan, EPA Oil Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure plan (SPCC), and applicable EPCRA regulations at state and local levels.  Preventive Maintenance is tracked on computer based maintenance management system.   This builds trend history that is allowing us to become predictive vs. preventive in our maintenance and further ensures the safe operation of our system.  Management of Change and Pre Start Safety Review are principles from PSM that are being deployed to all of our process lines to ensure safe design.  Contractors are required to submit information on their safety performance and if SFF standard is met they are approved to work for Sunny Fresh.  Before work is started all contractors complete an orientation to ensure understanding of Sunny Fresh Safety policies, rules and permit procedures. \nSunny Fresh Foods, Lake Odessa, MI, has had no reportable quantity accidents in the last five years.

During this tour a review of our system and changes are addressed with them.  The HAZMAT team drills on a regular basis and drills are critiqued. Deficiencies are reviewed and corrective action taken.\nTo ensure continuous improvement, the environment, health and safety function has increased staff resources.  We have contracted with a consultant to assist us in revalidation of PHA's and to conduct compliance audits.   We continuously review industry practices and benchmark for applicable best practices to improve our ammonia system to make it safer for our stakeholders and the communities in which we have presence.\nThe refrigeration system has been redesigned and will be on line in spring 2006 with improved operating and safety systems.  A PHA has been completed for this new system and changes to the initial design have been implemented based on the PHA.  To ensure safety during this construction period, only an approved contractor is being utilized, pre job planning is performed, training will be conducted for operators, and improved safety systems have been designed into the upgraded system."
