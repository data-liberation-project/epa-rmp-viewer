      "SummaryText": "    Albaugh, Inc. is a manufacturer and formulator of generic farm chemicals. Included in our line of products is 2,4-D which has been used by farmers for weed control for over 40 years.  We have produced basically the same products for the past 25 years. Dimethylamine is used in the production of  2,4-D herbicides and is  the only chemical that is handled on this site which is included in the Risk Management Plan. We receive dimethylamine in tankcars and tanktrucks. We have a 15,000 gallon tank in our tankfarm in which we store dimethylamine as a 60% aqueous solution.\n    Our facility has had a very successful safety experience with no reportable incidents in the last 5 years.  Albaugh, Inc. is committed to safety from the senior management level and throughout the company.  Compliance with federal and state regulations is a priority.  Several company safety programs are in place; Process Safety Management, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, Hazard Communication and Community Right-To Know,  Safety Committee, written emergency procedures, and employee training.  Each new employee given Right-To Know training and  is issued a copy of the safety rules.  These programs combined with safe operating procedures, controls, and equipment contribute to the overall climate of safe working conditions. \n    Albaugh, Inc. plant is located on 32 acres of flat terrain in an industrial area of the community.  We are located within the flood plain with a general slope from northeast to the southwest.  Within the facility, a storm water drainage system manages water runoff. This system operates under an NPDES Permit issued by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and required monitoring of the outflows from this system is done by monthly, quarterly, and annual reports to the MDNR. There are several drainage systems that flow from the southeast to northwest across the facility, flowing in turn into a drainage system alongside the northwestern edge of the property.  This"

      "SummaryText": " system flows to the southwest and contains a containment basin with an emergency capacity of 40,000 gallons.  The containment has a chamber where treatment chemicals or absorbent materials could be added in the event of a spill.  A valve on the downstream side of the containment basin controls the flow through the basin.  There are serveral valves upstream of the containment basin, and ther is one valve downstream of the containment basin at the point where the drainage system leaves the property.  After passing through the containment basin, surface water leaves the property at the western corner of the site and flows west to St. Joseph Light and Power where it surfaces.  It continues to flow in a westerly direction, crosses a levee, and enters Brown's Branch.  Brown's Branch flows northwest until it reaches the Missouri River.  The area of the site that contains oil storage tanks is protected from the 100-year flood by a levee.  \n     \n\nWorst case senerios:\nAs manufacturer of herbicides we produce, package and ship our products.  One of our products uses the chemical dimethlyamine.\nFor the worst case scenario we have used the vapor cloud explosion, which would be an explosion from the storage tank, or from a railcar being unloaded. The quantity of chemical for this scenario was from the contents of the largest railcar in which we would receive shipments of this chemical. We conducted our own modeling. The model used was the EPA RMP*COMP. Using this model we found the endpoint would be 0.4 mile (2112 feet). There is no residential population within that boundry. There would be some impact on  two neighboring manufacturing facilities one of which is approximately 500 feet to the north and the other is 680 feet to the west  from the location of the dimethylamine process.  \n\nAlternative Scenario:\nThe alternative scenario is a fire from a liquid release from the 15,000 gallon storage tank. We conducted the modeling ourselves using EPA RMP COMP. The endpoint of this scena"

      "SummaryText": "rio is 0.1 mile. There is no residential nor any manufacturing employee population within this boundry. We feel that the impact from this would be minimal with no threat to life, health, or property.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe facility operates under  OSHA Process Safety Management. Additionally,\nthe facility operates under a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC Plan). This plan outlines procedures for plant operations pertaining to oil products and by extension all other liquid chemical products handled at this facility. This plan covers operations pertaining to Transfer,Loading, Unloading, Piping, Storage, and Containment of liquid chemical products.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:\nFacility personnel do not respond to emergency situations. They do clean up incidental spills of chemical products. The facility depends on arrangements with the local fire department to respond to emergencies. The fire department annually receives the facility EPCRA Report.  \n\nAccident History:\nDimetylamine has been used at this facility since 1972 and there have been no explosions, fires in in that time associated with the DMA process.\n\nPlanned changes:\nWe plan to have evacuation drills at least annually."
