Still, these facilities can benefit from an understanding of the rigorous demands of the (regulations such as the) PSM Standard by implementing some of the standard\u0012s more general process safety management requirements and procedures...Examples of operations that may employ more generalized PSM techniques include: use of chlorine gas in municipal water treatment systems; ammonia based refrigeration systems; ethylene oxide sterilizers in hospitals; and anhydrous ammonia used by farmers (Dennison, 1994).\n\nSimilarly, Smart & Final/Henry Lee has operated similar facilities for many years without incident.  In its \u0013Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures,\u0014 the Center for Chemical Process Safety supports the use of procedures tailored to the complexity (or, in this case, simplicity) of the process:\n\u0013Typically, when (1) the subject process has operated relatively free of accidents over a long period of time and the potential for a high-consequence accident is perceived to be low, and (2) there have been few changes to the process that would invalidate this experience base, then organizations will tend to select less exhaustive, less systematic, more experience-based HE (hazard evaluation) techniques...\u0014  (AIChE, 1992)\n\nIt is this experience base which Smart & Final/Henry Lee adds to a stable, well established process which forms the foundation for the RMP program which follows.  The RMP program, in the case of Smart & Final/Henry Lee, has provided an opportunity to examine and make beneficial changes to the facility\u0012s operational practices and level of awareness with its employees.\n\nThe remainder of this executive summary details the offsite consequence analyses performed for this facility.\n\nThe worst case release scenario was developed based on the Model Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration developed by the EPA (Model RMP Guidance) and the EPA\u0012s Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (April, 1999).

      "SummaryText": "former guidance is a useful resource for anhydrous ammonia refrigeration.  This guidance was written with a refrigeration facility\u0012s routine operations and procedures in perspective; therefore, the guidance provided in document is well suited for this facility\u0012s offsite consequence analysis (OCA).  The latter document is referred to specifically in the rule.\n\nThe rule states that the worst case release scenario should account for a release from the greatest amount held in a single vessel, taking into account administrative controls.  In the case of this facility, the modeled amount 4,003 pounds, which is the weight which corresponds to the volume of the largest vessel in the process.  No administrative controls were assumed for the model.\n\nAmmonia is a gas at ambient temperature (77oF) though the process is enclosed with direct contact to the outdoors, and it exists as a liquid in th process by virtue of compression/refrigeration.  Therefore, the worst case scenario follows rule 68.25(c), \u0013Worst-Case Release Scenario-Toxic Gases.\u0014  This portion of the rule specifies that the release will occur over a period of ten minutes.  The rate of release is therefore calculated at 400 pounds per minute.\n\nAll OCA parameters (e.g., wind speed, atmospheric stability class, height of release, etc.) were obtained from the rule, or from one of the two referenced documents.  Smart & Final/Henry Lee has retained these parameters in a report titled \u0013Offsite Consequence Analysis, Freezer (Anhydrous Ammonia) (June, 1999).\n\nDistance to the toxic endpoint was determined using the EPA/NOAA developed application RMPComp.  The endpoint was determined to be 0.6 mi.\n\nThe rule allows the facility to apply some knowledge of its process to model a more likely release scenario than the worst-case release scenario.  Section 68.28, \u0013Alternative Release Scenario Analysis\u0014 states that at least one alternative release scenario must be considered for this process.  The OCA parameters (as specified in Sec"

      "SummaryText": "The Smart & Final/Henry Lee freezer facility is a distribution center of perishable goods for Smart & Final/Henry Lee\u0012s local retail centers.  The facility occupies approximately 95,000 square feet of floor space on approximately 5 acres.  The facility consists of a -10 oF freezer, a  20oF freezer, a 40 oF dock space, a future office area, a refrigeration system equipment room, an electrical room, and an office area.  The facility is located at 2850 NW 120th Terrace, Miami, Miami-Dade County, Florida.  The refrigeration system has a capacity greater than 10,000 pounds of ammonia, placing the Smart & Final/ Henry Lee freezer facility within the applicability of the RMP rule.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process involves cyclic compression, condensation, cooling, and expansion of anhydrous ammonia.  No chemical reaction occurs, and mass is neither added nor removed from the process; only energy (in the form of heat) is exchanged in this process.  The ammonia is in a closed system which, with the exception of the original charge, neither requires a feed stream of ammonia nor produces an ammonia derived product.  The ammonia refrigeration process is a common, well understood and universally accepted process for cold storage.  In addition to the process knowledge gained by the industry\u0012s long operation of such process equipment, the industry also has the benefit of a trade association established to address the specific needs of the ammonia refrigeration industry (the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration).  The cold storage industry, with the exception of the PSM standard, is a relatively unregulated industry by virtue of the simplicity of the refrigeration process.  The following passage illustrates this point:\n\nThere is a large number of smaller distributors and consumers of hazardous materials, which would not ordinarily be subject to (regulation) because they do not use extremely hazardous substances in the threshold quantities that trigger application of"
