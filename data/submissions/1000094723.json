The site is located at 112 SELIT Drive, approximately 0.5 mile north of Interstate 85. \n\n\n\nActivities at the SELIT facility include polystyrene foam product manufacturing, which is identified by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code 3086 (Plastics Foam Products) and NAICS Code 32614 (Polystyrene Foam Product Manufacturing). \n\n\n\nThe facility has one 18,000-gallon tank for storage of propane/butane liquified gas, which is located approximately 350 feet west of the facility manufacturing building. The maximum intended inventory of propane/butane is 69,309 pounds (15,300 gallons at a density of 4.53 pounds per gallon) since company policy limits the maximum filling capacity of the tank to 85%. The facility also has added one 9,000-gallon isobutane tank with an intended maximum inventory of 36,005 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe gas is delivered to the facility by tank truck, which is unloaded into an aboveground storage tank using a transfer pump. Access to site (fenced gas storage area) is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, and authorized contractors. \n\nThe manufacturing building includes polystyrene extrusion process lines, reclaiming units for recycling product trimmings and waste product, and a warehouse area for storage of polystyrene sheet. The polystyrene foam underlayment production process involves injection of a blowing agent at high pressure into the extrusion lines, which contain polystyrene resin to produce foam sheets. The extruded and cooled sheet material is then transferred to the winder station where it is rolled up and packaged. The finished product is stored in the warehouse area until it is shipped.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe potential for accidental releases from operations at the SELIT facility is mitigated "

Since the SELIT facility has more than a threshold quantity of a listed substance in a process, the OSHA PSM standard applies, which is a set of procedures designed to protect worker health and safety in case of accidental releases. All facilities subject to OSHA PSM are assigned to Risk Management Program 3, and the required prevention elements are the same. Prevention protocols are specified in the OSHA PSM documentation for the SELIT facility.\n\n\n\nAppropriate responses to releases of regulated substances are documented in SELIT's Emergency Response Plan. Safety and emergency response programs are coordinated with the local fire department and the Banks County Emergency Management Agency. \n\n\n\n\n\n3. Five-Year Accident History\n\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage\". There were no accidental releases that occurred during the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n4. Prevention Program Elements\n\n\n\nSELIT has a management program in place that assigns overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program to a qualified individual, and clearly delineates accountability and responsibilities for specific delegated elements. The SELIT facility prevention program elements are specified in the SELIT OSHA PSM for the facility.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the internal safety system for the SELIT facility include the following: \n\n- Monitored ventilation system-The ventilation system sucks the building air at all potential gas emission points (including warehouse). The ventilation prevents gas accumulation and, as a result, the potential emergence of an explosive atmosphere. \n\n- Air condition humidity control-All areas of the building at SELIT are equipped with an "

      "SummaryText": "air humidification system, which ensures a humidity air level of more than 40%. An alert system has been installed, which immediately triggers an internal alarm indicating system malfunction, if the 40% humidity air level is not reached.\n\n- Gas detection system-The gas tank yard is equipped with a gas detection system consisting of two gas sensors and a flame camera designed to shut down the tanks. The gas/air concentration is constantly measured and monitored in the building and especially around the extruders. If the gas/air concentration exceeds 20% or 40% of the LEL (lower explosive limit), various measures are taken at the individual area of building and/or extrusion line.\n\n- Antistatic equipment-The extrusion lines are equipped with anti-static fans and rods (ionization blowers and bars), which minimize static charge of the foam.\n\n- Staffing-The Production Area of the building is required to be staffed with at least one person at all times. Thus, potential risks, fires, and malfunctions at the extrusion plants can be detected earlier and countermeasures can be taken.\n\n- Fire prevention-All employees of SELIT are trained annually. \n\n- Fire suppression-Each permitted fire suppression system installed at SELIT was engineered to protect a wide range of product and storage configurations. The suppression system has a capacity of 2,000 gallons per minute at 150 PSI.\n\n- Fire alarm system (ionization detector, heat detector, multisensor detector)-The buildings are equipped with fire alarms that are triggered in the event of a fire. The notification of the fire department is automatic. In addition, the alarm will be displayed in several key areas of the building. All trained fire fighters will go to the affected area for help. In case of fire or an electrical defect of a fire alarm, an automatic notification (call, email) is sent to the fire protection officer or his representative. Heat detectors are installed in the tent area and above each of the film blowing heads."

Emergency Response Program\n\nAppropriate responses to releases of regulated substances are documented in SELIT's Emergency Response Plan. Safety and emergency response programs are coordinated with the local fire department and the Banks County Emergency Management Agency.
