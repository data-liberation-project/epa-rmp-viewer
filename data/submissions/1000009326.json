Pursuant to this commitment, the City makes every effort to operate the wastewater treatment facilities in a safe manner, in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations and according to established good engineering and management principles.  \n\nThe Baton Rouge South Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) was designed by qualified and experienced engineers and all operating personnel received the necessary training for the safe operation of the plant.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n\nThe SWWTP receives domestic wastewater from the south third of the City's urban perimeter and provides secondary treatment to this wastewater.  Before being discharged into the Mississippi River, the treated effluent is disinfected with chlorine.  The use of this chemical makes the SWWTP subject to the provisions and requirements of Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.\n\nChlorine.  The SWWTP has two 5,000-gallon storage tanks (nominal size) to satisfy the chlorine needs of the wastewater disinfection process.  Each tank's working capacity is limited, by means of administrative controls, to a maximum of approximately 4,000 gallons, or no more than 50,000 lb. of  liquid chlorine per tank.  This chemical is delivered on the plant site by dedicated tanker trucks operated by the chlorine supplier.  All of the chlorine storage and handling facilities are enclosed inside a steel-frame and concrete building.\n\nSulfur Dioxide.  The SWWTP no longer uses sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.  By tightly controlling the chlorination dosage, it has been possible to maintain the residual chlorine level within required limits, without the need for any s"

      "SummaryText": "ulfur dioxide addition.  \n\nThe SWWTP no longer keeps any sulfur dioxide inventory on site.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\nThe requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 includes, among other items, the development of a Worst-Case Scenario (WCS) and an Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for the possible release of significant quantities of each regulated toxic substance (chlorine).  The Executive Summary (ES) submitted with the original RMP included a discussion of the WSC's and ARS's for both chlorine and sulfur dioxide, in compliance with such requirements.\n\nConsidering that the operation of the chlorination system has not undergone any changes that would affect either the WCS or the ARS for chlorine since the original RMP was submitted, the original WCS and ARS for this chemical and their underlying assumptions are still valid.  The WCS and ARS for sulfur dioxide are no longer be applicable (this chemical is no longer in use, as mentioned above), therefore they are not included in this RMP update.\n\nThe chlorine WCS and ARS will not be discussed further in this Executive Summary (ES).  In accordance with the 2004 revisions to 40 CFR Part 68 (69 FR 18819-18837, April 9, 2004), it is no longer required to include a discussion of the WCS's and ARS's in the ES.\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n1.0    Safety Information\n\nThe South Wastewater Treatment plant of the city of Baton Rouge keeps on site the necessary documents related to the operation and maintenance of the plant in a safe manner.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals (not only chlorine but sodium hydroxide solution - caustic - as well); operating limits for all key process parameters; record of the current inventory of these chemicals; and data on equipment design and specifications.\n\nThese documents include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n* Copies of current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's) for the chemicals involved\n* "

They show material inventories and a record of the shipments of chemicals delivered on site.\n\nThe above records are updated as applicable and necessary.\n\n2.0     Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA detailed review of the hazards (Process Hazard assessment, or PHA) associated with the operation of the chlorination system at the SWWTP was last performed June of 2004 and a new one has just been performed within the last few days.  The Process Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) review technique was used to identify any hazards and to ensure that the necessary controls are in place to manage such hazards.\n\nA team of individuals representing the operations, maintenance, safety, engineering and management departments conducted the HAZOP review and a report that presents and discusses the \"Action Items (AI)\" is currently being prepared.  This report will be submitted to management for resolution.  The corrective action(s) identified for each AI, as well as its final resolution, will be documented.\n\nFurther, since the sulfur dioxide system at the SWWTP is no longer in operation, a new PHA for this system was not deemed necessary.\n\n3.0     Operating Procedures\n\nThe SWWTP keeps on site copies of all operating and maintenance procedures that were prepared and submitted to the city by the plant design firm.  These procedures address not only normal plant operations but other operating modes such as start-up, normal shut-down, emergency shut-downs, start-up following emergency shut-downs, etc.  These procedures also address the removal of individual components from the process for inspection and/or maintenance and they discuss t"

As a part of this training, the employees were given written tests to verify their understanding of the process, the operating conditions, the hazards inherent in the materials being handled and the appropriate responses to alarm conditions and emergencies.  \n\nAny time that the process undergoes modifications, changes or improvements, all operators affected by such changes will be provided with the necessary training.

These audits will determine how effectively the policies and procedures of the RMP have been implemented.  The audit findings are submitted to management for resolution and corrective action as necessary and applicable.

The objectives of such investigations are:\n\n* to establish the facts relating to the incident, \n* to determine the factors causing or contributing, directly or indirectly, to the incident, and\n* to define what corrective actions, if any, are necessary to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.\n\nThe incident investigation team includes members of the staff who are familiar with the process involved in the incident and also includes personnel from the operations, maintenance and management departments.\n\nThe investigating team submits its findings and recommendations to plant management for resolution.

This plan was revised and updated in March, 2,001.\nAt the State of Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality's (LDEQA?s) request, the full text of the emergency response plan was submitted in 2001 as part of a few minor corrections made to the RMP at that time.
