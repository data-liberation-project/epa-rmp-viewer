Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at InChem Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Specialty Chemical Manufacturer.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] and Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-].  Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is used for Phenoxy resin production.  Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-] is used for proprietary resin production (toll manufacturing).\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Methyl Capped Glycol.  In this scenario 191690.10 lb. of Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.7 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic e"

In the worst case scenario for this process 240739.89 lb. of Epichlorohydrin  [Oxirane, (chloromethyl)-] is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 35707.69 minutes.   Passive mitigation systems such as dike(s) are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.39 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.076 mg/L.  This distance is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-] involves a release from Methyl Capped Glycol.  The scenario involves the release of 191690.10 lb. of .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 300 minutes.   Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.82 mg/L of Methyl chloride  [Methane, chloro-] is 0.35 miles.\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nInChem Corporation maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years or significant process modification, whichever is shorter.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 09/04/1997.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, InChem Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nInChem Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently depending on operating procedural changesand needs.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nInChem Corporation carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at InChem Corporation to manage changes in process chemicals"
