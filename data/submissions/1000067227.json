The regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia with a total inventory charge\r\nover the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. Since the facility is also subject to the\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's PSM Standard 29 CFR\r\n1910.119, Program 3 is required.\r\n\r\n1.2       ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\nPOLICIES\r\n\r\nThe Fresh Express, Streamwood facility has an emergency response plan in\r\neffect. The emergency response plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and\r\nResponse section of this PSM/RMP document. This plan was designed to meet\r\nthe following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To save lives.\r\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3. To protect the environment.\r\n4. To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nFresh Express, Streamwood maintains a Process Safety Management committee\r\nwhich contains members who are the emergency coordinators for the facility. The\r\nemergency action plan provides the response organization and notification\r\nprocedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation\r\nprocedures for which will be implemented to take action effectively to emergency\r\nsituations that may arise at the facility. This plan is reviewed and updated at least\r\nonce per year. This plan was updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and\r\nRMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\n1.3       STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe ammonia process was designed and constructed in accordance with all\r\napplicable federal, state and local regulations. The facility is located at 1109 E.\r\nLake Street, Streamwood, IL.\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system uses ammonia for the storage of various food\r\nproducts.

The ammonia refrigeration system installed was designed and constructed\r\nin accordance with ammonia refrigeration industry safety and design standards. In\r\naddition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room or on\r\nthe engine room roof. The engine room is provided with continuous ventilation\r\nand all equipment is monitored for temperature and pressure 24 hours a day.\r\nThe facility is secured and guarded at all times.\r\nIn addition to the International Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in\r\naccordance with the\r\nInternational Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.

The emergency action plan\r\nincludes procedures for informing the public and local response agencies of a\r\nchemical release. The emergency action plan also includes information on\r\nemergency health care.\r\nFresh Express does not respond to emergencies. Fresh Express coordinates its\r\nEmergency Action Plan with the Streamwood Fire Department.\r\nIn the event that an ammonia leak is discovered, the person nearest the leak will\r\nnotify a supervisor, maintenance or risk management.
