If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  It is the policy of Coash Inc. that any personnel that will be handling, involved in storing, or transportation of NH3 will be trained in the safe handling of it.\n \nThe primary activity at Coash Inc. is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and Wholesale customers.  Chemicals and lawn fertilizer are also sold.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 160,000 pounds in our one 18,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be unloading a rail car weighing 42,000 lbs.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 160,000 pounds.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.58 miles based on the Degadis Modeling.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be a release from a break in a transfer hose at our anhydrous load-out or a tank on the premises resulting in a 4,000 pound release.  The distance to the endpoint is .73 miles based on the Degadis Modeling.  \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at our facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nOur facility has implemented the following:\na.

Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additiona; specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.  Coash Inc. strives to provide all employees with a safe and healthy working environment.  We feel each employee has a personal responsibility to work safely and maintain a workplace that is free of unsafe and hazardous conditions.  It is the policy of Coash Inc. that any company personnel that will be handling, involved in storing, or transportation of NH3 will be trained in the safe handling of NH3.  Safety meetings are held and attendance lists are kept on file."
