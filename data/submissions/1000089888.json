No passive mitigation was considered to limit the severity of the Alternative Case scenario.  Active mitigation was considered for the Alternative Case, in the form of the response of properly trained and equipped personnel from the Shasta Cascade HazMat Response Team (SCHMRT) following established emergency response procedures.

Shasta are categorized as administrative (management) programs, procedures, training, engineering controls, and emergency response programs.\r\n\r\nThe City of Mt. Shasta has instituted a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program meeting OSHA requirements at 29 CFR 1910.119 and CalOSHA GISO Section 5189 covering the disinfection and dechlorination processes at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The PSM Program constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for the City's operations at this facility. The program and document management procedures, included in the PSM Program, are used as the Risk Management Program management system.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine (sulfur dioxide) have been identified and implemented.

The chlorine is used for disinfection of wastewater effluent prior to discharge.  The sulfur dioxide is added at the end of the chlorination disinfection process to remove residual chlorine.  The system operates in the following manner: Pressurized chlorine (sulfur dioxide) gas within a ton container is reduced to vacuum by tank-mounted vacuum regulator valves. It is metered through rotameters, and rate valves automatically set the amount in proportion to flow and desired chlorine residual. Finally, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are drawn into water solutions by the passage of pressurized water through injectors.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nIt is the policy of the City of Mt. Shasta that the receipt, storage, and handling of RS's at its facility be done in a manner that meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  To accomplish this goal, the City has gathered safety information on chlorine (sulfur dioxide) and on the process, equipment, and procedures involving chlorine (sulfur dioxide); and performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process. The City has performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program to prevent and mitigate accidental releases. It has also established a written emergency action program and coordinated with emergency response agencies. The City is a non-responding facility per California General Industrial Safety Order 3220.\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS\r\n\r\nAdministrative controls in effect at the City of Mt.
