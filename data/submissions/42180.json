Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Country Pride Services in Fulda, Minnesota are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Fulda Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility?s primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in two interconnected 30,000-gallon tanks at our facility in Fulda, Minnesota (Figure 1).  There are no nurse tanks at this location.  The maximum amount stored is 51,000 gallons (262,446 pounds) at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\n\n3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios (NOTE: #3 Available only to County Emergency Management Director, Fire Department and Country Pride Services - not included with disk to EPA for public access per Federal Regulation posted 2004)\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention requirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\nProcess Safety Information\nCountry Pride Services maintains a detailed record of saf"

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nCountry Pride Services maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes (Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nCountry Pride Services has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nCountry Pride Services conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.
