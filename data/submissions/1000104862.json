The high pressure receivers receive high pressure liquid from the condensers and supply high pressure liquid to each zone of refrigeration. The high pressure receivers are also used to provide storage for ammonia not being used in the process at any given moment. The high pressure receivers are each equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system. Under normal conditions, the high pressure receivers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nFlooded Accumulator\nThe purpose of each flooded accumulator is to provide a supply of low pressure liquid ammonia to the evaporators. Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulators. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates.

Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nAir-Cooling Evaporator (Direct Expansion)\nThe purpose of the direct expansion air-cooling evaporator in the machinery room is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporator receives liquid from the high pressure receiver. The evaporator is equipped with an expansion valve which reduces the pressure and temperature of the liquid as it enters the evaporator. The evaporator contains a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporator uses an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it exits the evaporator and is returned to the main suction accumulator.\n\nMain Suction Accumulator\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity into the liquid transfer vessel. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high level situation. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors. Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\nLiquid Transfer Vessel\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer vessel is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver.

Once the liquid level in the liquid transfer vessel reaches the float switch, the three way solenoid valve is energized for a period of time causing the liquid transfer vessel to become subject to high pressure and allowing the liquid to drain by gravity into the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer vessel can contain either high or low pressure liquid and vapor.\n\nCompressors\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\n\nEvaporative Condensers\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions, the evaporative condensers contain high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nOil Coolers\nThe purpose of the oil coolers is to remove heat from the oil being circulated through it. The oil coolers receive liquid from a water line. High pressure liquid and vapor exits the oil cooler and is returned to the thermosyphon vessel. Under normal conditions, the oil cooler contains high pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\n\nAuto-Purge"

      "SummaryText": "r\nThe purpose of the auto-purger is to remove non-condensable gases from the system without requiring the system to be manually opened. The auto-purger consists of the following components: water bubbler, foul gas line, liquid line, suction line, water line, drain line, and remote purge point solenoid valves. The auto-purger removes non-condensable gases by refrigerating the foul gas so that the ammonia vapor condenses to liquid and can be returned to the system. The non-condensable gases are removed from the system through the water bubbler. Under normal conditions, the auto-purger contains small quantities of ammonia and water.\n\nSafety Systems\n\nAmmonia Detection System\nThe machinery room is equipped with an ammonia detector. A Dr\u00e4ger PointGard II provides detection and alerts personnel if the ammonia concentration exceeds 25 ppm. Audible/visual alarms are available outside the machinery room. If the concentration reaches 25 ppm, the emergency ventilation system will be activated.\n\nThere are two ammonia detection sample systems installed at Grapeman Cold Storage Delano. Each sample system is equipped with an ammonia detector, vacuum pump, and tubing which extends to the rooms where air is sampled. The vacuum pump is used to draw air through the tubing into the detector. On two minute intervals, the system toggles from one sample point to the next. The sample systems provide ammonia detection to non-machinery rooms as summarized below:\nShipping Office Sample System 1\nCold Storage Rooms 1-8\nShipping Office Sample System 2\nPrecool Rooms 1-6\nCold Storage Room 9\n\nIf the sample system detects an ammonia concentration exceeding 25 ppm, the system will activate an audible and visual alarm and notify plant personnel of the situation through the auto-dialer.\n\nRelief Valves\n\nAll ASME pressure vessels and positive displacement compressors are equipped with relief valves designed to relieve pressure and protect the equipment from rupturing.
