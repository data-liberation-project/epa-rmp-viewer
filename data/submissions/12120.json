Its warehouse and storage facility located at 100 Quantico Ave. in Bakersfield, California, store various chemicals for resale.  The chemicals are purchased from manufacturers or their representatives, brought to the Argo Chemical facility, unloaded, stored temporarily and reloaded for shipment to the customer.  The following are key elements of the RMP plan:\n\n(a) Argo Chemical is basically a retail operation and not subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard.  However, Argo chooses to incorporate all the elements of the Program 3 Prevention program, worst-case scenario analysis, alternative release analysis, 5-year history, document management system, process safety information, training, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audit, management of change, pre-startup review, employee participation, hot work permits and emergency response plan.\n\n(b) The stationary sources and the regulated substances handled are:\n\nCompressed Chlorine Gas\nThis product is handled by Argo Chemical in one ton and in 150 pounds pressurized cylinders.  The cylinders are received via truck and unloaded using a forklift.  The full cylinders are stored by securing them with chains to storage cradles made of steel.  For delivery to clients, the cylinders are loaded using a forklift onto the bed of a truck on which they are secured with straps during transport. \n\nCompressed Sulfur Dioxide\nThis product is handled by Argo Chemical in one ton pressurized cylinders.  The cylinders are received via truck and unloaded using a forklift.  The full cylinders are stored by securing them with chains to storage cradles made of steel.  For delivery to clients, the cylinders are loaded using a forklift onto the bed of a truck on which they are secured with straps during transport.\n\n\n(c) In the highly unlikely event (worst-case scenario) of a mechanical failure of one of the cylinders"
