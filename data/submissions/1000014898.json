      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe Poet Biorefining-Mitchell, facility (formerly Prairie Ethanol) is located approximately seven miles northwest of Mitchell, SD in Davison County.  Poet Biorefining-Mitchell\u00c2\u00bfs main product is denatured ethanol for use as motor vehicle fuel.  Production at the facility was initiated in December 2006.  Poet Biorefining-Mitchell produces ethanol using the dry mill method.  Corn meal is mixed with water and a digestive enzyme to produce starch, which is cooked and liquefied.  The resulting mash is cooled and a secondary enzyme is added to convert the liquefied starch to fermentable sugars.  Yeast is added to the mash to ferment the sugars to ethanol.\n\nThe fermented mash (beer) contains about 10% alcohol and is distilled, then passed through a dehydration system to produce 200-proof anhydrous ethanol.  After final dehydration, the ethanol is collected in two 1,500,000-gallon storage tanks for addition of a denaturant (natural gas condensate, NGC) to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption, per federal and state requirements.  The NGC denaturant is stored in Tank No. 805, which has a capacity of 120,000 gallons (approximately 750,000 pounds).  NGC is blended with the ethanol via circulation blending in the 1,500,000 gallon storage tanks.  The denatured ethanol is shipped from the facility in tank trucks and rail cars.\n\nCHEMICALS REGULATED UNDER EPA\u00c2\u00bfs CHEMICAL ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe NGC denaturant is the only CAPP/RMP regulated chemical present at Poet Biorefining-Mitchell which exceeds the CAPP quantity thresholds for applicability of the regulation.  The CAPP/RMP regulated process consists of the NGC denaturant storage tank, the two 1,500,000 gallon storage tanks and the associated blending/transfer equipment and piping.  The denaturant is added to the ethanol to a concentration of 1% to 3%.  The greatest CAPP regulated quantity of denaturant in a tank, vessel or piping system is the maximum capacity of the denaturant storage tank ("

In the event of an emergency, Poet Biorefining-Mitchell\u00c2\u00bfs Emergency Coordinator will direct internal response activities to the extent they are within the qualifications and capabilities of company personnel, taking reasonable precautions to prevent or minimize the extent of release or the co-mingling of materials.  There is no facility emergency response team.  Employees within their designated work areas will respond to small releases, if such response does not pose a danger to their health or safety.  In the event of a larger release, it is the policy of Poet Biorefining-Mitchell to notify the Mitchell Fire Department and evacuate all employees at the facility.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM & CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nPoet Biorefining-Mitchell is committed to protection of the environment through the combined use of inspection, maintenance, employee training and response preparation.  Public access to the facility from the highway is restricted by a gate.  Much of the property is fenced, limiting vehicle access.  The plant is fully lighted. Personnel are typically on-site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  There is a general computer based alarm system installed at the property.   The alarm system includes monitoring of the storage tanks and denaturant blending system (level control and overfill monitors).  The alarm system is monitored in the control room for abnormal conditions, which trigger visual control panel alarm lights and audible alarms.  All of the facility storage tanks have secondary storage containment and are included in the facility Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCI"

There has been one accident since startup of the plant in Dec 2006 which requires inclusion in the five-year accident history required by Subpart B of the CAPP/RMP regulation. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nPoet Biorefining-Mitchell\u00c2\u00bfs management team is committed to an on-going system of reviewing changes in available technologies and any previous plant incidents to identify opportunities to improve plant safety.  Planned changes to improve safety include a multi-camera video surveillance system, and a total water recovery (0 discharge) project."
