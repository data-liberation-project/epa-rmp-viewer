Emergency Response Program:  Our facility has a written Emergency Action Plan.  Employees are trained to respond to minor releases of anhydrous ammonia, but we do not plan to have our employees respond to major release.  If a large release of andydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the release, call 911, and call all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.  Additional facility emergency contact is Mr. John Tanner, assistant manager, (620) 228-8058."
