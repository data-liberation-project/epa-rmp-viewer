(PDC) acquired the Troudt 18-27 Pad in Weld County, Colorado, with a GTUIT gas processing skid and natural gas liquids (NGL) tanks. PDC owns and operates the site and provides a gas stream to GTUIT's skid. GTUIT will remotely operate and maintain the gas processing skid with three NGL tanks. The gas processing skid is designed to process the site's vapors and recover liquid products from vapors by physical and thermal separation. The gas processing skid is considered a small natural gas processing plant for regulatory purposes. NGLs recovered from this process are marketed for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nPDC and GTUIT each have a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the companies' efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process. PDC and GTUIT's policies are to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Troudt 18-27 Pad is located approximately 7.1 miles southeast of Windsor, Colorado. From the intersection of County Road 31 and County Road 66, drive 0.75 miles east on County Road 66 and then drive 0.5 miles south to reach the site. At this location, the gas processing skid process is used produce the following products:\n\n\n\n1. Y grade mixture from natural gas (also known as NGLs)\n\n2. Light Gas\n\n\n\nThe NGL product contains methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same c"

      "SummaryText": "omponents. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThere is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Troudt 18-27 Pad. The scenario consists of a vapor cloud explosion involving 72,872 pounds of a flammable mixture contained in one of three full 18,000-gallon NGL tanks. The WCS results in the largest impacted area with a 0.3-mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe site is located near residences and farms. The WCS has an offsite endpoint and would affect several nearby public receptors. PDC and GTUIT have controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences. Mitigation measures include but are not limited to relief valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, grounding equipment, and rupture disks.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the Troudt 18-27 Pad is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 9,674 pounds of NGLs from a pipe between an NGL tank and the processing skid. The release would occur from a break in the 1-inch pipeline that would involve 180 pounds per minute being released for 60 minutes before the leak was stopped. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.2 miles, which could potentially impact an offsite endpoint or a nearby public receptor. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nGTUIT's gas processing skid and NGL tanks are not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since they can be operated remotely and GTUIT does not keep employees at its location. This results in the process being Program Level 2. The following sections detail how PDC and GTUIT comply with the Program 2 requirements for accident prevention. \n\n\n\nA. Process Safety Information/Process Controls\n\n\n\nPDC and GTUIT keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These tec"

Identification of necessary regulatory equipment design documents\n\n7. Sufficient information to assure good engineering practices\n\n\n\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS). For specific areas within the process, PDC and GTUIT have documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual. The companies maintain the overall process within these limits by using remote controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \n\n\n\n B. Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Troudt 18-27 Pad identifies, and control hazards associated with the RMP covered scenario. This program systematically examines and explores for potential hazards, then establishes controls to put in place to manage the potential hazards. The hazard review is conducted using checklists by PDC and GTUIT's employees and/or consultants who have operation, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience. This review evaluates and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards identified. The findings are forwarded to PDC for rev"

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least five years. \n\n\n\nH. Compliance Audits\n\n\n\nAt least every three years a Compliance Audit addressing OSHA, EPA, RMP and Good Engineering Practices are conducted by employees and management of the Troudt 18-27 Pad. This audit team will develop findings that are forwarded to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are completed. Final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nI.

      "SummaryText": "FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe Troudt 18-27 Pad has been operating since late-2018. There have been no accidental releases from a covered process that resulted in death, injury or significant property damage on site, or known off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage. \n\n \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Troudt 18-27 Pad site is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The company maintains written emergency procedures, which are in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. These procedures identify steps to be taken in case of an accidental release. However, the GTUIT skid is an unmanned process and PDC company personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires. In an emergency, PDC's employees are trained and able to shut down the GTUIT skid. Should a release occur from one of the NGL tanks, the facility would rely on the local fire department to respond.  \n\n\n\nEmployees receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. The Troudt 18-27 Pad site has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.\n\n\n\nRMP MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\nPDC has assigned responsibility for the Risk Management Program to the Production Supervisor with the assistance of the Senior Environmental Representative and other Environmental, Health and Safety staff. PDC and GTUIT maintain a management system to oversee program elements.\n\n \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\n\n\nThere are currently no planned changes to improve safety. Rather, the companies believe that diligent compliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework that allows for the c"

Some of the key components of the program that will help maintain and, where applicable, improve safety are:\n\n\n\nEnsuring that PDC and GTUIT consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\n\n\n\nThe hazard review provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards. \n\n\n\nEnsuring that equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous release thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\n\n\n\nInternal and third-party compliance audits will ensure that PDC maintains and increases the level of safety protection.\n\n"
