      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan has been implemented at the Fontana, California facility for the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials. The warehouse facility is operated by Ozburn-Hessey Logistics (OHL), and located at 13277 San Bernardino Avenue, Fontana (San Bernardino County), California. The facility is a storage and distribution warehouse that houses consumer products packaged in aerosol cans for The Scotts Company, LLC, which is headquartered in Marysville, Ohio.  Based on the materials and the processes and results of the offsite consequence analysis discussed below, this plan meets the requirements of Program 1.\n\n\n\nThe aerosol cans are manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son, and consist of consumer product brands Off and Raid.  Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in the aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under EPA's RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of propane, butane and isobutane blends.  The maximum potential quantities of aerosol products containing these substances were conservatively based on the forecasted shipments for the facility for 2012.  The maximum product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum potential inventories of each RMP-regulated chemical in the warehouse storage process.  Although the actual amounts in the warehouse at any given time should be much lower, the estimated maximum potential amount of each substance is: \n\n\n\n?    Butane:    529,560 lbs\n\n?    Isobutane:    264,780 lbs\n\n?    Propane:     264,780 lbs\n\n\n\nA worst case scenario was performed using the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance and provided software (RMP*Comp) for a vessel with the greatest amount of propellant mixture (maximum 93% by weight).  The maximum quantity of each substance in a single vessel is: 0.68 lbs butane, 0.26 lbs of isobutane, and 0.26 lbs of propane.  The software predicts that the maximum distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint for this mixture will not exte"

Note that the RMP*eSubmit program requires that the quantity of each substance be rounded to the nearest pound (1 lbs), and that the impact radius be reported to two significant digits in miles (0.01 mi).  \n\n\n\nNo offsite receptors would be impacted under either scenario.  When not being handled for shipment, all aerosols are stored on pallets with a maximum height of 5 feet within a dedicated explosion-proof room constructed with blast walls.  A secondary \"aerosol room\" is occasionally used for \"picking\" of small amounts of product on open pallets.  This room is in compliance with local fire codes for the aerosols.  There have been no prior accidents at the facility associated with this process.\n\n\n\nThis process has been incorporated into the facility's emergency response plans and safety programs.  These are provided to San Bernardino County (LEPC) in the Business Emergency / Contingency Plan which is reviewed and updated annually.  OHL maintains a Facility Emergency Action Plan which is also reviewed annually.  It was last revised December 19, 2011.  Facility managers and supervisors are required to complete the training.  All employees are also provided emergency response and safety training at the time of hiring and renewed every three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
