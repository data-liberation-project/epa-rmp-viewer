      "SummaryText": "e Program\nA facility Emergency Action Plan is established to give direction to employees for safe response actions to be taken during fire and other emergencies. Potential chemical releases from the nitrogenous slow-release plant food process and glyphosate formulation process are addressed in the Emergency Action Plan including notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and medical assistance procedures.  Plant Managers, Production Managers, Supervisors, and the Drexel Environmental Health and Safety personnel are responsible for ensuring operating procedures for their processes are reviewed and updated at least annually and informing process operators of changes to operating procedures that affect their responsibilities.  Operating procedures are reviewed as often as necessary to ensure that they reflect current operating practices, including changes associated with process chemicals, technology, and equipment and changes to facilities.  Drexel certifies annually that operating procedures are current and accurate.  \nArrangements are established with the local emergency response agency, the fire department, and local hospital.\nDrexel provides training to all employees when they are hired and before they begin their assignment. Employees receive training to familiarize themselves with all exits and evacuation routes.  An annual training session is conducted during a weekly safety meeting.\nEvacuation drills are held at least once a year or when a change is made.  Drills are evaluated by the plant manager regarding effectiveness and timeliness.  Employees are asked to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the drills. \nAfter a drill, the plant manager judges the effectiveness of the plan and reviews any employee input concerning the drill.  Employees may identify something that requires a change to the procedure or was ineffective.  For example, they may discover new doors that would not open; they may enter storage closets instead of exits; or they may get los"

Drexel Chemical believes that risks associated with anhydrous ammonia and MIPA storage at this facility are well managed.\n\nSOURCE AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nDrexel produces agricultural chemicals.  The anhydrous ammonia is stored in one aboveground storage tank at the facility and is used in the nitrogenous slow-release plant food process.  The MIPA is stored in one aboveground storage tank at the facility and is used in the glyphosate formulation process.  Both tanks are located in a secondary containment dike.\nOverall responsibility for the RMP for the nitrogenous slow-release plant food process and glyphosate formulation process is assigned to the Plant Manager.  Employees are responsible for following the requirements of this policy.  Employees are encouraged to actively participate in the PSM program.\nDrexel consults with employees on the development and subsequent review of process hazard analyses (PHA) and on the development of other elements of the standard.\nUpon request, Drexel provides ready access to PSM program files and documents to employees and contractors, whose work is covered by the PSM program.\nDrexel makes use of a PSM team comprised of employees and supervisors that actively engage in the implementation and management of the PSM program.\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nDrexel develops and implements written operating procedures that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process.
