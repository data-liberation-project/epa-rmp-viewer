This document includes Process Safety Management as required by OSHA. Ramon Rosales, a Project Manager for CH2MHILL, is the responsible official at the facility. \n\n\n\nThe City of Donna Water Treatment Plant is located at 801 South Hutto Road, Donna, Hidalgo County, Texas (north 26.160667 latitude and west -098.070027 longitude). four one-ton containers of chlorine are stored in the facility.  Two of them are connected to the system at one time.  The facility is staffed 18-hours a day and operators check the chlorination building daily. Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) are stored in the office located approximately 100 to 200 feet away of the chlorination building.\n\n\n\nRMP regulations for Program 3 processes require the performance of a consequence analysis for one worst-case release scenario, estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to a toxic endpoint. The worst-case release scenario selected involved the complete loss of the Chlorine to the air. The 4,000 pounds worst-case release quantity selected represents the greatest amount held by interconnected vessels. The RMP*Comp32 results indicate that the maximum distance needed for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 10-minute release of 4,000 pounds of chlorine is 1.9 miles. The total potentially affected population with the entire area of the circle is estimated at 15,800persons. \n\n\n\nOne alternative scenario was selected for the offsite consequence analysis. The scenario selected involves the failu"

This is equivalent to a release rate of 267 pounds of chlorine per minute. The RMP*Comp32 dispersion modeling results indicate that 0.3 miles is the maximum distance for the concentration of chlorine to reach the toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L) as a result of a 15 minute release of 267 pounds of chlorine per minute. The total potentially affected population within the entire area of the circle is estimated at 0. \n\n\n\nPopulation estimates are based on 2000 U.S. Census Bureau data from LandView&reg;5 and MARPLOT. The Donna population has increased more than 30% in the past decade, so the potentially affected population should be higher than the numbers used in this report.  Most of the growth in Donna has occurred outside of the 1.9-mile radius, therefore, although the population has increased, it has not increased 30% within the area in question. \n\n\n\nA search of MARPLOT Satellite and Topographic maps did not identify any offsite impacts of environmental receptors within the endpoint. Environmental receptors include natural areas such as national or state parks, forests, or monuments officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas.\n\n\n\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at this facility. \n\n\n\nThe Donna Water Treatment Plant Accidental Release Prevention Policy involves an approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices in compliance with all applicable EPA Prevention Program 3 requirements and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include availability of Self-Contained-Breathing-Apparatus (SCBA) that operators wear during the connection/disconnection of chlorine, and staff awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine.  Donna Water Treatment Plant personnel employed the HAZOP technique to conduc"

After answering the questions, they discussed the adequacy of the existing safeguards and recommendations for additional safeguards. The staff finished the Process Hazard Analysis with an equipment inspection. All equipment was inspected during the Process Hazard Analysis. The Process Hazard Analysis will be updated at least once every five years.  \n\n\n\nDonna Water Treatment Plant ensures that each employee presently operating the process, and each employee newly assigned to these processes have been trained or tested successfully in the operating procedures listed above that pertain to their duties. Annual refresher training provided to each employee operating the chlorination process ensures that the employee understands and adheres to the current operation procedures of the process.\n\n\n\nThe Donna Water Treatment Plant emergency procedure addresses potential emergencies that can reasonably be expected to occur at the facility. The emergency response procedures consider dangers within the plant that may affect employees as well as dangers outside of the plant that may affect the public or the environment. These procedures comply with EPA Risk Management Plan and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements set forth in 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe Donna Water Treatment Plant personnel are not first responders, although they are trained in response techniques and will notify other first responders in the event of an accidental chlorine release. An emergency response plan is kept on-site where all employees have access to it. Chemical Response and Remediation Contractors, Inc., is the first responder, as well as the Donna Fire Department.\n\n\n\nThe City of Donna Water Treatment Plant posts escape plans within the facility where any person entering can see them.
