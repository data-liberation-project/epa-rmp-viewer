EcoElictrica employees must conduct Company operations in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Environmental laws either prohibit or severely restrict the release of pollutants to the air, land, surface water, and groundwater.  The Company is committed to the environmental protection, and it expects employees to abide by letter and the spirit of these laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Sustances Handled\n\nEcoElictrica, L. P. owns and will operate a liquefied natural gas (LNG) marine unloading and storage terminal and a 507 MW combined cycle power plant. The EcoElictrica facility is located in the Municipality of Pequelas, Puerto Rico.  It will provide additional electric power to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA).  Other facility processes are a closed cooling water system, a demineralization plant to produce water for steam production and boiler water for the Costa Sur Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority; and a remineralization plant to produce potable water for the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). \n\nThe LNG stored at the terminal will be vaporized to form natural gas which will be combusted in the power plant combustion turbines.  Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) will be an alternate fuel, and low sulfur No. 2 distillate oil will serve as emergency backup fuel, in the event that LNG or LPG are not available.   The power plant consists of a combined cycle generating module which includes two combustion turbines/generators exhausting into separate heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs).  The HRSGs produce steam that will be routed to a steam turbine /generator and to a desalination plant capable of producing fresh water from sea water.  \n\nAmmonia is s"

A maximum of 75,158 pounds of ammonia will be stored at the facility at any given time.\n\nChlorine is stored at the facility in 1-ton containers.  EcoElictrica has the capacity to store 13 1-ton containers of chlorine.\n\nEcoElictrica will use anhydrous ammonia for the control of NOx emissions generated during combustion processes.  Ammonia will be stored within the EcoElictrica premises.  For the potable water system, EcoElictrica will use and store chlorine onsite.  EcoElictrica has the capacity to store chlorine and ammonia (anhydrous) over the RMP threshold quantities (2,500 lb and 10,000lb respectively).\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Ammonia\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of the 15,000 gallon storage tank, over a period of ten (10) minutes, due to a tank rupture.  \n\nThe analysis for anhydrous ammonia was made taking into consideration the topography, which was determined to be rural and any passive mitigation, such as dikes or enclosures.\n\nThe \"alternative release scenario\" for anhydrous ammonia is assumed to be the release of anhydrous ammonia through a safety valve that due to overpressure of the 2 inch internal diameter pipe used to fill the anhydrous ammonia container, releases anhydrous ammonia for a period of 10 minutes, over rural topography.  \n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios for Chlorine\n\nThe \"worst-case release scenario\" for chlorine is assumed to be the release of the entire contents of one container, over a period of ten (10) minutes, due to a container rupture.  \n\nThe analysis for chlorine  was made taking into consideration the topography, which was determined to be rural and lack of any passive mitigation, such as dikes or enclosures.\n\nThe \"alternative release scenario\" for chlorine is assumed to be the a leaking 3/8 inch internal diameter flexible connection tubing used to connect the chlorin"

Due to the actual conditions of the facility, the information required on sections 7.4c and 7.7-7.15 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) are based on a HAZOP study.\n\nAt this stage, the general EcoElictrica accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n- High level of training of the operators.\n- Preventive maintenance program.\n- Use of state of the art process and safety equipment.\n- Use of the accurate and effective operating procedures that are being written with the participation of the operators.\n- Performance of hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n- Implementation of an auditing and inspection program. \n\nThe chemical specific prevention steps include availability of personal protective equipment and self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to be worn by the operators and awareness of the hazardous characteristics and properties of both subject chemicals.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nEcoElictrica is a new facility.  Therefore no accident history is available for the chlorine or ammonia processes.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n  \nThe EcoElictrica facility is included in the community emergency response plan prepared by the local emergency planning committe under 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (LEPC 5 - Environmental Quality Board -Ponce).  EcoElictrica will rely on the local emergency response agencies for responding to a release of one the regulated substances.  It has prepared an Emergency Response Plan as per Rule 107 (C) of the Regulation for the Control of Atmospheric Pollution (RCAP) and a Contingency Plan which include the following tasks.\n\n1.
