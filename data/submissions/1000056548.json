      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nLake Palestine Water Treatment Plant lies outside the city limits with boundaries delineated by a chain link fence.  The site has appropriate buffers from residential areas.  The Lake Palestine Water Treatment Plant remains an essential facility for the City of Tyler.  The plant treats and pumps approximately 30% of the city's potable water.  This treatment plant is the secondary source of drinking water for the City of Tyler's estimated 110,000 residents. The Lake Palestine Water Treatment Plant runs intermittently May thru December. The Plant is located southwest of central Tyler on County Road 192.\n\n\n\nThe operator's mission at a water treatment plant is to maintain public health by providing safe drinking water, free of pathogens.  This involves the addition of chemicals that, if released in an uncontrolled manner, may present a risk to public health.  While such incidents are rare, they do occur.\n\n\n\nThe state-of-the-art methods for risk management of highly mobile toxic chemicals, such as chlorine and ammonia, have evolved recently.  Our job in developing an RMProgram is to reduce the risk to employees and to the public of injury or death from accidental release of these chemicals.  The RMProgram is focused on preventing accidental chemical releases the have the potential for catastrophic impacts on the public.  The RMProgram does not address other more common potential occupational health incidents that can represent equally significant or greater risks to employees.  For this reason, the RMP program is not a substitute for conventional health and safety programs. \n\n\n\nWater treatment is the regulated process at this facility.  Chlorine and ammonia gas are used to disinfect the water making it safe for public consumption.  Chlorine gas for disinfection in water treatment results in one of the most cost-effective methods for meeting state and federal disinfecting rules and regulations.  The plant safely stores approximately 57,000 pounds of c"

There are 2-3000 gallon tanks located at the facility, housing more than 34,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Palestine chief operator drafted the written operating procedures around safety.  In addition, all operators must have a surface water operator's license from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  All employees who handle chlorine and ammonia know the dangers of the chemicals and how to safely handle the gases.  The plant manager has safety meetings on a regular basis.  At these meetings overall plant safety is discussed with employees.  At any time, employees can voice their opinions on how to improve plant and chemical safety.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Palestine Water Treatment Plant complies with the rules and regulations of the EPA RMP.  The most important preventative measure for avoiding accidental release involves the gas feed systems.  Due to the design of the chlorine process, the gas will cease to flow when a gas piping breaks.  This ensures that any failure in the process equipment will cease gas flow which helps to eliminate the chances of a chlorine or ammonia release.  A building with proper ventilation and fire resistant walls encloses the process area.  In addition, gas detectors in the process area will alarm personnel that a leak has occurred.\n\n\n\nAll operators are trained in the written operating procedures.  Preventative maintenance procedures aid in changing out wearable parts before they fail.  For example, pigtails are changed out annually or at any sign of deterioration and all gaskets are replaced after any servicing.  Inspections of the storage area and process area help to ensure that all valves and components are quite capable of proper shut down to isolate and stop leaks.  Any valve that turns with difficulty gets replaced.  In addition the SCBA's are tested on a monthly for proper functioning.\n\n\n\nThe Lake Palestine Water Treatment Plant has had one accidental release since the "

Emergency responders were initiated but the leak had been stopped already by the operator staff.  One person had to be taken to the hospital but was released shortly thereafter. The accident occurred because of a hole  was discovered in the tubing on the feed system.  There were no off site implications.   Other than this one incident there have been no accidents on site and this is due to an exceptional training program and the overall design of the feed systems.\n\n\n\nIn addition to good training and following correct operational procedures other uncontrollable situations can arise.  For this reason an analysis for both chlorine and ammonia was performed.  Two cases were looked at for each gas: a worst case and an alternative case.  A worst-case scenario would include one of the ton chlorine cylinders or 3000 gallon ammonia tank failing, and the contents of the cylinder/tank being exposed the outside environment all at once.  The alternative case scenario involves estimating a puncture hole in a tank/cylinder.  After chlorine and ammonia were analyzed it was determined that if a tank/cylinder failed (worst-case) everyone within a 2.2 mile radius would need to be evacuated.  The speed of the wind and the wind direction would affect this evacuation area.  As of 2005 approximately 3,500 people live within a 2.2 mile radius of the facility. Evacuations for the alternative case scenarios are less than that of a worst-case: 0.4 miles for chlorine and 0.2 miles for ammonia.  It is estimated that 250 people live within a half of mile radius of the plant that would need to be evacuated, again depending upon wind direction and speed.\n\n\n\nUnder the City of Tyler Emergency Management Plan, response procedures exist where by emergency evacuation measures will be implemented as required.  Any incidence of toxic or hazardous chemical leak or spill subject to off-site contamination will result in a 911"

Tyler Water Utilities complies with Federal and State HAZCOM reporting requirements, thus all chemical quantities and storage locations are on file with the Tyler Fire Department and Local Emergency Preparedness Committee (LEPC).  Tyler's HAZMAT possesses mobile communication capabilities enabling them to access the LEPC's CAMEO software (located at the County Fire Marshall's Office in the Smith county Office Building). Thus, the evacuation area is clearly defined and City of Tyler Emergency Response personnel will implement evacuation procedures in accordance with the Emergency Management Plan.  The State Emergency Response Commission has approved the emergency management Plan.  In addition the same firm which has prepared this report was also hired by the City of Tyler to perform the mandated vulnerability assessment.  All of the findings were reported to and communicated with the City of Tyler and the Smith County emergency response plan."
