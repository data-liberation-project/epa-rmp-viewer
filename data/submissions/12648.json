      "SummaryText": "1.  The owners, management and employees of Champaign Landmark, Inc., are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with local fire departments, or any other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release on the public and the environment.\n\n2.  The Mechanicsburg facility is located just south of downtown Mechanicsburg.  The anhydrous tank is located here so that we can have rail access.  This location is used in accordance with the fertilize facility outside of town.  The anhydrous at this facility is used for agriculture only.  The maximum amount stored at this location is 132,600 lbs.  The maximum amount handled would be the unloading of a rail tank car holding 150,000 lbs.\n\n3.  The worst case scenario would be to loose the total contents of the anhydrous tank 132,600 lbs.  It would reach its endpoint of 200ppm at 1.16 miles in 10 minutes.  The alternative scenario would be a break in the 3\" transfer hose that would reach its endpoint at .59 miles in 2 minutes releasing 26,638 lbs of ammonia.\n\n4.  The Mechanicsburg town facility has implemented the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.111 for the storage and  handling of anhydrous ammonia.  ODA and other regulations are followed.\n\n5.  The Mechanicsburg town facility has not had a reportable accident in the last five years.\n\n6.  Champaign Landmark's Emergency Response Plan has been reviewed recently and gone over with all personnel.\n\n7.  Our company policy is to remain proactive in the areas of safety and accident prevention.  With the ODA - Workers Comp and our own audits we feel that the chances for accidental releases are minimal.  We are making no specific anhydrous ammonia safety changes at this time."
