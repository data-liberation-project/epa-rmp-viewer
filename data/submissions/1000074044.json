      "SummaryText": "The Baker Produce, Inc - Zillah facility is a fruit processing and cold storage facility located outside the City of Zillah, County of Yakima, State of Washington.  Anhydrous Ammonia, used as a refrigerant in the system, is considered a highly toxic chemical by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with a toxic threshold of 10,000 pounds.  Baker Produce has 11,300 pounds of ammonia in the closed-loop flooded system. Safety precautions are followed by the facility to prevent unnecessary human exposure, reduce threat to personnel and reduce threat to the community and environment.\n\n\n\nUntil recently the facility has maintained a quantity of ammonia under the toxic threshold of 10,000 lbs, in order to minimize the threat of a major release.  In an effort to perfect the quality and life of the fruit, more refrigeration was required.  Management has attempted to protect employees, the public and environment by keeping the risk as low as possible.   \n\n\n\nThe facility has two engine rooms, 21 controlled atmosphere rooms and 3 common storage rooms.  The largest vessel holds 8,244 pounds of ammonia (80% of capacity as recommended by ASME).  Isolation valves are located through the facility with remote operation and shutdown capabilities.  Engine rooms have outside kill switches and ammonia detectors.\n\n\n\nBaker Produce complies with OSHA, WA State process safety management rules and regulations, WA State safety regulations and IIAR standards for good work practices.  The ammonia refrigeration system was installed to standards and local codes at the time of installation.  Piping and equipment is secured and protected, engine room doors are tight fitting and open outwards.  Other safety systems include:\n\n  Computerized controls, which can be operated remotely\n\n  Suction trap hi-level float\n\n  High discharge pressure shut down\n\n  Low suction pressure shut down\n\n  High discharge temperature shut down \n\n  Oil pressure failure shut down\n\n  High amperes shut down\n\n  Automat"

Actions to prevent a major release shall be attempted only by refrigeration personnel from an area that is not threatened by release.  Other employees will be evacuated or sheltered-in-place as appropriate.  An emergency plan has been developed covering notification to public safety agencies and the public.  An evacuation plan for the plant has also been developed and all employees receive training on the plan.  The plan has been reviewed with the local fire department, and emergency drills are practiced each year.  The plan instructs coordinators to call 911, evacuate facility and wait for Emergency Responders to take control.\n\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedures and a system of Checklists and Calendars have been established for use by refrigeration personnel to insure safe operational functions.  Training on these procedures, ammonia safety and detailed mechanical integrity procedures will continue to be a major process at Baker Produce.  "
