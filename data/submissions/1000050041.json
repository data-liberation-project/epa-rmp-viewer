      "SummaryText": "This facility complies with NFPA-58 requirements for LP-Gas storage, and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Spokane County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We also have employees on site that are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) to handle small emergencies.\n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures carbon composite brakes for the aerospace industry.  The facility stores 48,000-gallons of propane on site for use in the brake manufacturing process.  Propane is stored in one 18,000-gallon tank and one 30,000-gallon tank.  The tanks are located approximately 10 feet apart and share common liquid and vapor piping to the facility.  \n\n\n\nOur worst case scenario is a failure that results in the release of the entire contents of the largest tank (30,000-gallons) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a pull-away explosion that would result from a propane delivery truck driving away without unhooking first causing a release of the entire 15 foot, 2 inch diameter unloading hose.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are not within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.       \n\n\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place."
