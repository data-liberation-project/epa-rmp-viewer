The facility is located on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids, Iowa at the intersection of 41st Avenue Drive and C Street Southwest.  This ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified facility employs 186 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.\n\n\n\nThe facility manufactures enzymes, fermentates, and whole cells for food, animal feed, and industrial use through a fermentation based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The facility's enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has maintenance and laboratory support.  Support staff includes site management, safety, health and environmental (SHE), engineering, purchasing, finance, and systems personnel.\n\n\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Maximum on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is approximately 130,000 liters.  The ammonium hydroxide Risk Management Program (RMP) covers ammonium hydroxide unloading operations, storage, transfer, and fermentation operations.\n\n\n\nChemical Safety\n\n\n\nThe site's overall approach to chemical safety is comprehensive.  Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from all affected areas of the plant prior to construction or use.  The goal is to provide a safe workplace while minimizing environmental impact.  Release prevention methods are implemented where possible, including automation, containment of all outdoor ta"

The PHA included a team of DuPont IB, Cedar Rapids members representing Logistics (process), Fermentation (process), Maintenance, Engineering, and SHE.  Five recommendations for investigation and improvement were generated from the Process Hazard Analysis.
