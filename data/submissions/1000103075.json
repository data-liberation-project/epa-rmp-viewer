For both the worst-case and the alternative release scenarios, the effected population is evaluated, and public and environmental receptors are determined.  \n\n1.\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis - Worst-Case Release Scenario.  The total affected area for the worst-case release scenario is approximately 0.28 mi2 (0.3 miles release radius).  Based on this scenario, there are no affected public receptors, which can include residences, schools, churches, and public recreation areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the vulnerable zone.\n\n2.\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis - Alternative Release Scenario.  The total affected area for the alternative release scenario is less than 0.03 mi2 (<0.1 miles release radius).  Based on this scenario, there are no affected public receptors, which can include residences, schools, churches, and public recreation areas.  There are no environmental receptors within the vulnerable zone.\n\n5.0\tRMP Program Level Determination\n\nThe USEPA regulations assigned three different levels of complexity to the RMP program, depending on certain criteria at the particular plant in question.  The GLOBALFOUNDRIES facility qualifies as Program 1 plant based on several factors.  Specifically, the GLOBALFOUNDRIES facility is eligible for Program 1 because: (1) there are no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from a worst-case release; (2) the process has had no release of a regulated substance (29% ammonium hydroxide) in the past five years where exposure to the substance has resulted in one or more offsite deaths, injuries, or response/restoration activities for exposure to an environmental receptor; and (3) the facility has coordinated their emergency response activities with the local responders."

The alternative release scenario [40 CFR Part 68.28] is considered the most likely release to occur from a covered process that is expected to produce the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.  The Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance provided by the USEPA recommends that the alternative release scenario be based on the following:\n\n1.\tThe scenario most likely to occur.\n\n2.\tThe meteorological conditions at the time of the release are characterized by a wind speed of 3 meters per second (m/s), an ambient temperature of 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C), and an atmospheric stability class D.\n\n3.\tActive as well as passive mitigation systems may be included in the analysis (if applicable).\n\nThe alternative release scenario most likely to cause off-site consequences is a release of the entire contents of a single 56,000-liter ammonium hydroxide storage tank, which is located within the HPM Dispense building.  A catastrophic release from the 56,000-liter storage tank would be contained within the secondary containment system for the ammonium hydroxide storage tanks.  The vapor emissions from the spilled ammonium hydroxide would be ventilated and exhausted through an acid scrubber with a minimum of 90% [normally operating @ 98% ]removal efficiency (ER)) ER before entering the atmosphere.  \n\nThe active mitigation measures of venting ammonium hydroxide emissions through the acid scrubber were considered as part of this alternative release scenario. \n \n4.0.4\tOff-Site Consequence Analysis.

      "SummaryText": "scenario is defined as the release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to an endpoint [40 CFR Part 68.25].  The endpoint or toxic endpoint of a substance is defined as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action [USEPA, 1998].  The Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance provided by the USEPA recommends that the worst-case release scenario be based on the following:\n\n1.\tFailure of the entire contents of an ammonium hydroxide tanker truck, which has a maximum capacity of 16,000 liters, during off-loading activities leading to an airborne release of the entire inventory directly to atmosphere at 18.6 gallons per minute.  The off-loading dock has an enclosed (>70%) secondary containment system.  There is also an ammonia detection system.  \n\n2.\tThe release rate is the full release rate during off-loading distributed over 10 minutes.\n\n3.\tThe meteorological conditions at the time of the release are characterized by a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second (m/s), an ambient temperature of 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C), and an atmospheric stability class F.\n\n4.\tPassive mitigation systems may be included in the analysis (if applicable).\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is defined as a release of 29% ammonium hydroxide solution from a delivery tanker truck during outdoor off-loading operations, where the entire contents of the 16,000-liter ISO tanker truck is released at 18.6 gpm.  The spilled ammonium hydroxide, from a tanker truck hose rupture or pump failure, for example, would be directed to the partially enclosed secondary containment system for the off-loading activities, which consists of a grated trench system.  The spilled materials are ultimately pumped out of the trench system for proper handling"

The threshold quantity for ammonium solutions at concentrations greater than 20% is 20,000 pounds.  The two 56,000-liter storage tanks, located in the HPM Dispense building, contain approximately 64,405 pounds of ammonia in total when full (in the form of 29% ammonia hydroxide solution).  These ammonia hydroxide tanks will feed product into the Delivery System Process located in the Fab 8 building, which is described below.\n\n2.0\tAmmonium Hydroxide Storage and Delivery System Process Description within the Fab 8 Building\n\nThe ammonium hydroxide storage tanks, which consist of interconnecting storage day tanks and associated piping located in Fab 8 Phase I & II buildings/areas, contain approximately 3764 pounds of ammonium hydroxide in aggregate total. A summary of these interconnecting tanks are as follows:\n\nPhase I\n529-Gal Tank of 29%\n\nPhase II\n559-Gal Tank 29%\n559-Gal Tank 29%\n\nInterconnected piping - 5% of total volume.\n\n4.0\tHazard Assessment\n\n4.0.1\tIntroduction. A Hazard Assessment was conducted for the GLOBALFOUNDRIES facility in accordance with 40 CFR 68 Subpart B.  The Hazard Assessment consists of the following tasks:\n\n1.\tworst-case release scenario analysis\n2.\talternative release scenario analysis\n3.\tdefining off-site impacts - population and environmental receptors\n4.     five-year accident history\n\nThe GLOBALFOUNDRIES facility currently uses 29% ammonium hydroxide solution, which is on the list of regulated toxic substances (40 CFR Part 68.130). The toxic endpoint for concentrations of ammonium hydroxide greater than 20% is 0.14 mg/L. \n\n4.0.2\tWorst-Case Release Scenario Analysis.  The worst-case release"
