Charlotte Western Railroad (herein also referred to as the Facility) has access to several rail spurs to store railcars and conduct transloading and unloading operations. The Facility transloads/unloads a variety of materials and products including butane, liquids such as recycled grease, solid powder products, and construction materials such as lumber, wood panel products, and drywall.\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the Butane Railcar Storage and Transfer Process at the Facility.  The Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading Process provides the Facility the ability to store up to 27 butane railcars on the Gastonia Siding, the Head Siding, and the Butane Transloading Track, and transfer butane to transports using portable transloaders.\n\nCharlotte Western Railroad complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) accident prevention rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR Part 1910.119). This Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading process is designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA #58 and the manufacturer's instructions. Railcars meet the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Railroad Administration design requirements for pressurized tank cars.\n\nCharlotte Western Railroad maintains an Emergency Action Plan and has been designated a \"non-responding\" facility\". As such, in the event of an emergency involving the Butane Railcar Storage and Transloading process, it is the policy of the Facility to evacuate personnel and contact the Gastonia Fire Department to request their assistance. Facility personnel have received emergency response training and all contractors and visitors are briefed on appropriate emergency actions prior to being permitted onsite.\n\nCharlotte Western Railroad has developed a pl"

In addition, representatives from the Gastonia Fire Department have been briefed on the process.\n\nThis is an RMP for a new facility and therefore, the Facility has never had an accident involving butane which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuation or sheltering in-place.\n\nIn an effort to improve and promote system safety, Charlotte Western Railroad looks for, and seeks employee input, on process safety improvements. Additionally, Charlotte Western Railroad intends to coordinate response with the local agencies annually at minimum."
