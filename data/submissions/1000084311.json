Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Diversified CPC International, Inc are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass purification and blending of Aerosol Propellants and high purity liquified petroleum gas products.  We have 12 regulated substances present at our facility, 10 of which are stored in bulk storage tanks, and the remaining two may be present in bulk iso-containers.  These substances stored in bulk tanks include Butane, Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-], Propane, Isopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-], 2-Butene, 1-Butene, Propylene [1-Propene], Pentane, and a Flammable Mixture consisting of Propane, Butane, and Isobutane. 2-Butene and Isobutene may also be stored in bulk iso-containers.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1980 Edition. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operat"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a combination of What-if/Checklist and HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Diversified CPC International, Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDiversified CPC International, Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.
