WWTP 1A also has sulfur dioxide; however, the RMP threshold for sulfur dioxide is not exceeded; therefore, sulfur dioxide is not included in this RMP submittal.  WWTP 1A is operated by Southwest Water Company (SWWC), a private company.\n\n\n\nThe City and SWWC has reviewed its obligations under EPA's Risk Management Program Rule (RMP Rule, Section 112&reg; of the Clean Air Act).  In response to these requirements, the City and SWWC note the following obligations incumbent on the operations at the chlorine disinfection unit (also referred to as the chlorinator unit) at WWTP 1A:\n\n(1) 112&reg;(1) - Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation, and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation.  The City and SWWC take this obligation seriously, and intend to be not only a good neighbor but also a leader in community safety and emergency preparedness. \n\n(2) Risk Management Plan - SWWC operates WWTP 1A, which stores and uses chlorine in excess of the threshold specified in the RMP Rule. SWWC has developed, and is in the process of further developing and implementing, programs to prevent any accidental releases and training for emergency response in the event of a release.  These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the chlorine water treatment process is to treat and disinfect municipal wastewater. Chlorine is delivered as a compressed gas in one-ton cylinders, and there are typically two cylinders stored at WWTP 1A at any one time.  As required by the RMP rule, SWWC has considered the impac"

Key elements from these two releases are included in the RMP submittal to EPA.\n\n\n\nThe City and SWWC have implemented safety precautions to prevent and mitigate a chlorine release.  These include maintenance, training, and inspection procedures, as well as an Emergency Action Plan. \n\n\n\nCity management and SWWC are committed to:\n\n-Preventing accidents;\n\n-Training employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\n\n-Providing leadership to the community with respect to emergency preparedness;\n\n-Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with facility operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\n\n-Being a good corporate citizen of Fort Bend County.\n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan provides information about the City's management of the risks associated with the chlorine disinfection process, but more importantly stresses the commitment to ensuring a safe operation for employees, visitors, and community."
