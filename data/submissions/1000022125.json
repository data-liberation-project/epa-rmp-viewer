It is Delano Growers Grape Products' policy to\ncomply with all applicable governmental regulations. Further, it is Delano Growers Grape Products' objective\nto be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nDelano Growers Grape Products owns and operates a grape juice concentrate production facility located at\n32351 Bassett Avenue in Delano, California. At Delano Growers Grape Products, grape juice is processed\nthrough ion exchange vessels (cation and/or anion vessels), depending on the specification of the finished\ngrape juice concentrate product.\n\nThe ion exchange beds must be regenerated periodically to maintain the ion exchange efficiencies. The\ncation beds are regenerated with a dilute sulfuric acid solution while the anion beds are regenerated with a\ndilute ammonium hydroxide (aqua ammonia) solution. A 30% solution of aqua ammonia is stored on-site in\ntwo 6,000 gallon tanks. The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia that can be stored in one of the tanks is\n47,000 pounds.\n\nFor purposes of the offsite consequence analyses, the RMP regulations define the toxic endpoint for aqua\nammonia as 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm). This concentration has been established by the American Industrial\nHygiene Association as the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).\n\nERPG-2 is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be\nexposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or\nsymptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario"

The offsite consequence analysis for a Program 2 process\nmust analyze the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario. Since Delano Growers\nGrape Products' aqua ammonia storage and anion column regeneration process is considered a Program 2\nprocess, both release scenarios were evaluated in the offsite consequence analysis.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis must include an estimate of the residential population within an area\npotentially affected by the accidental release scenario. This area is defined as a circle with a radius\nequivalent to the distance the release would travel with concentrations at or above the endpoint. The circle\nalso defines the area in which potential environmental receptors must be identified.\n\nThe worst case release is defined by the U.S. EPA as the total release of the contents of the single largest\nvessel or pipe within 10 minutes. An alternative release scenario is a release that is more likely to occur than\nthe worst-case release scenario. For Delano Growers Grape Products, the alternative release scenario was\nselected based on the results of the hazard review for the aqua ammonia storage and anion column\nregeneration process. A delivery hose failure event (hose failure or sudden uncoupling) with a high discharge\nrate would potentially have the greatest offsite impact and, therefore, was chosen as the alternative release\nscenario.\n\nDelano Growers Grape Products has analyzed the offsite consequences of the worst-case and alternative\nrelease scenarios. The aqua ammonia storage tanks have secondary containment dikes, which would greatly\nreduce the impact of a release. The modeling performed as part of this offsite consequence analysis for the\nworst case release scenario includes a mitigation factor which takes into account the dikes around the tanks.\n\nFor the wor"

No residences are located\nwithin 0.1 mile of the aqua ammonia storage tanks. Therefore, there would be no populations impacts from\nthe worst case release scenario. There were no sensitive receptors or environmental receptors within the\nworst case release scenario circle.\n\nIn the alternative release scenario, a failure of the delivery hose was modeled as a release of liquid aqua\nammonia. For a release of 949 lb/min of aqua ammonia, the model calculated that the plume would travel\n0.2 mile at concentrations at or above the endpoint. No residences are located within 0.2 mile of the aqua\nammonia storage tanks. As such, there would be no population impacts from the alternative release\nscenario. There were also no sensitive receptors or environmental receptors within the alternative release\nscenario circle.\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA general accidental release prevention program has been developed at Delano Growers Grape Products to\naddress the aqua ammonia storage and anion column regeneration process. This program includes the\nfollowing chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n   Safety information, including the Material Safety Data Sheet for aqua ammonia; the maximum intended\ninventory of the aqua ammonia storage tanks; safe upper and lower temperatures and pressures; equipment\nspecifications; and the codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the process, has been\ncompiled.\n\n  Compliance with federal and state regulations that address industry-specific safe design and industry-specific design codes and standards has been demonstrated.\n  \n  A hazard review was performed and will be updated and revalidated at least every five years.\n  \n  Written operating procedures have been developed and implemented, and are reviewed at least"

      "SummaryText": "anhydrous ammonia as the cooling medium for the chillers within each system.  When in operation, the ammonia is in continuous recirculation in each system.  Refrigeration System 1 contains one compressor, one evaporative condenser, one high pressure receiver, one thermosiphon vessel and one chiller.  Refrigeration System 2 contains three compressors, five evaporative condensers, one high pressure receiver and seven chillers.   Refrigeration System 3 contains one compressor, one evaporative condenser, one high pressure receiver and two chillers.  Vaporization of ammonia at different points of the system provides the needed cooling effect.  In addition, as an added safety feature, all relief valves are vented to two interconnected diffusion tanks in order to minimize the potential for atmospheric releases of ammonia. \n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nDelano Growers Grape Products has implemented a Process Safety Management (PSM) program to manage the safety aspects of the Ammonia Refrigeration Systems.  In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The program includes strict requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, contractor safety, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.  Management of change element addresses proper implementation of system updates to ensure that all changes are reviewed properly by knowledgeable persons, all engineering documents and operating procedures reflect the change, and personnel are trained on the change.   Process Safety Management also requires a pre-startup safety review to ensure that the system is properly reviewed before it is put back into service after a major change.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history (December 2005 to December 2010) for the Delano Grow"
