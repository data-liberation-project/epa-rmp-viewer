The Village of Endicott Department of Wastewater Treatment (WWTP) accidental realease prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, proceedures, and management practices.  All applicable proceedures of the United States Enviromental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  The WWTP emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are designed to this facility and to the emergency response services available in the local community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n b.  The Village Wastewater Treatment Plant serves the communities of the Village of Endicott, Town of Vestal, and the Town of Union.  The plant is located at 40 Anson Road south of Route 17C, next to the mouth of Nanicoke Creek and the Susquehanna River.  The plant provides preliminary, primary and secondary treatment of wastewater's, anerobic sludge digestor's, in-vessel composting, wind row storage, chlorine disinfection, and SCADA monitoring equipment.  The chlorination room is located in the main building and contains liquid chlorine containers, leak dectectors, scales, and a vacuum feed chlorination system.  The amount of chlorine handled is four one ton containers, two in service and two in storage on average.  The facility is manned with day shift operators Monday - Saturaday.  The SCADA system monitors all major plant and liftstation activities 24 hr/day.  This system incorporates a telephone dialer feature that calls plant personnel in the event of \"alarms\" during times that the facility is un-manned.  \n\n c.  The offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case realease\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quanity in the largest vesse"

      "SummaryText": "l is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".  The worst case scenario at the Endicott Wastewater treatment plant involves a failure of the two one-ton containers which are connected concurrently (a total of 4000lbs of chlorine).  Such a failure is estimated to release 2000 lbs at a 200 lbs/ 10 min release rate, with a 20 min realease duration.  Based on a EPA selected wind speed estimate of 1.5 m/sec, atmospheric stability class of \"F\",and  topography selected as \"Rural\", the estimated distance to endpoint is calulated at .10 mi.  Estimate of rural population effected is 0.   Alternative release scenario involves the rupture of the flexible and rigid piping connected to two one ton containers, possibly due to material defects, over-pressurization of system, or \"Acts of God\".  Actuation of chlorine detectors, audible alarms, SCADA monitoring, and telephone dial-up to stand-by personnel and emergency response crews are identified as an active mitigation measures taken.   \n\nd.  The general accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n     -  Hazard awareness training of all plant personnel and emergency response personnel\n     - Preventive maintenance program\n     - Use of SCADA alarm monitoring, telephone dial-up, and 2 chlorine detection equipment systems\n     - Annual equipment audits and safety training program reviews\n     - Actual \"hand-on\" emergengy response team training\n\ne.  No accidental releases of chlorine have occurred at this facility in the last five years.\n\nf.  The facility has an emergency response program, which is coordinated with the Village of Endicott Fire and Police departments.  Village Fire Department is a member of the County Local Emergency Reponse Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.
