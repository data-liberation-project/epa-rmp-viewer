EGP NA believes that no monetary value can be placed on human life and therefore will provide procedures for the primary purpose of preserving life and secondly to preserve its assets at this location. \n\n\n\nEGP NA expects its employees to respond only to incidental releases of hazardous substancesand not to major, uncontrollable releases where employees are expected to immediately evacuate the site. Therefore an Emergency Action Plan, which is a part of the Emergency Response Plan,has been developed to detail the evacuation procedures. \n\n\n\nThe Cove Fort Geothermal Plant is a binary geothermal power generation facility built on a combination of Private, Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service leases as well as Enel owned properties.The project is designed to produce approximately 23 MegaWatts (MW) of electricity. (Unit Nameplate Gross Capacity 12 MW X 2)\n\n\n\nA binary geothermal plant operates utilizing two closed loop systems that exchange heat energy. The first loop is a geothermal fluid that is pumped from production wells to the plant. This hot geothermal fluid (brine) passes through a heat exchanger where a portion of its heat ebnergy is given up and then flows into injection wells where it is pumped back into the underground resource. The second loop is the working fluid, in this case Pentane, which is  pumped from an accumulator vessel as a liquid to the heat exchanger where the heat from the geothermal fluid (brine) vaporizes the Pentane into a superheated vapor. In the vapor state the Petane passes through the turbine which drives the generator that produces the electrical energy. After the Petane passes through the turbine, with the pressure and temperature reduced the vapor pa"

It is then gravity fed back to the acumulator vessel at which point it will begin the cycle again. During normal operations the Pentane and Geothermal Fluid (brine) are never in direct contact with each other and there are no losses to the external atmosphere.\n\n\n\nEGP NA  complies with all requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Mangement Standard 29 CFR 1910.119  and the EPA Risk Management Plan 40 CFR 68.63. All program elements are administered by the Safety, Envronment and Quality Specialist (SEQ) for the region as well as the Regional Geothermal Operations Manager and Facility Manager.The Facility Manager and his/her straff are responsible for the day to day compliance and and implementation of these satndards. Empoloyees at the facility are aware of these standards and have access to and are included in the development of the internal procedures that align with these standards. Employees are encouraged and required  to participate and contribute to each of the elements of these programs; Process Safety Information, Process Hazard Analyisis, Standard Operating Procedures, Safe Work Practices, Mangement of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Review, Incident Investigation, Emergency Action/Response Plan, Contractor Safety Training, Preventative Maintenance/Mechanical Integrity, Employee Participation and Verification of Compliance Audits. EGP NA is an ISO 14001 and ISO 18001 Certified company that utilizes an HSE Management System to assure compliance with local, state, federal and internal Safety and Quality Standards and regulations. \n\n\n\nEGP NA has incorporated various safety systems into the design of the Cove Fort Geothermal Plant. These features enhance the overall safety of the system , its operations and the personnel onsite as well as the public. Specific measures include an Emergency Shut Down System capable of taking the plant off line s"
