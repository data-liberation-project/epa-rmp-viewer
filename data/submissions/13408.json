      "SummaryText": "materials, combustible vapor detectors, and fire extinguishers.\n7 Training in proper first aid and medical treatment.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFacility processes are routinely changed to improve safety as a result of employee suggestions, process hazard analyses, incident investigations, and others.\n\nEmployee's suggestions are encouraged and evaluated for its feasibility.  This facility believes that an employee's suggestions should be strongly considered because of their detailed knowledge in the operation of the equipment.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted prior to commissioning of any equipment after changes are made.  This ensures that all potential deviations from normal operating parameters are evaluated and corrective actions taken if necessary.\n\nIncident investigations are performed to understand the reasons why, when, how, and what occurred during the incident.  From the investigations, long-term corrective actions are implemented to ensure the least chance of reoccurrence.  \n\nSome past changes that have been implemented to improve safety include:\n7 Switching to gaskets that are more resistant to corrosive materials.\n7 Pumps which transfer ethylene oxide and propylene oxide no longer use packing glands.\n7 Increasing the number of stationary combustible gas detectors.  \n7 Readiness for the Year 2000 (Y2K) potential computer bug.\n7 Connecting all stack emissions for ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and ethylenediamine to a central control device which decreases the emissions to the atmosphere."
