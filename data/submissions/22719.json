The distance to the endpoint is approximately 3.1 miles.  \n\n4.  ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a transfer hose connection.  The distance to the endpoint would be 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n6.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.
