The Dallas Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Dallas, TX. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nMotiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva) - Dallas Terminal in Dallas, TX is committed to operating and maintaining processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Motiva believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding EHS performance is of paramount importance.\n\n\n\nThe Dallas Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community. Motiva promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nThis document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Motiva has designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\n\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\n\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of regulated chemicals;\n\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\n\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nA.

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. Motiva Enterprises LLC - Dallas Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors/visitors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Dallas Terminal.\n\n\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel). The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truckloading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending/injection skid and auto-analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail safe), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and HMI, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Dallas Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC\n\nPREVENTION MEASURES\n\n\n\nMotiva's accidental release prevention programs along with emergency planning and response programs allow affective management of the hazards posed by Butane to our employees, the public, and the environment.
