Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are reviewed updated regularly. \n\n\n\nAshland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in local organizations.\n\n \n\nDescription of facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\n  \n\nAshland's Calumet City facility manufactures a variety of acrylic and phenolic resins for the Specialty Polymers and Adhesives industry.  Fifty weight percent formaldehyde (formalin) and vinyl acetate monomer are the two substances present which are regulated under the USEPA Risk Management Program Rule, 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is highly unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  The USEPA requires that one worst-case scenario be reported to represent all regulated toxic substances held above the threshold quantity.  Additional worst-case release scenarios must be reported for those covered processes that could potentially affect different offsite public"

      "SummaryText": " receptors.  Ashland reported the worst-case scenarios for both formaldehyde and vinyl acetate monomer. The Calumet City facility has never had a release of formaldehyde or vinyl acetate monomer that resulted in an offsite impact.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved modeling methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors.  The administrative controls and passive mitigation measures considered in the worst-case analysis for both formaldehyde and vinyl acetate monomer were diked containment and restricted capacity.\n\n\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n\n\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require an analysis of the alternative-case release scenarios.  The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.  The USEPA requires that the results of the alternative-case release scenario analysis be reported for each toxic present.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the alternative-case release scenarios for formaldehyde and vinyl acetate monomer do not impact offsite public receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or passive mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distances reported.  The active mitigation measure considered in the alternative-case analyses for each of the covered chemicals involved recognition of an individual present during unloading operations.\n\n\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n \n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered processes.  These procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, an effective mechanical integrity program, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review a"

      "SummaryText": "nd examination of potential incidents that could lead to an accidental release.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with top management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in the event of an emergency.  \n\n\n\nFive-year accident history. \n\n\n\nDuring the past five years, we have not had any releases of the regulated substances that have resulted in or could have resulted in an offsite impact.  \n\n\n\nEmergency response program:\n\n \n\nEmployees at our facility are Defensive Responders. \"Emergency Response\" releases (as defined in 29CFR1910.120) requiring offensive actions are handled by outside emergency response teams. Site employees are trained and instructed to implement defensive actions only.  This facility invites local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect the plant, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in emergency drills.  This facility also has a written emergency preparedness plan that is updated regularly.  The facility currently has five fixed foam systems for fire control and vapor mitigation.  In addition, the facility has three fixed water deluge systems.  The plant maintains a 4,000 gallon foam inventory.      \n\n  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\n\n\nOur facility continually evaluates and implements employee suggestions and recommendations resulting from process hazard analyses.  We make changes to improve reliability and safety based on information developed within our organization and industry.  Toward continuous improvement, we are looking at ways to minimize risk through process improvement, process re-design, and formulation substitution.  Ashland is committed to the implementation of the American Chemistry Council's RC 14001 management system."
