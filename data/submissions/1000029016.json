Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nThe Campbell Soup Plant in Napoleon, OH is committed to the protection of its employees, its property, and the environment.\n\n\n\nIn fulfilling this commitment, the plant will provide and maintain a safe and healthful work environment as indicated by acceptable business practices and compliance with legislative requirements, and will strive to eliminate any foreseeable hazards that may result in fires, security losses, damage to property or the environment, and personal injuries/illnesses.\n\n\n\nKey elements of the Napoleon Plant safety program are the precautions taken to prevent or minimize accidental releases of chlorine from the treatment systems and ammonia from the ammonia refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency response procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Lab Chemist is responsible for the management of the chlorine safety programs.  The Area Manager for Power and Utility Maintenance is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs. \n\n\n\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe Campbell Soup Plant in Napoleon, OH produces canned food products for sale to the public.  The facility uses chlorine in its water treatment and wastewater treatment systems. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia in the N-28 ammonia refrigeration system.  Chlorine and ammonia are the only regulated substances handled at the Napoleon Plant.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.   Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Pro"

Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Napoleon Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to chlorine spills, ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures and procedures for controlling chlorine leaks.  The program has been coordinated with the local Emergency Response Committee (Henry County Sheriff's Department).\n\n\n\n\n\nF.   Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe facility is adding additional equipment and safeguards to the N-28 ammonia refrigeration system.  With the addition of this equipment it is estimated that the ammonia inventory will increase above 10,000 pounds in this system. "
