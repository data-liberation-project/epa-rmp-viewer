Industrial Solution Services, Inc. management is extremely cautious in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about safety for its employees and the public.  \n\n\n\nIndustrial Solution Services, Inc. policy is to conduct all operations in a safe and conscientious manner to prevent accidental release of any hazardous material, including substances regulated through the California Accidental Release Prevention Program and Federal EPA's Risk Management Plan, i.e., aqueous ammonia.  Industrial Solution Services, Inc. trains its employees to properly handle and store hazardous materials, to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting its worker's health, the workplace, the public, and the environment.  Industrial Solution Services, Inc.'s Accidental Release Prevention policy is implemented through the management system contained in its RMP.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nThe Aqueous Ammonia Production System at Industrial Solution Services, Inc. is comprised of three ammonia storage tanks, one aqua converter, a vent scrubber, control units and piping.  The Aqueous Ammonia Production System produces 19 wt. % and 29.4 wt. % aqueous ammonia for sale to client facilities.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nIndustrial Solution Services, Inc. has an RMP program in place to manage the handling of ammonia.  The program includes requirements for written operating procedures, personnel training, equipment maintenance, incident investigation, process hazard analysis, management of change and periodic review or audit of program elements.
