The RMP established three levels of requirements for the program.  Programs 1 and 2 are for facilities that pose less risk to the environment and therefore have reduced compliance requirements.  Program 1 is designed for \"no impact\" facilities and has the fewest requirements, while Program 3 is the most stringent of the three levels.\n\nThe program level for each facility is determined by:\n       Use of regulated substances in threshold quantity\n       Impact of an off-site public receptor (e.g., residence, school, park)\n       North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code\n       Five-year accident history\n       OHSA PSM (29 CFR 1910.119) applicability. \n\nDelta Terminal Services is regulated under Program 2 requirements under 40 CFR 68.10 because:\n       The facility stores toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate and chloroform in excess of the threshold quantities.\n       A release from this facility could impact an offsite public Receptor (residence).\n       The facility does not operate under a NAICS code specified in the rule and it is not subject to OSHA PSM because PSM does not apply to flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks which are kept below their normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration [29 CFR 1926.64(a)(1)(ii)(B)].).\n\n40 CFR Part 68 Subpart G applies to an owner or operator of a stationary source that has more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process, as determined under 40 CFR 68.115, Delta Terminal Services stores more than the threshold quantity of toluene 2, 4-diisocyanate (10,000 pounds) and chloroform (20,000 pounds).\n\nTherefore, Delta Terminal Services is required to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Employees involved in operating the TDI and chloroform activities are thoroughly trained to identify and understand the hazards posed by this the transfer process.  Process safety and emergency response materials are kept on site and periodically reviewed.  Materials include information pertaining to the hazards of TDI and chloroform, process technology, process equipment, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThe stationary sources are TDI and chloroform storage tanks and related appurtenances.  The largest TDI process group (e.g., largest storage tank or group of interconnected tanks) has a storage capacity of 1,470,000 gallons (14,949,900 pounds).  \nThe total TDI stationary storage capacity is 82,000,000 pounds.  The facility also has 1,400,000 gallons (18,900,000 pounds) of chloroform in a single tank.  The total chloroform stationary storage capacity is 18,900,000 pounds.\n\nHowever, in addition to stationary sources (tanks) approximately 20 TDI railcars can be present onsite, 5,756 TDI Drums, 1 Chloroform tanktruck and 80 Chloroform Drums.\n  \nThe total inventory quantity of 20 TDI railcars is 3,228,383 pounds and 5,766 TDI drums is 3,328,383 pounds for a grand total of 6,556,766 pounds.\n\nThe total inventory for 1 chloroform tanktruck is 41,217 pounds and 80 chloroform drums or 54,956 pounds for a grand total of 96,173 pounds. \n\nThe facility is required to complete one worst-case release scenario per hazardous substance handled [68.165(a)(2)] to determine program applicability.
