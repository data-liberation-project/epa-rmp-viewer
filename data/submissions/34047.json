Appropriate responses to releases of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are documented in Section 7 (Emergency Response) of the Risk Management Program document.  Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs are fully implemented and coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts.\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nVitafoam is a flexible polyurethane foam manufacturing facility located in Tupelo, Mississippi.  As a result of the manufacturing process, the regulated chemical TDI is present at the facility at greater than 10,000 pounds.  The facility has one covered process that requires the facility to meet Program 2 requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations.\n\nTDI is delivered to the facility via railcars and offloaded into storage tanks.  In the process, TDI is used in the production of polyurethane foam.  The facility manufactures polyurethane foam by the vigorous mechanical mixing of polyols with TDI along with water, catalyst, and surfactants.  The resultant polymetric network is expanded with carbon dioxide which is formed in the reaction between the water and TDI.\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nProcess Safety Information \u00bf Up-to-date process safety information is maintained for use by employees operating the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.48, including the following:\n\u00bfThe MSDS for TDI that contains toxicity information, permissible exposure limits, physical data, reactivity data, thermal and chemical stability data and synergistic effects from mixing process flows.\n\u00bfBlock flow diagrams for the covered pr"

The hazard review was performed using What-If/Checklists.  The hazard review identified the hazards associated with the regulated TDI process; causes of potential accidental release scenarios; safeguards used to prevent accidental releases; and methods used to detect, monitor or control accidental releases.  Any issues identified during the PHA were documented and will be resolved in a timely manner.  The hazard review will be revalidated and updated once every five years following the completion of the initial hazard review.\n\nOperating Procedures \u00bf Detailed and up-to-date process operating procedures have been developed and are maintained for the covered process in accordance with 40 CFR 68.52.  Operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involving the covered process in a manner consistent with process safety information and are readily accessible to employees involved in the covered process.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain current and accurate.  Operating procedures cover each operating phase of the covered process including initial system startup, normal operation, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and conditions when required, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup following a turnaround or emergency shutdown."

The training includes an overview of the process and emphasizes process operating procedures, safe work practices, health and safety hazards, and emergency operations including shutdown.  Those employees already involved in operating or maintaining a covered process prior to June 21, 1999, have been certified in writing as having \u00bfthe required knowledge, skills, and abilities to safely carry out the duties and responsibilities as specified in the operating procedures.\u00bf  Refresher training is provided, at minimum, every three (3) years to all employees involved in working with the covered process.  Documentation is maintained for each employee to ensure that he or she received and understood the required training.\n\nMechanical Integrity \u00bf A maintenance program has been developed in accordance with 40 CFR 68.73 for covered process equipment.  Employees involved with the maintenance of covered process receive additional training, which includes an overview of the process, its hazards, and applicable procedures to ensure that the employees can perform the job in a safe manner.

Any equipment deficiencies identified during maintenance, inspection or testing are corrected in a safe and timely manner.

These procedures assure that appropriate considerations are addressed prior to any change.  Employees involved in operating a process and maintenance and contract employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process are informed of, and trained in, the change prior to startup of the process or affected part of the process.  If a change results in a change in the process safety information, such information is updated accordingly.  If a change in the process results in a change in the operating procedures or practices, such procedures or practices will be updated accordingly.\n\nPre-startup Review \u00bf Vitafoam performs a pre-startup review according to 40 CFR 68.77 when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.\n\nCompliance Audits \u00bf RMP compliance is confirmed through safety audits that are performed at least once every three (3) years in accordance with 40 CFR 68.58.

The incident investigation procedure is initiated as soon as possible and no later than forty-eight (48) hours following any incident.  A team is established to perform the incident investigation and always includes at least one person knowledgeable in the process, a contract employee if the incident involves work by a contractor, and other persons with appropriate qualifications to investigate an accident.  Following the investigation, a written report is prepared summarizing the following information, at a minimum:  date of the incident; date the investigation began; description of the incident and any contributing factors; and any recommendations resulting from the investigation.  When completed, all affected personnel including the contract employees review the report.

The ER Plan procedures are reviewed and updated, as appropriate, to reflect changes at Vitafoam and ensure that employees are informed of changes.\n\n(f) Planned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nIn an effort to improve safety and to reduce the risk of accidental releases, changes to the RMP and the facility have been implemented.  These improvements were identified either as a risk reduction measure during the hazard review or as a result of an improved RMP and the dedication to an inherently safer process."
