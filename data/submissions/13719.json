Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide UCAR Emulsion Systems Garland Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\n2. Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide UES Garland Plant is a manufacturing facility that produces synthetic latex  polymer products, which are sold to customers that convert them into finished products such as latex paint, caulk and adhesives.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the UES Garland Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.  The Union Carbide UES Garland Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances at levels above threshold quantities: \n\n7 Acrylonitrile (2-Propenenitrile)\n7 Vinyl Acetate Monomer (Acetic acid ethenyl ester)\n\nThe Garland plant has no RMP-regulated flammable substances.\n\n3. Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-si"

Chemical-specific steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, are shown immediately after the scenario description.  The plant's general accident prevention program is described in Section 4.\n\n\n\n\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario \n\nAcrylonitrile:  This scenario assumes storage tank failure, releasing 67,600 pounds of acrylonitrile as a liquid to the spill containment basin.  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limit the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 84 percent ( 56,784 pounds). According to EPAs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following administrative control and passive mitigation are used in this analysis:\n\n7 Inventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 84 percent (56,784 pounds). \n7 Secondary Containment:  The tank is located in above ground, concrete secondary containment. The containment consist of poured, steel reinforced concrete floor with pour, steel reinforced concrete walls. Cast in place were the walls meet the floor slab is a rubber water stop to prevent lateral leakage of a released compound. The containment is large enough to hold the contents of the acrylonitrile tank.\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Tank Construction:  The tank is constructed of material that is not degraded by the stored material or the crushed rock located on the tank exterior.\n7 Mounded Tanks:  The limestone covered tanks inhibit the spread of vapors and the pH of the limestone prevents any tendency for corrosion of the tank..\n7 Hydrocarbon Detectors: This system is designed to continuously detect the presence of hydrocarbons from a storage tank and sound an "

It is actuated by the emergency shutdown system or manual pull.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nVinyl Acetate:  This scenario assumes a drain valve is open on the transfer pump moving vinyl acetate to a process preparation tank. The >\" drain valve releases 10,700 lb. of acrylonitrile over 25 minutes into a containment basin. This senerio leads to a 10,700 pound realease of acrylonitrile in 25 minutes, the time it would take to complete the entire transfer from the storage tank to the intermidiate mix tank.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following passive and active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n7 Emergency Shutdown System:  A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the pumps and put the transfer valves in a fail-safe position. This scenario assumes that the operator detects the release and actuates the emergency shutdown system within 25 minutes. \n7 Secondary Containment:  The tank is located inside a concrete dike which is designed to contain any leaks from the tank and to limit evaporation.\n7 Surveillance: Operators and maintenance employees monitor the work area while working on the pump.
