The facility has four ammonia refrigeration systems that provides refrigeration capacity to the following:\n\n\n\nProcess 5\n\n(1) Wine Chiller\n\n\n\nProcess 6\n\n(2) Wine Chillers\n\n\n\nProcess 7\n\n(2) Wine Chillers\n\n\n\nProcess 8\n\n(1) Wine Chiller\n\n(28) Storage Tanks\n\n\n\nThe wine chillers are equipped with shell & tube heat exchangers and accumulators as required for flooded operation. The storage tanks are supplied by a liquid recirculator as required for a pumped overfeed system.\n\nThe refrigeration machinery is contained within each outdoor machinery area. A partial list of system components includes:\n\n\n\nP5 Machinery Area\n\n(2) Reciprocating compressors\n\n(2) Oil separators\n\n(1) Shell and tube wine chiller\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n\n\nP6 Machinery Area\n\n(1) Screw compressor\n\n(1) Oil separator\n\n(2) Shell and tube wine chillers\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n(1) Diffusion tank (all processes are piped to this diffusion tank)\n\n\n\nP7 Machinery Area\n\n(2) Reciprocating compressors\n\n(2) Oil separators\n\n(2) Shell and tube wine chillers\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n\n\nP8 Machinery Area\n\n(2) Screw compressors\n\n(2) Oil separators\n\n(1) Shell and tube wine chiller\n\n(1) High pressure receiver\n\n(1) Evaporative condenser\n\n(1) Liquid recirculator\n\n(1) Oil pot\n\n(28) Storage tanks\n\n(1) Diffusion tank (all processes are piped to this diffusion tank)\n\n\n\nProcesses 5 thru 8 flooded system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from each hig"

      "SummaryText": "h pressure receiver is piped to each heat exchanger where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the heat exchanger.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line. The suction line returns the vapor to the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to each high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nProcess 8 pumped overfeed system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped through a series of liquid feed solenoid valves, an expansion valve, and into a liquid recirculator.  From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each storage tank, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the storage tank.  As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature and pressure gas which passes through an isolation valve and is returned to the liquid recirculator. \n\n\n\nThe residual liquid is separated from the gas in the recirculator and the gas is piped to the suction inlet on the compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure gas ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receiver.\n\n\n\nEach system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and pressure relief valves which vent to the ammonia diffusion tank if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point. \n\n\n\nAn emergency control box is installed in Process 8 in the outdoor machinery "

The connecting pipe between the high and low side has one equalizer valve that would equalize the system.\n\n\n\nEach ammonia refrigeration system at ASV Wines consists of vessels, equipment, and valve which are interconnected by piping. The systems are located in close proximity to each other and share an ammonia diffusion tank. It is believed that a leak from one system would impact the ability to operate another. Therefore, the ammonia refrigeration systems are treated as a single process.\n\n\n\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\n1.3.1 General \n\n\n\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n\n\nASV Wines - Pond has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter. \n\n\n\n1.3.2 Anhydrous Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the ASV Wines - Pond facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\n\n\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechan"
