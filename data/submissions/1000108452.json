(Honda) Anna, Ohio Engine Plant (AEP).\n\n<> The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are addressed in the individual RMP procedures which detail the RMP requirements as well as how Honda complies with the applicable requirements. In addition, Honda has developed and implemented two policies which directly impact and influence Honda's accident release prevention and emergency response activities. First, Honda's Safety Policy expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n -Provide a safe and healthful working environment,\n -Conduct its operations with the highest regard for associate safety, \n -Continually improve the safety management system, \n -Train associates in respects to safety related to their job, and\n -Comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and standards mandated by federal, state and local law. \n\nSecond, Honda has developed and implemented an Environmental Policy which expresses Honda's commitment to:\n\n -Comply with all applicable environmental requirements mandated by federal, state, and local law,\n -Operate and continually improve an environmental management system, and\n -Implement methods to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources and reduce waste.\n\nWith these policies as a foundation, Honda AEP has made a significant effort to ensure compliance and good management in all areas relating to chemical safety. Many of the RMP requirements are similar or identical to requirements covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, and the Honda proc"

The Honda AEP uses one chemical that is subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The RMP-regulated substances (anhydrous ammonia) are used in the heat-treating (nitriding) furnace of the Ferrous Manufacturing Department to chemically harden the surface of the crankshafts.\n\n-Anhydrous Ammonia Process:\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia (metallurgical grade) is delivered to the site via tank wagons and stored in an onsite tank, limited per American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Compressed Gas Association (CGA) G-2.1 Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, to allow for sufficient vapor space in the tank. The nitriding process uses ammonia vapor, which is supplied from the headspace of the tank. If additional vapor is needed, ammonia is passed through a series of immersion heaters (vaporizers) where the liquid is vaporized into a gas. Through overhead piping, the ammonia vapor travels through a shutoff header stand and a flow meter stand prior to being introduced into each nitriding furnace. Due to the high operating temperature (1,110 degrees Fahrenheit), the ammonia dissociates into its components according to the following reaction:\n\n2 Anhydrous Ammonia -> 2 Nitrogen + 3 Hydrogen\n\nThe nitrogen combines with the alloying elements in the steel to form nitrides. The nitrides form at the steel surface as a hard chemical layer which will minimize wear and fatigue. The remaining component, hy"

The Honda AEP has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations. The required elements of the RMP prevention program are listed below:\n\n -Employee Participation\n -Process Safety Information\n -Process Hazard Analysis\n -Operating Procedures\n -Training\n -Contractors\n -Pre-startup Safety Review\n -Mechanical Integrity\n -Hot Work Permit\n -Management of Change\n -Incident Investigation\n -Compliance Audits\n\nIn addition, the facility meets the requirements of the RMP Emergency Planning and Response element as detailed below. These items, their specific requirements, and how Honda AEP complies with the requirements are addressed in the individual procedural documents.\n\nIn addition to being subject to the RMP requirements, the anhydrous ammonia process at Honda AEP is subject to and complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Honda AEP has implemented the PSM standard, including response training, mechanical integrity and chemical monitoring devices to maintain high levels of compliance and prevent accidental releases. Monitoring systems have built in backup systems to ensure fail-safe operation/detection and therefore are highly reliable. The plant has appropriate material/equipment to control or stabilize process leaks and releases. The AEP emergency response team conducts annual training regarding chemical specific response scenarios and maintains chemical specific response equipment. As a result, no significant accidental releases have occurred over the life of the various processes regulated by the PSM standard.\n\n<> The five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nHonda AEP has had zero RMP reportable incidents in the previous five years."

This plan describes the responsibility and procedures of Honda personnel and establishes a system in which the members of each plant's emergency response team work with local emergency response organizations. This company-wide plan also serves as a model upon which the Honda/AEP emergency response team has based its own Honda AEP-specific ERP. The Honda AEP plan outlines how the Honda AEP emergency response team is to work closely with the Anna Fire Department, the Shelby County Hazmat Team, and the Emergency Management Agency to promptly respond to any emergency.\n\nIn the event of an incident, Honda AEP has systems to respond quickly. Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis. Spills or leaks can be detected and reported quickly, allowing for rapid implementation of the necessary steps of the Honda AEP ERP. \n\nThe Honda AEP Emergency Response Team (ERT) meets annually with the Village of Anna Fire Chief and Members of its response team to review operations at the plant. The Honda AEP Emergency Response Team targets to have 12 to 15 associates on each of the three production shifts. The members are volunteers who work full-time in their respective production departments. There are 3 full-time emergency response staff members, one for each shift, with one (on a rotating basis) on call 24 hours a day, who are responsible for leadership and coordination of team members. Each emergency response team member must meet Fire Fighter Level I state requirements as defined in Section 1001 of the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) manual and must attend quarterly training classes and drills.

The response team will be activated and respond using procedures identified in the response plan. Outside agencies are activated by plant security by dialing 911 in the event that the response team requests their assistance or if the response team is not available to respond at full strength. Public notification of a release will be handled jointly by the Shelby County LEPC and Sheriff's Office.
