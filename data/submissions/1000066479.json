      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n- Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nCountry Oven Bakery is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible accidental releases of regulated substances. However, if such an accidental release does occur, we are coordinated with the Bowling Green Fire Department and the Warren County Local Emergency Planning Committee for emergency response support.\n\n\n\n\n\n- The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nPresently Anhydrous Ammonia is the only RMP regulated substance present at this facility above a threshold quantity.  Ammonia is utilized as the primary cooling media in our closed-loop refrigeration system. The system's purpose is to provide refrigeration and cold storage capabilities for Country Oven Bakery processing operations.  Due to the size and characteristics of our ammonia refrigeration system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, Country Oven Bakery is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n- Offsite Consequence Analysis \n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario have been completed as stated in Section 2 and 3 of the RMP Submit text.\n\n\n\nTo evaluate both the worst case and alternative release scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp Hazardous Release software was utilized exclusively. The RMP Comp models are referenced in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as an acceptable model for the release scenario mathematical approximation process.\n\n\n\nAs specified in the RMP Guidance, the worst case and alternate case "

      "SummaryText": "release scenarios have been calculated and the results of the calculations are documented in the Country Oven Bakery RMP Plan on file with the Plant Engineer at the facility.  Public and environmental receptors that could possibly be affected by the release scenarios were determined through the use of MARPLOT mapping system software and US Census Bureau 2010 data. \n\n\n\n- The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nCountry Oven Bakery has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68.  To meet these necessary requirements Country Oven Bakery has implemented their Process Safety Management program through the written guidelines stated in the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\n- Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no ammonia related incidents at the Country Oven Bakery facility within the last five years that have resulted in on, or off site property damage, injuries or deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Emergency Action and Response Plan\n\n\n\nCountry Oven Bakery current Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation/shelter-in-place of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency.   Country Oven Bakery also maintains an Emergency Response Plan.  Personnel have the ability to respond to minor and major ammonia releases or spills, and have received HAZWOPER training. In the event that an ammonia release or spill does occur that is outside the capabilities of the trained refrigeration technicians to mitigate safely, off-site responders will be notified, specifically the Bowling Green Fire Department and the Warren County LEPC.  At that point, Country Oven Bakery's emergency response team will respond in coordination with the off-site responders. \n\n\n\nThe plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within the facility that would require modified procedures.\n\n\n\n- Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\n\n\nCountry Oven Bakery currently has no change"

However, the process will be subjected to periodic process hazard analysis reviews for the purpose of identifying potential hazards and implementing the necessary improvement to provide a safer system. Country Oven Bakery personnel will also periodically review all potential opportunities to improve the safety of our personnel, the surrounding community, and the ammonia refrigeration process."
