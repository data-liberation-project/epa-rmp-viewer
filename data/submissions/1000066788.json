This Risk Management \n\n\n\nCalifornia Dairies, Inc. Visalia prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program, are codified in the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735.1,\n\net. Seq. \n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances to comply. The regulations are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68. Finally, both the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Association (CalOSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM regulations, as defined in CCR Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively.\n\n\n\nSCOPE\n\nThe EPA RMP regulation requires that an Executive Summary be provided as part of the registration submitted to the EPA. The following areas are addressed in this summary:\n\n\n\n? Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n? Stationary Source Activities and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n? Worst-Case and Alternative-Case Release Scenarios\n\n? Prevention Program\n\n? Five-Year Accident History\n\n? Emergency Response Program\n\n? Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCalifornia Dairies is committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program.

The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis)Report.\n\n\n\nReporting and Action: Federal regulations require reporting when there is a release of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds in 24 hours.  State regulations require reporting when there is a  substantial accidental release of ammonia or a threat of accidental release of ammonia. California Dairies interprets this regulation at any release that poses a threat of injury above and beyond minor irritation to anyone.\n\n\n\nAll releases and near misses are to be recorded using the incident investigation forms. All releases are to be monitored and all readings recorded. All releases and near misses are to be reviewed to develop or correct procedures that may prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED  \n\nThe California Dairies facility provides production, product cooling, and short-term storage of dairy products.  The facility is located in an industrial area of Tulare County on a contiguous property. Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in the Main Plant Refrigeration System. The total ammonia inventory in the Main Plant system exceeds the Federal and State thresholds.\n\n\n\nThe refrigeration system is a combination of a direct, closed loop, and secondary coolant mechanical refrigeration system. The original process was built in 2007. The ammonia equipment is located outside, in a machinery room and in a cooler/freezer.\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe. As this system has interconnected piping and since the largest vessel can hold the complete charge the total system charge was used for the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider t"

In addition the Main Plant System is separated by walls and distance. Furthermore as the refrigerant escapes pressure will decrease reducing the release rate. The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.  The regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\n\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nCalifornia Dairies Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM (CalARP) Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by California Dairies is essential to help prevent or minimize the effects if a release occurs.\n\n\n\nKey objectives of California Dairies Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1) Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information. (Addressed under the Process Safety Information Element)\n\n\n\n2) Provide thorough team evaluation of the refrigeration system. The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by California Dairies. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis and Mechanical Integrity Elements).\n\n\n\n3) Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation Elements.)\n\n\n\n4) Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system.

First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.).  This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-today activities.\n\n\n\nSecond, all California Dairies employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under the Employee Participation Element)\n\n\n\n6) Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by California Dairies Management of Change Procedure.\n\n\n\nIf a mechanical change is required and for maintenance contracts, California Dairies has a procedure for selecting a contractor based on the company's experience and safety history. Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other \"Hot Work\" occurs close to the refrigeration system, a California Dairies Hot Work permit is required.  The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire.  Following completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review Elements.)\n\n\n\n7) Verification of California Dairies compliance with the RMP/PSM program.

Responders are trained to enter an IDLH condition. Responders are also trained to the (300 PPM) Air Purifying Respirator level. Responders will assist outside agencies during larger releases.\n\n\n\nDetailed plans (emergency action plans) have been developed to assist responding facility personnel. All areas (zones) inside the building can be brought under control within 20 minutes of any ammonia emergency or breakdown if personnel are on site. Small releases can be brought under control immediately.\n\n\n\nThe emergency release response plan for all releases is to gain access to the shutdown valves and switches/controls for the component or area with the release. If the system shut down areas are within the ammonia release area the entire ammonia system may be shut down if appropriate. The appropriate shut down switches are identified.\n\n\n\nThe Federal and California Emergency Planning Regulations considered in this program include:\n\n_EPA's Risk Management Plan\n\n_OSHA's Emergency Action Plan\n\n_OSHA's Process Safety Standard\n\n_EPA's Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know\n\n_Contingency Plan\n\n_Hazardous Materials Plan (HMBP)\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nEmployees, community safety, the environment and product care are primary concerns at this facility.
