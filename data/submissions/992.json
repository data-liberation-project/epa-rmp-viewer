Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Farmers Union Oil Company Valley City Litchville - Peak Ammonia Plant (Peak Ammonia\nPlant) east of Valley City are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. \nThis commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program\nthat covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee\ntraining associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate\ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, our\ntrained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. \nWe also coordinate our response efforts with the Barnes County Emergency Management Agency,\nwhich provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in a 30,000-gallon tank at our Peak Location facility east of Valley City (Figure 1). \nThe maximum amount stored is 24,000 gallons (123,504 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of\n80%.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (123,504 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the EPA's accidental release prevention\nrequirements as set forth in 40 CFR part 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements\nof the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nPeak Ammonia Plant maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes (Appendix E).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are\nidentified and controlled effectively.  Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nPeak Ammonia Plant maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our\ncovered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n(Appendix B).\n\nTraining\nPeak Ammonia Plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who\nare operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes\n(Appendix C).\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPeak Am"

Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training\nin maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix D).\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Peak Ammonia Plant to manage changes in process chemicals,\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPeak Ammonia Plant routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\nequipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nPeak Ammonia Plant conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\nprovisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\nEmployee Participation\nPeak Ammonia Plant truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a\nteam effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning\naccident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access\nto all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly\ninformation resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n  5.
