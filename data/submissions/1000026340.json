      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\r\nThe MillerCoors LLC-Shenandoah Brewery operates a brewing, packaging and distributing operation near Elkton, Virginia.  The facility uses anhydrous ammonia for the refrigeration process throughout the facility.  Use of this chemical is regulated under the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), Section 112(r), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management (RM) Planning regulations (40 CFR, Part 68) herein referred to as the RM regulations.  Under the CAAA and the RM regulations, the facility is considered to be one stationary source.  \r\n\r\nThis document addresses the five EPA regulatory requirements for a RM Plan which form the basis of the RM program for the MillerCoors Shenandoah facility.  EPA's key regulatory requirements for an RM program are:\r\n\r\n1) Management Plan\r\n2) Hazard Assessment\r\n3) Accident History\r\n4) Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n5) Emergency Response\r\n6) Risk Management (RM) Plan and Data Elements\r\n\r\nThis RM plan is based on the requirements listed above and is organized to reflect them in five sections, as summarized below.\r\n\r\nRequirement 1.  Management Plan\r\nAt the Shenandoah Brewery, the PSM Coordinator representative is a member of the Asset Care (Maintenance Planner) for the Utilities Department. The RM Program Manager is a member of the EHS Department. Both representatives are responsible for the accident release prevention program for the ammonia refrigeration processes.  Utilities manager, maintenance staff, operators/techs, engineers and staff level personnel also execute component activities to maintain compliance with RM regulations.  \r\n\r\nRequirement 2.  Hazard Assessment\r\nPotential accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia were modeled to evaluate possible offsite impacts. Modeling procedures followed EPA guidance to identify worst case (WCS) and alternate case release scenarios (ACS) as defined by the RM regulations.  EPA personnel concur that assumptions"

      "SummaryText": "used for WCS are not realistic and in some cases are not physically possible.  However, EPA guidance was followed and endpoints were identified.  The WCS's were identified by comparing the results for each process and selecting the scenario that resulted in the greatest distance to the endpoint.  For each scenario the number of permanent offsite residents located inside a circle (centered on the release point with a radius equal to the endpoint) was then estimated using EPA's LandView 6 software. This software is an approved EPA source of population data. The offsite population estimates reflected in the RMP do not include the MillerCoors employees at the Shenandoah facility.  As stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25, the WCS's and ACS's were calculated for the Shenandoah covered processes and the results of those calculations are held on file at the Shenandoah facility. \r\n\r\nTo develop more realistic, although conservative, estimates of offsite impacts, as required by RM regulations, several ACS's were also evaluated for the ammonia systems.   \r\n\r\nRequirement 3.  Accident History\r\nIn the past five years, none of the processes subject to RM regulations have had releases that have resulted in offsite property damage or offsite health consequences requiring medical treatment for chemical releases or fire. On site releases have been reported to regulatory agencies as required.\r\n\r\nRequirement 4.  Prevention Program\r\nThe MillerCoors Shenandoah Brewery has prevention program for the ammonia process was developed to comply with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29CFR 1910.119) and have been in place since 1993.  The 12 key provisions of the release prevention program for the ammonia process for which EPA requires Program 3 prevention programs to have, are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Employee Participation\r\n- Process Safety Information\r\n- Process Hazard Analysis\r\n- Operating Procedures\r\n- Contractors\r\n- Pre-Star"

Emergency Response \r\nThe emergency response program at the facility consists of personnel trained to recognize releases and immediately notify Security by telephone.  An Alarm System (Simplex) monitors all ammonia system areas and ammonia releases. The alarms report directly into the Security Front Gate station. All Security personnel are trained in Emergency Response to the Incident Commander level and respond to all ammonia release incidents. If external emergency responders are needed,  MillerCoors security will contact the McGaheysville Fire Department which is located within three miles of the facility and is the Authority Having Justification(AHJ).  Additional external emergency response resources to the scene could include the Rockingham County Hazmat Team, Virginia State Police and other agencies, as needed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nRequirement 6.  RM Plan and Data Elements\r\nThe specific data elements required to be electronically reported to EPA are included in this submittal.  The data elements are supported by an RM plan which documents and provides additional detail for the RM regulatory requirement."
