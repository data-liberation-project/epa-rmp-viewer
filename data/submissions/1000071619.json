The Bay City Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Bay City, MI. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, No. 2 fuel oil, butane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\r\n\r\nMPLX - Bay City Terminal in Bay City, MI is committed to operating and maintaining  processes in a safe, reliable and environmentally sound manner. Marathon believes that excellent performance in health, safety, and the environment goes hand in hand with operating reliably, and that outstanding HES performance is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThe Bay City Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the environment, as well as the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community. Marathon promotes health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that Marathon has designed and implemented, including:\r\n\r\nA. A description of the facility and the use of regulated substances;\r\nB. An overview of the accidental release prevention programs;\r\nC. A five-year accident history for accidental releases of reulated chemicals;\r\nD. An overview of the emergency response program; and\r\nE. An overview of planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe primary function of the Bay City Terminal, located in Bay City, Michigan is to act as a refined petroleum distribution facility. The butane blending process has been classified as Program level 3."

By virtue of the flammable effects associated with butane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling butane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community. MPLX - Bay City Terminal is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health. Safety at the Facility depends upon the manner in which butane is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process. Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees, which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the Bay City Terminal.\r\n\r\nThe facility has fixed inventories of butane. Butane is received by truck (transports) and stored in one (1) 90,000-gallon storage vessel. Specifically, liquefied butane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure. The butane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack. Injection quantities are controlled via the blending skid and Bartec-Benke Analyzer. Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250 degrees fahrenheit) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shutoff on the vessel, emergency shut-off devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/interlock devices. Access to the Bay City Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel and authorized contractors/visitors.\r\n\r\nB.

Marathon and its employees are committed to the standards required by these management programs. In addition to the above elements, the Terminal also has specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of a release. These are briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nGeneral Risk Reduction and Safety Measures\r\n\r\n-Engineering and construction in accordance with recognized industry and company standards;\r\n-Equipment properly designed with protection from overpressure (pressure safety relief valves, etc.);\r\n-Updated technical drawings, Piping & Instrument Diagrams and Process Flow Diagrams;\r\n-Operating systems monitored and controlled by trained Operators;\r\n-Computerized monitoring and control of process operation;\r\n-Redundant control systems with battery back-ups;\r\n-Automatic and manual shutdown devices for critical systems;\r\n-Scheduled inspection and testing of instruments, analyzers, and safety devices;\r\n-Limited facility access;\r\n-Regular safety meetings and safety awareness programs;\r\n-Routinely scheduled safety inspections and audits; and\r\n-F"
