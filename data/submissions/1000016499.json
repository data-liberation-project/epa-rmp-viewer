      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP) are committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that such a release does occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also completely coordinated with the Montgomery County Local Emergency Response Committee that provides additional emergency response expertise. RFAAP has been in operation since 1941. During that 70-year period, there have been no releases that are either in the \"alternate\" or the \"worst-case\" category described in this plan.\n\nThe Regulated Substances and Applicability\nRFAAP has more than the threshold planning quantity of four regulated substances and is therefore subject to the requirements of 40 CFR 68. The RFAAP primary activities are Chemical and Propellant Manufacturing (NAICS Codes 325188 - Basic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing and 32592 - Explosives Manufacturing.). The four substances stored at RFAAP that are subject to the provisions of 40 CFR 68 are Nitric acid (CAS No. 7697-37-2), Ethyl ether (60-29-7), Ammonia (7664-41-7) and Oleum (8014-95-7).  \n\nSince the last update of this RMP plan, RFAAP has made the following changes at its processes subject to RMP requirements:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tEither or both of two 51,000 gallon tanks in the Purchased Acid Storage area may be used to store oleum\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe TNT Manufacturing Acid Storage area no longer stores strong nitric acid or oleum at volumes subject to RMP requirements\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAny or all of six 51,000 gallon tanks in the Manufactured Acid Storage are"

The RMP plan has been revised to address the maximum possible inventory of ether stored on-site during an interim period when the new ether storage tanks are placed in service prior to removing any or all of the existing ether storage tanks from ether service.\n\nThe Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nEPA's General Guidance for Risk Management Programs includes the following statement concerning worst-case release assumptions. \n\nThe distance to the endpoint estimated under worst-case conditions should not be considered a zone in which the public would likely be in danger; instead, it is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected in the unlikely event of catastrophic conditions. Distances greater than about 10 kilometers are particularly uncertain. EPA intends the estimated distances to provide a basis for a discussion among the regulated community, emergency responders, and the public, rather than a basis for any specific actions. \n\nRFAAP followed EPA guidance in developing the following worst-case release scenarios.  \n\nWorst-Case Release Scenarios\n\nRFAAP evaluated a total of nine worst-case release scenarios.  Worst-case release scenarios represent highly unlikely events occurring during the worst meteorological conditions, which are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an atmospheric stability class of F. For toxic substances EPA requires the evaluation of a catastrophic release of the entire contents from the largest vessel.  For flammable substances the EPA prescribed worst-case release scenario assumes that the total quantity of the flammable substance is released forming a vapor cloud that detonates.  As a conservative assumption, 10 percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion."

The following provide details of the chosen worst-case release scenarios.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario from the Ammonia Oxidation Plant involves a catastrophic release of 143,400 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dikes are taken into account for the evaluation of this scenario. However, other safety features including active engineering controls and emergency response are not considered.  Under worst-case meteorological conditions, modeling determined that this worst-case release scenario would have an off site impact and is therefore subject to the provisions of Program 3.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario of from the Manufactured Acid Storage Area involves the catastrophic release of 525,000 pounds of strong Nitric Acid. Passive mitigation (secondary containment) was considered in this scenario, however, active mitigation, such as the response of area personnel was not considered. Under worst-case meteorological conditions, modeling determined that this worst-case release scenario would have an off site impact and is therefore subject to the provisions of Program 3.\n\nPurchased Acid Storage was evaluated under EPA's worst-case release assumptions and found to have no impact on public receptors.  Therefore, this process qualifies as a Program 1 process.  The worst-case scenario for this process involves the release of 760,000 lb. of 20% Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid).

To evaluate the alternate release scenarios, we have used the reference tables in the EPA document Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis or RMP*Comp.\n\nThe alternative release scenario from the Manufactured Acid Storage Area involves the release of 524,000 lbs. of strong nitric acid into a dike, which is drained into the waste acid treatment system by operators within 30 minutes of the release.  Under neutral weather conditions, modeling determined that the maximum distance to the endpoint would impact the nearest public receptor, which is the staff village located on the RFAAP property.\n\nTwo alternative release scenario for Ammonia were evaluated.  One involves a release from a rail car located at the Ammonia Storage Facility in the Ammonia Oxidation Process.  The scenario involves the release of 80,000 lb. of Ammonia in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  It is assumed that operators are notified on the release by the existing Ammonia detection system.  The other involves the release from a rupture of one of the five ammonia tanks after the active mitigation of the ammonia release by the water curtain reduces the release by 70%.

A number of processes at the facility are subject to the OSHA process safety management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  RFAAP is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nRFAAP maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nRFAAP conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with each process are identified and controlled.  RFAAP uses several methodologies to complete process hazards assessments (PHA). The PHAs conducted for the covered processes at RFAAP were performed using either a \"What If\" analysis or Fault Tree Analysis. These studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a minimum of every five years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities, RFAAP has an extensive procedure development and implementation program. An excellent feature that is included in each operating procedure gives the operator the right to refuse to start-up any process at the facility if he does not feel that it is safe.

These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nEach employee involved in the operation of any process is trained using the procedures described in Section 14. All training includes an emphasis on the specific safety and health hazards associated with equipment and chemicals, emergency operations, and safe work practices. Each operator receives initial training, which involves the reading of the procedure and a walk through of the process operations with the procedure in hand. Competence in the procedures is determined based on observation by the operator's supervisor. Every time the procedure is changed each operator must be retrained using the same methods as described for initial training.  If there are no changes to the procedure, each operator is re-trained in the procedure annually.  For each employee at RFAAP a record is kept of that employee's required training, the dates of the last training, and when the employee's refresher training is required.  All training records are maintained in the individual operating areas.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nRFAAP carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.

Each MOC document whether it is to perform a process or procedural change contains at a minimum the following information:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tThe technical basis for the proposed change\n\u00c2\u00bf\tImpact of the change to safety and health\n\u00c2\u00bf\tModifications to operating procedures\n\u00c2\u00bf\tNecessary time period for the change\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAuthorization requirements for the proposed change\n\nIf the MOC system results in a major change to one of the covered processes the RMP will be updated and resubmitted as appropriate.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nThe RFAAP Plant Process Control Board (PPCB) conducts pre-start up reviews before the process is allowed to operate. Representatives from Safety, Hazards, Environmental, and Operations attend the pre-startup evaluation to determine if there are any problems that must be addressed prior to the process being allowed to start. If there are deficiencies identified by the PPCB, the process must correct the deficiencies before the process may start up.\n\nCompliance Audits\nRFAAP conducts RMP compliance audits at least every 3 years.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAll incident investigations at RFAAP are conducted in accordance with written procedures, which are located on the RFAAP computer network, accessible to all employees. The objective of the incident investigation is to obtain the necessary information to prevent the incident/accident from occurring again. RFAAP promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release fr"

All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nRFAAP truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  RFAAP employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  RFAAP requires that operators participate in investigations, PHAs, etc.  RFAAP reminds employees through email reminders and safety meeting communications.  For purposes of assigning the most recent data for employee participation, RFAAP designates the final day of the ATK fiscal year as the date of these recurring employee participation awareness activities.\n\nContractors\nAll contractors prior to performing any work are required to read, and certify that they understand and will abide by the rules identified in the \"Safety Rules for Contractors and Subcontractors\".  The booklet describes general safety procedures such as ladder use and facility specific procedures such as what to do when encountering a vehicle that is transporting propellants or explosives.  A copy of this booklet is given to each individual performing contract or subcontract work on plant.  \n\nFive-year Accident History\nRFAAP has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases.  Due to the excellent facilities and administrative controls, in the last five years, RFAAP has not had an accidental release that resulted in on site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  In fact, in the 70 years that Hercules Incorporated or ATK have operated the RFAAP, there has never been a release equal to the seven worst-case or the three alternate release scenarios evaluated in this plan.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nRFAAP maintains a Disaster Control Plan, that implements immediate disaster control recovery operations to ensure the performance of essential functions and responsibilities in ti"
