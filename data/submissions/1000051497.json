Philips has global policies related to the Health and Safety of employees, sustainable operations within the community both locally and globally, as well as Environmental Policies outlining the commitment to pollution prevention\r\nPhilips Lumileds is committed to maintaining a safe work environment. The EHS Department for the Philips Lumileds San Jose site ensures that safe practices are followed in operations involving hazardous materials. This site has well-established emergency procedures and an active Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, including response to emergencies related to the regulated substances covered by this RMP. This team has participated with the gas supplier in joint drills to practice the use of the emergency response equipment that is specific to the bulk ammonia ISO modules and bulk liquid hydrogen system. On a periodic basis, Philips hosted the local engine companies, as well as the San Jose Hazardous Incidence Team to tour the facility and become familiar with the operations, emergency equipment and response capabilities from the on-site response team.  The site has written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Philips Lumileds employees, the public, and the environment in the event of a hazardous material release.\r\n\r\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:  \r\nThis facility is located at 370 West Trimble Road in San Jose, California.  With operations in two buildings and an additional support building, the overall facility consists of a little over half a million square feet on a campus of 84 acres.\r\nThis facility is a light emitting diode (LED) manufacturing and R&D operation with the production capacity for billions of lamps annually.

Because the operations are working 24/7, all shifts are represented on the ERT, with fully functional response capabilities at any time of day or night. The team is trained on a monthly basis with drills conducted once a quarter."

The InGaN is the basis for the green to blue frequencies of light as well as the phosphor converted white, soft white and amber colors.  The ammonia is the nitrogen source for this process. The hydrogen is used as a carrier gas.\r\n\r\nAccidental release prevention steps: \r\nThe operations of this facility are regulated by agencies across the spectrum of jurisdiction: City, County, Special Districts, State, and Federal.  From local building & fire codes, to California hazardous waste treatment and storage requirements up to Federal transportation, OSHA, and EPA requirements.  The bulk of the engineering and effort have been in the upfront preventive measures to minimize the release of and control release emissions of all hazardous materials, but with particular attention paid to the bulk ammonia distribution system and bulk hydrogen distribution systems. Some of the engineering controls built into the system include fully welded lines, exhausted enclosures for all mechanical fittings, gas monitoring, excess flow shutoff, restrictive flow orifices, emergency ammonia abatement equipment, dedicated specialized emergency response equipment, as well as training, operational procedures and a preventive maintenance program.  \r\n\r\nFive year accident history:\r\nThere has been one incident involving hydrogen in the last 5 years, resulting in an explosion of 0.2 lbs of hydrogen, this incident was contained onsite with no off-site consequences. There have been no accidental releases related to the ammonia processes covered by this RMP.\r\n\r\nEmergency response program:\r\n In addition to engineering controls designed to avoid single component point of failure leading to a release, and the stand by emergency abatement solution, this facility maintains an on-site emergency response team (ERT) trained and equipped to deal with a failure of the contai"
