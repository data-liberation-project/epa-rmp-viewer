This plant is engaged in the storage and transfer of anhydrous ammonia to be used as a nitrogen fertilizer.\n\nThe worst case release would be the rupture of our largest vessel, a 3,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia tank, releasing approximately 140,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonis.  Using RMP Comp. as a model, this would give a toxic endpoint of 6.9 miles possibly affecting 4268 people depending on wind speed and direction.\n\nOne alternative release, again using RMP Comp., would be the rupture of piping resulting from a transport driving away before disconnecting the delivery hose.  This release would last approximatley 10 minutes resulting in the release of approximatley 40,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia having an endpoint of 2.2 miles and possibly affecting 970 people depending on wind speed and direction.\n\nAnother alternative release would be the rupture of a hose at the loading riser.  This would result in the release of approximatley 266 pounds of anhydrous ammonia having an endpoint of approximatley 0.8 miles and  possibly affecting 154 people depending on wind speed and direction.\n\nBoth alternative releases should be stopped by automatic excess flow valves installed in the piping system.\n\nConsumers Oil Company is regulated by the Missouri Deptartment of Agriculture and also conducts its own inspections of plant, tanks, piping, and hoses used in the transfer and storage of anhydrous ammonia.
