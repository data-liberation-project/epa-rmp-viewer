This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes. The company policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE S AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nAGE Refining Inc. operates two regulated flammable substance processes, (e.g., propane, butane) from raw crude oil.  The threshold planning quantities defined in 40 CFR 68.130 are exceeded for Propane, Isobutane, Butane and Isopentane.  This is based on the actual maximum inventory and the composition of the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) in Tank 900-1\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nThe Worst Case Scenario (WCS) associated with a release of a regulated flammable substance at the refinery is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the LPG storage tank. Administrative controls are in place to limit the storage inventory in the tank; therefore, 75% of the full tank inventory, 20,570 gallons of LPG, is assumed to be released, completely vaporized into 98,000 lbs of LPG, and ignited, resulting in a VCE. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this tank is 1968 feet (0.37 miles) from the storage site. No credit for passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS. Note that the relief valve for this tank is piped to the plant emergency flare. The flare will act as a safety device in the event of an unanticipated release. This tank will also have an automated deluge fire suppressant system per NFPA requirements, designed by North Star Fire S"

      "SummaryText": "ystems.\n\nThe Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) for regulated flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from the release of propane or butane from the Debutanizer Tower or the lines to the plant storage tanks. A leak in the tower or lines would result in 1,000 lbs of vapors being released over a 15-minute period. The release would be expected to be isolated by the operators within 15 minutes (active mitigation). The predominate winds are from the southwest to northeast. The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this alternative scenario with a successive explosion would be 260 feet or 0.05 miles from the source.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery. Because processes at the refinery are subject to the OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAGE Refining Inc., has established a Process Safety Management Committee (PSMC) consisting of employees from all operational facets to review, evaluate and make recommendations to management on the safe operation of the plant processes. The company also encourages employees to participate in the plants safety and loss control program. Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery safety and accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, mainten"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS's). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. The refinery ensures the process is maintained within design limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, and experienced personnel.\nThe Process Safety Management study determined and documented that the refinery's existing equipment was designed and constructed in accordance with codes, standards and practices no longer in general use; however, the plant is being operated within the parameters previously established to ensure the safety of the personnel and the public.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nAGE Refining Inc., does not have the threshold quantities of Regulated Toxic Substances required under the Environmental Protection Agency\u00bfs Rule 40 CFR 68.130, however the plant does have the threshold planning quantities of  Flammable Substances.  AGE Refining Inc. does not  have threshold quantities of the Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Toxins or Reactives as defined by Appendix A of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration' Standard 29 CFR 1910.119; however, AGE Refining Inc. has performed a process hazard analysis that has identified concerns that could lead to a catastrophic incident.

The original analyses were conducted using consultants Double D Safety Enterprises, LLC., represented D. B. Deady, CHST., FSR., ASC., and Sam Duckworth, P. E. and an AGE Refining Inc.'s team , who have operating and maintenance experience. Recent analysis have been conducted by Tejas Environmental, Health & Safety and the plant PSM committee. The consultants and team performed the study and identified potential hazards of the plant processes within the confines of the operating units. The PSM committee submitted the recommendations to management.\nImplementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PSMC and consultant. This ranking helps ensure that potential accidents assigned the highest risk received immediate attention. \nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original study, AGE Refining Inc. will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. The PSM committee findings will be forwarded to management for consideration.\n\nOperating Procedures\nAGE Refining Inc., has established procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and (5) normal shutdown.\n\nTraining\nAGE Refining Inc. has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operations.

After operators demonstrate having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.\n\nContractors\nAGE Refining Inc. uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process over-view, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, contractor safety programs and records are evaluated.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRS)\nIn the event of a new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information, a PSSR will be performed by the design engineer.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nAGE Refining Inc., has established practices and procedures to maintain and repair pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors. The staff is also trained in emergency shut down of equipment and systems. Maintenance personnel receive training, on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in"

If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service.\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. AGE Refining Inc., has a policy of replacement-in-kind for all materials used to correct deficiencies.\n\nSafe Work Practices\nAGE Refining Inc., has established safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance or repair, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\nAll process changes, if they occur, will be reviewed by the designing professional engineer.  AGE Refining Inc.  has implemented a Management of Change System to review and document future process modifications.\n\nIncident Investigation\nAGE Refining Inc., promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, AGE Refining Inc. wi"

Compliance audits will be conducted at least every 3 years. The audit team will develop findings and will forward the findings to refinery management for resolution. \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe processes at AGE Refining Inc.'s plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. Collectively, accident prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human errors.\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, process safety features exist on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce \n\nthe consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\nRelease Detection\nHydrocarbon detectors with alarms within the Crude Unit.\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\u00bf\tProcess relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\n\u00bf\tValves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\n\u00bf\tCurbing and/or diking to contain liquid releases.\n\u00bf\tRedundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., independent firewater system).\nRelease Mitigation\n\u00bf\tFire suppression and extinguishing systems.\n\u00bf\tOn-site fire wagon and foam cannon.\n\u00bf\tTrained and certified hazard materials emergency response and industrial firefighting personnel.\n\n\u00bf\tPersonal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nAGE Refining Inc. has an excellent record of accident prevention.
