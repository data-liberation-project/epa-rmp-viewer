Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Henderson Community Coop in Henderson are strongly committed to employee, public, and\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does\noccur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of\nthe release.  We also coordinate our response efforts with the Henderson Fire Department, which\nprovides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\nammonia stored in two 30,000-gallon, two 11,000-gallon, one 26,000-gallon, and one 18,000-gallon\ninterconnected  tanks at our facility in Henderson (Figure 1, ammonia).  The maximum amount\nstored is 107,100 gallons (551,136.6 pounds) at the maximum fill capacity of 85 %.\n\nWe also have propane stored in two 18,000-gallon interconnected tanks  located at our facility in  \n Henderson (Figure 1, propane).  The maximum amount stored is 30,600 gallons (129,223.8  pounds)\nat the maximum fill capacity of 85 %.\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\nWe utilized RMP PRO for the worst case and alternate case scenarios of the required offsite\nconsequence analysis for our ammonia and propane facility.  The following details these scenarios.\n\n            3.1     Ammonia\n\nT"

At Class F atmospheric stability, 1.5 m/s wind speed, and a urban  topography, the\nmaximum distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is 9.9 miles (Figure 2).  The estimated\npopulation within a 9.9-mile radius of this facility is 3,000.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from an anhydrous ammonia product line.  The\nscenario involves the release of 7616.42 pounds of ammonia in a gaseous form over a period of 30\nminutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14\nmg/L of ammonia is 0.31 mile (Figure 3).  The estimated population within a 0.31-mile radius of the\nfacility is 200.\n\n            3.2     Propane\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\ninterconnected propane storage tank (129,223.8 pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period. \nAt Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance to an endpoint of\n1 psi overpressure is 0.41 miles (Figure 2).  This amount of overpressure can cause partial\ndemolition of houses and can result in serious injury to people within this distance.  The estimated\npopulation within a 0.41-mile radius of this facility is 500.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a 30-minute release of propane from a product line that\ncontacts an ignition source and detonates, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under neutral\nweather conditions, the maximum distance to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.12  mile (Figure\n3).  The estimated population within a 0.12 -mile radius of this facility is 30.\n\n  4.

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a\ntimely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nHenderson Community Coop maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within\nour covered processes are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation;\nthe information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nHenderson Community Coop has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that\nemployees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with\nthese processes.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nHenderson Community Coop conducts documented maintenance checks on process equipment to\nensure proper operation.  Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous\ntraining in maintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance\nchecks include:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Henderson Community Coop to manage changes in process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
