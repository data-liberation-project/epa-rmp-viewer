It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the Percival Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Fremont County, Iowa Emergency Management Agency (Red Haun) will be made.\n\nWhile we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be much different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have be planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in the manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what may have been planned will serve only as a guideline to follow.\n\nThe Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals (i.e., Anhydrous Ammonia), tornadoes, bomb threats or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator for the Percival, Iowa location is Sylvia Meek, co-owner.

In the unlikely event that the Percival Fire Department is unable to adequately respond to an emergency at our Percival location, the Volunteer Fire Department with whom Percival has a reciprocal agreement will be summoned.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and Fremont County LEPC (EMA). Members of the fire department and the LEPC have inspected our anhydrous ammonia plant. In addition, copies of photographs taken of our plant have been provided (for reference) to both entities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nThe plan is to minimize those hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working at the bulk storage plant make routine observations prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage vessel(s) to nurse tanks.  In so doing, they are able to detect problems before they arise.  This routine inspection identifies any portion of the system which may be under stress or about to fail.  Repairs can be made beforfe they become problematic.  Employees are annually trained to recognize the hazards associated with storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  In additiion to annual training foremployees who have been on the job for a number of years, the company conducts training for new hires.  This training includes classroom instruction, on-site training at the plant, and follow-up observation to determine their individual comprehension and understanding of the new hire.  Finally, the company routenly invites local fire department personnel to visit the site.  In the event that the local fi"

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at  this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes. \n\nThe system consists of one (1)  30,000-gallon  storage tanks with associated piping, valves, liquid pump(s), and other miscellaneous equipment. The anhydrous ammonia plant is only operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall). Full-time equivalent employee numbers were computed on that basis. At a maximum, the plant operates a total of three months (1/4 of the year). The FTEs for this company location is six (6). At any one time as many as thirty-six (36) 1,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks may also be positioned in and around the plant property.\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the one (1) 30,000-gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form. According to EPA's RMP*Comp Program (Version 1.06), the distance to the endpoint is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the transport delivery vehicle pulling away from the intake lines into the storage plant without disconnecting the transfer hoses.  The resulting release, according to EPA's RMP*Comp Program has a distance to endpoint of 0.1 miles."

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standard K-61.1-1989 with amendments and State law. \n\nIn addition the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental (and potentially catastrophic) release of anhydrous ammonia. Finally, Percival Farm Service, Inc.  Has extended to the Percival Volunteer Fire Department the opportunity to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant, to participate in mock emergency simulation training, and to avail themselves of specific anhydrous ammonia health hazard information and training provided by the company.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nOn September 22, 2007, unidentified individuals apparently intent upon illegally obtaining anhydrous ammonia (presumably for the production of methamphetamines) or simply an act of vandalism entered the Percival farm Service, Inc. facility. Locking valve covers were in place on portable nurse tank units. The hose end valves on the transfer hoses at the riser stand were enclosed in a locked box. The individual broke open the lock box and one of the vapor transfer lines was opened and, subsequently left open, allowing vapor to escape unencumbered to the atmosphere. A vapor cloud developed which enveloped the immediate area including portions of Interstate 29. Emergency response officials responded to the scene, including the Council Bluffs, Iowa Area HazMat Unit. It was determined that residents in the community of Percival (approximately 75 - 80) should be evacuated until the release was secured. There"
