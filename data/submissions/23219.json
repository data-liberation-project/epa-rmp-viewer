The maximum quantity handled would be the loading of a delivery truck holding 50,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of our storage tank released as a liquid over 74.5 minutes. The maximum quantity release would be 60,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage tank. The distance to the endpoint is.3698 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario would be the failure of a liquid spill which would release 2000 pounds over 43.2 minutes. The distance to endpoint would be .0774 miles.\n\nCentral Montana Co-op has implenmented the provions of \"Safety Requirements of the Storage and Handling of Amhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ), 29 CER 1910.111,\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental release of Aqua Ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nCentral Montana Co-op's emergency response program is provided to the state and county under the emergency planning and community r"
