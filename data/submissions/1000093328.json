The Risk Management Plan is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP definitions and requirements, including:\r\nA\u00b7 Pleasant Prairie's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\nA\u00b7 Facility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\nA\u00b7 Hazard Assessment;\r\nA\u00b7 Prevention Program;\r\nA\u00b7 Five-Year Accident History;\r\nA\u00b7 Emergency Response Plan; and\r\nA\u00b7 Planned changes to improve safety.\r\n\r\nPLEASANT PRAIRIE POLICIES TO PROTECT HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT, AND SAFETY\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Pleasant Prairie; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Pleasant Prairie is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment.\r\n\r\nFACILITY IDENTIFICATION\r\nThe Rust-Oleum Corporation owns and operates a paint manufacturing plant in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. LP gas (propane/butane mixture) is used at the facility as a propellant for aerosol paints. LP gas is a regulated flammable RMP substance with a threshold quantity for accidental release prevention of 10,000 pounds. The amount of LP gas present in the system is approximately 114,000 pounds.   \r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT - WORST CASE SCENARIOS (WCS)\r\nThe WCS was determined by EPA's OCA Guidance document.\r\n\r\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT - ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS (ARS)\r\nThe ARS was determined by EPA's OCA Guidance document.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 C"
