Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by Plumrose personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \n\n\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nPlumrose provides employment for approximately 390 workers in Booneville, Mississippi. This facility is a meat processing plant owned by JBS USA, LLC, which has headquarters at 1770 Promontory Cir., Greely, CO 80631.  The facility is operated by Plumrose USA, Inc., which has headquarters at 651 W. Washington Blvd., Suite 302, Chicago, Illinois 60661.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process. Plumrose receives meat products that have been processed off-site and slices the products for packaging. From the time the meat products are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 of the RMP regulation.\n\n\n\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Plumrose completed a compilation of written process safety information to be used in conducting the process hazard analysis (PHA). The last PHA was conducted on March 20, 2019, using the pro"

This process safety information included information pertaining to the hazards of Ammonia (anhydrous), information pertaining to the technology of the Ammonia refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Ammonia refrigeration process. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Plumrose updated and re-validated the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA was conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and was performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the Ammonia refrigeration process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used. A system has been established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Plumrose developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Ammonia (anhydrous) is utilized. These written operating procedures are consistent with the process safety information and address steps for each operating phase, operating limitations, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions. These operating procedures are readily accessible to employees who work in or maintain the Ammonia refrigeration process.

These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining: Plumrose provides training for each employee associated with the Ammonia refrigeration process. This training includes an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined by 40 CFR 68.71. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary. Plumrose documents and maintains records of the employee, the date of training, and the means used to verify that the employee understood the training. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: Plumrose has the following written documents and programs to maintain the on-going integrity of the equipment used in the Ammonia refrigeration process (i.e., storage tanks, piping systems, etc); additionally, inspections, testing, equipment deficiencies, and quality assurance are addressed:\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Study of Process Equipment\n\n\n\nPreventative Maintenance Program:\n\nEach person who has responsibilities to perform maintenance on the ammonia process components receives training at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change: Plumrose established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures; and, changes to Plumrose that affect the Ammonia refrigeration process.

If a change in the process results in a change in the operation procedures or practices, such procedures or practices are updated accordingly. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Review: Plumrose performs a pre-startup review according to 40 CFR 68.77 when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information. \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: Plumrose certifies that they have evaluated compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR, Part 68 at least every three years to verify that procedures developed under 40 CFR, Part 68 are adequate and are being followed. The compliance audit is conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the Ammonia refrigeration process. A report of the findings of the audit is developed, and Plumrose promptly determines and documents an appropriate response to each of the findings of the compliance audit, and document that deficiencies have been corrected. Records of the two (2) most recent compliance audit reports are maintained. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: Plumrose investigates each incident, which results in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Ammonia (anhydrous). Incident investigations are initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours following the incident. The incident investigation team consists of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.
