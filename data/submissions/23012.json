Based on the\ncombined volume of 40,835 pounds (equivalent to 8,430 gallons), the estimated impact distance\nfrom the tanks was 0.25 miles based on the modeling, and 0.3 miles from the look-up tables from\n(Table 13) for 50,000 pounds.  Interpolation from the look-up tables for the actual volume of the\nrelease also estimated the distance to be 0.25 miles.  To be conservative, the 0.3 mile radius was\nselected as the RMP impact area.\n\nOnce the radius was established, comparison of the distance to the number of households was\nperformed using Geographical Information System (GIS) data of the area.  Based on the\navailable data, it was estimated that 226 households are within the 0.3 mile radius.  Based on an\nestimated occupancy of 4 people per household, it is estimated that approximately 904 people\nlive within the 0.3 mile radius of the facility.   Additionally, 2 schools were identified as a sensitive\nreceptors with the 0.3 mile radius.\n\nEvaluation of the school locations indicate that they are shielded from the fire/explosion\npotential by both the physical facility of the plant, as well as topographically.  The schools are\nlocated to the northwest of the facility, and adjacent to the facility property line.  The schools are\nbuilt in a topographic depression below the surface level of the facility in such a manner that\nonly the peaks of the school roof  can be seen from the adjacent property of the school."

      "SummaryText": "VALSPAR Fremont Facility-Executive Summary\n\nThe VALSPAR Fremont Facility is located in the city of Fremont, Newago County, Michigan.  The facility has been in continuous operation at this location since 1975.  The facility packages consumer and specialty products into user-sized quantities.  Brands most associated with this facility include Dri-Slide and Guardsman, and many other OEM products for companies such as Chrysler and many others.\n\nThe VALSPAR Fremont Facility is required to submit the 122(r) Risk Management Plan (RMP) plan\nbased on the on-site storage of gaseous fuels which are used as propellant in the aerosol can\nproduct lines.  These gaseous propellants consist of propane, isobutane, and butane.  Originally\nthe decision of the US Court or Appeals exempted this facility from filing the 112R plan\nbecause the facility was below the revised threshold for the gaseous fuels at the facility.\nSubsequent evaluation and decisions by the U.S. EPA have clarified that facilities required to use these gaseous fuels as propellant, and not fuels used to power engines, are required that VALSPAR complete and submit this 112(r) Risk Management Plan.\n\nThe facility has 5 horizontal above ground storage tanks for gaseous fuels.  Two tanks are used\nto store a 50/50 blend of butane and isobutane, and the other three are used to store propane. \nTwo of the propane tanks are used as propellants, and one small propane tank is used as motor\nfuels for forklift trucks.\n\nBased on a combined volume of 40,835 pounds of the gaseous fuel propane, isobutane , and\nbutane (propellant and forklift fuels), VALSPAR has evaluated a worst-case scenario for the explosion\nand fire resulting from the release of these compounds.  For the purposes of this evaluation, the\nworst case scenario was identified as having all five (5) gaseous fuel tanks explode at the same\ntime.  As allowed in the EPA Guidance Document(Section 5, Page 5-2) to allow for the\ncalculation of a worst-case release, the total volum"
