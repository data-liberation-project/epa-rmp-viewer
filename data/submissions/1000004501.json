Our commitment is supported by the resources invested in accident prevention, personnel training and the consideration of safety issues in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of our facilities.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to provide a safe operation and prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained gas plant personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant is located about 20 miles south of Gillette, Wyoming.  The facility includes liquid recovery using a refrigeration system, compression, dehydration, power generation, and fractionation.  The plant produces a lean, dry residue gas stream, liquid propane, liquid butane and a mixed natural gas liquid stream (natural gasoline).  The liquid products contain ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and heavier components.  The liquids that are recovered from the refrigeration process including propane, butane and the natural gasoline are shipped from the plant by truck and railcar.  The plant handles regulated flammables such as ethane, propane, mixed butanes and mixed pentanes.  Since the plant does not handle threshold quantities of any materials classified as toxic, there are no toxic release scenarios to consider at the Hilight/Reno Junction facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThis narrative section has been deleted as directed by the regulation.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.   The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency\u00c2\u00bfs ("

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance mechanism by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, heat exchangers, compressors and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.  All of these activities are tracked and documented using Avantis, an asset manager database.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on 1) an overview of the process, 2) safety and health hazards, 3) applicable maintenance procedures, 4) emergency response plans, and 5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their jobs in a safe manner.  Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to verify that equipment parameters are within acceptable limits.  For a vessel, the parameter being monitored would typically be wall thickness. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible) or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.  \n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

The Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to emergency situations.  The Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the local emergency response organizations and the gas plant provides annual refresher training to local emergency responder regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the gas plant.   \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety-\n\nAll of the procedures in place at the plant undergo a complete review annually to assure that they are consistent with the safety design and operation of the process.  Any changes made to the procedures are documented and all employees are retrained before allowing them to operate that portion of the process.  All safety programs affecting the plant will be reviewed in 2009 to assure they meet the requirements of the regulations as well as providing the training to plant personnel to assure the facility staff has the knowledge to follow them.  The plant also holds annual training on the emergency response plan.  This training has included the local emergency response groups including, local ambulance services and the local fire departments.  These training sessions are audited by company safety personnel."

This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify the operators understanding of the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the gas plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors 1) perform their work in a safe manner, 2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, 3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, 5) understand and follow site safety rules, and 6) inform gas plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with 1) process overview, 2) information about safety and health hazards, 3) emergency response plan requirements, 4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work, 5) safe and hot work permits as required.  In addition the company has a program in place that evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  No contractor is allowed to perform work at the plant unless they have met the requirements of this evaluation process.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

These procedures along with training of affected personnel form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to 1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, 2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change, and 3) ensure that changes do not introduce an unknown hazard to the process.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided necessary training on the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, major property damage, or significant environmental loss or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents it findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence and forwards these results to gas plant managemen"

The following summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the gas plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of the PSM program.  This program as well as the other documentation is maintained at the gas plant. In addition the PSM program requires that we address process and employee safety issues as part of our normal operations.  These include development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, our \u00c2\u00bfSafe Start\u00c2\u00bf program, and participation in flowsheet reviews. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The Operations group has been assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  The location of these documents is readily available to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment consideration, is provided in mate"

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.   For specific process areas, the gas plant has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters in operating manuals.  The gas plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant uses the What If/Checklist method of performing a process hazards analysis (PHA) to evaluate the hazards associated with the process.  These PHAs are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, emergency shutdown and normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they are current and accurate.  The procedures are also kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, the Hilight/Reno Junction gas plant has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate the knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodi"
