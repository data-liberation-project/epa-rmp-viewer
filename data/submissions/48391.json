      "SummaryText": "American Development Corporation strives to provide the best training possible by keeping employees involved in the safety process. It is the practice of upper management to promote safety at all times. Because we deal with water treatment plants product quality and public safety is a big concern.\n\nAmerican Development repackages chmicals in smaller quantities for the smaller water treatmenrt facilities. We deliver 90% of all products to the water plants on our own trucks with our drivers. The only regulated product that we handle over the threshold amount is chloine gas which is used in the sanitation of water.\n\nWe do not fill any chlorine gas cylinders on site, all we do is deliver them. All cylinders are sealed from the manufacture when at our facility and they are not opened or hooked up on our site. The only possibiities of any release of these products is through natural disasters, acts of terrorism, container failure, human error or fire. We try to do everthing possible to secure the cylinders from human error by keeping them in racks to prevent them from being knocked over and keeping all safety caps in place. Cylinders are kept in an opened metal warehouse away from combustible items to help in the event of fire. Our facility is fenced in and we have security cameras to aid in acts of terrorism.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of this product in five years.\n\nWe strive to work with local fire departments and rescue personnel which would aide in the event of a release. We have been to the local fire department to explain location of the chlorine cylinders and possible scenarios to expect."
