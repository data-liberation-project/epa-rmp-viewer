      "SummaryText": "HUNTSMAN DAYTON - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n \n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.  Huntsman Dayton Plant is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work place for its employees and neighbors.  Huntsman Dayton Plant maintains a working Process Safety Management (PSM) program, which implements a series of steps to prevent potential hazards associated with the process and assures a well-trained work force.   The PSM program further implements its policies with onsite procedures and manuals.  Huntsman Dayton Plant participates with community agencies to develop emergency response plans and participates in cooperative training with these agencies.\n \n2.  Regulated Substances.  Huntsman Dayton Plant is located about five miles west of Dayton, Texas.  The Dayton Plant takes raw materials and uses batch or continuous operations to produce useful chemicals which other companies then process into cosmetics, epoxy coatings and other consumer products.  Huntsman's Dayton Plant has 3 regulated substances at the facility:\nThe three toxic substances are:\n? Ethylene Oxide (EO) - Used to manufacture printed circuit boards and in water treating chemicals.\n? Propylene Oxide (PO) - Used in making non-toxic solvents and in food preservation.\n  Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) - Used in petroleum drilling fluids and commercial surfactants.\n \n3.  Offsite Consequence Analysis  \nOffsite Consequence Analyses have been conducted per the requirements of 40 CFR 68 and are detailed in the Registration section.\n\n4.  General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Following is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman Dayton Plant has implemented to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.  \n\n?

Hazards of regulated substances:  For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal protective equipment and the appropriate first aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n? The technology of the process:  Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of temperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n? Equipment in the process:  Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and instrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n \n? Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n Huntsman Dayton Plant has performed Process Hazard Analysis on each process to identify the potential hazards, identify any previous incidents (that had a likely potential for catastrophic consequences in the workplace) the adequacy of the engineering and administrative applicable to the hazards and their inter-relationships such as appropriate application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of increases. The PHA's also addressed consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility or stationary source siting, human factors and a qualitative evaluation of a range of possible safety and health effects of failure of controls. Dayton Plant utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and evaluating hazards in the process.  Dayton Plant assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are knowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process.  The HAZOP team develops recommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable period of time. Huntsman Dayton Plant completes a PHA Revalidation every 5-years meeting the requirements of the "

Operating Procedures\n Huntsman Dayton Plant maintains written operating procedures that were developed in consultation with operators to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities associated with a covered process.  The procedures address steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures and precautions to prevent exposures to process hazards.  The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy and completeness.\n \n? Training\n Huntsman Dayton Plant provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required level of skills and knowledge are maintained.  The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency operations, and safe work practices.  All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n \n? Mechanical Integrity\n Huntsman Dayton Plant has developed written procedures for maintaining the operating components of the process (including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown system controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program.  The program is comprised of well-trained personnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n \n? Management of Change (MOC)\n Huntsman Dayton Plant has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that affect a covered process.  The procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the proposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary time period for the change, and any authorization requirements.  Employees involved in operating a process, as well as maintenance and contract employees whose job will be affected, are informed of and trained in the change.  If nece"

Pre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n Huntsman Dayton Plant performs Pre-Startup Safety Reviews when the addition of or a modification to the facility is made that is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review confirms, prior to the introduction of highly hazardous chemicals, that construction and equipment is in accordance with design specifications; safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place; Management-of-Change requirements are met; and training of employees affected by modifications is complete.\n \n\n? Compliance Audit\n Huntsman Dayton Plant performs audits of its compliance with the provisions of its Process Safety Management program.  Teams comprised of employees, with appropriate knowledge of audit techniques, process safety and operating experience, conduct audits every three years to verify that the procedures and practices developed are adequate and being followed.  The findings of the audit team are reviewed and appropriate corrective actions are implemented and tracked until resolved.\n \n? Incident Investigation\n Huntsman Dayton Plant investigates any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of covered chemicals.  The investigation is promptly conducted, commencing within 48 hours of any incident.  To perform the investigation, Huntsman Dayton Plant has established an incident investigation team consisting of persons with the appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident.  A report is prepared at the conclusion of the incident investigation that addresses the incident, the factors that contributed to it, and recommendations resulting from the incident investigation.

Huntsman Dayton Plant ensures that all employees have access to PHA's and all other Process Safety Management information.\n \n? Hot Work Permit\n Huntsman Dayton Plant employs a Hot Work Permit program for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process (hot work generally involves electric or gas welding, cutting, brazing or similar spark-producing operations).  If any hot work is performed near a covered process, Huntsman Dayton Plant issues a permit that documents the fire prevention and protection requirements for the operation, the date authorized for hot work, and the object on which the work is performed.  Hot Work Permits are kept on file until the work is complete.  \n \n? Contractors\n Huntsman Dayton Plant has developed procedures for selecting and ensuring that contractors are competent and knowledgeable and can safely perform their work.  Huntsman Dayton Plant provides information to them about the hazards that may be present in the work area and has developed appropriate safe work practices.
