If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the City of Lead Fire Department.\n\nFacility and substance description:\nThis facility is a surface and underground gold and silver ore mining facility. We use propane fuel for our emergency backup winter heating system. The heating system consists of one 18,000 gallon propane tank and associated piping, valves, burners and other miscellaneous equipment. This tank is kept at 75% capacity.\n\nWorst case release senario:\nOur worst-case release senario is failure of the 18,000 gallon tank when filled to the maximum capacity(88% at 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nGeneral release Prevention:\nThis site complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nFive year accident summary:\nIn the last five years we have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nEmergency response program:\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propane system, it is our policy to notify the City of Lead Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety: None"
