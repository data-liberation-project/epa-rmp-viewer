This document consists of the executive summary and registration data elements (68.155 through 68.185).\n\n\n\n1.0 RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nOCI Beaumont LLC (OCI) operates an ammonia and methanol plant located at 5470 North Twin City Highway, Nederland, TX.  The site uses chlorine for its process and produces anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) and methanol on site that requires protection as defined under the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Threshold Quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  OCI has implemented a PSM program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphasizes the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.  OCI has also implemented a RMP and Emergency Response Plan to document how a response to a release at OCI is conducted and how the information is provided to the emergency response agencies.  This submittal is the updated Risk Management Plan as the required 5-year resubmittal by OCI Beaumont LLC. OCI has implemented an Emergency Response Program to ensure the safety of its employees, the community, and the environment. This detailed emergency response program includes procedures for handling an emergency.   All of these components make the Emergency Action Plan a thorough and comprehensive plan for release prevention and emergency response. The emergency response policies at OCI Beaumont ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours - 7 days per week. In accordance with the 2004 amendment to the RMP regulations, the off-site consequence analyses (OCA) are not included in this executive summary.\n\n\n\n2.0"

      "SummaryText": " PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOCI Beaumont LLC produces and stores anhydrous ammonia and uses chlorine for the water treatment process.  These units have similar prevention program elements and are included together in Section 7 of the RMPlan.  Anhydrous Ammonia, Synthesis (Syn) Gas (mixture of Methane and Hydrogen), and Chlorine are PSM/RMP covered chemicals at the facility. The ammonia produced and stored is used primarily as an agricultural nitrogen fertilizer.  Ammonia is produced at the site and transported by barge, pipeline, and truck.   Ammonia is stored in two refrigerated Ammonia Tanks.  Methanol is produced at the site using natural gas/syn gas mixture.  The maximum inventory of ammonia is approximately 74,000,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory of Syn Gas is approximately 24,000 pounds, and the maximum inventory of chlorine is 16,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.0 GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL - SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nOCI Operations has developed an OSHA PSM/RMP program for OCI Beaumont Facility.  At OCI Beaumont, ammonia, syngas and chlorine fall under the RMP Program 3 Prevention Program, which is identical to the OSHA PSM program. EPA has said that if the process is in compliance with OSHA PSM, then it is compliance with RMP Program 3. Reviews and assessments of the OCI Beaumont PSM program has shown it to be active and in line with RMP standards.  The PSM/RMP program is documented in various procedures and policies which apply to each standard.  \n\n\n\n4.0 FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe OCI Beaumont plant has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to facility personnel since it was re-commissioned in 2012. There have not been any releases from the plant that required reporting under the RMP five-year accident history.  In case of a reportable chemical accident, information in the RMP will be updated within six month of the date the accident occurred.\n\n\n\n5.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nAs mentioned pr"

The Emergency Response Plan is a detailed document which discusses the roles of employees and management and actions to be taken in the event of an emergency. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations for plant personnel.  The Emergency Response Plan contains specific information regarding: contact numbers; emergency communication; responsibilities; Muster Points; emergency evacuation procedures; notification procedures; training; personnel roles and lines of authority; emergency recognition and prevention; safe distances and places of refuge; site security and control; medical/first aid treatment; emergency alerting and response procedures; PPE and emergency equipment; and standard operating procedures in the event of an ammonia release.\n\n\n\n6.0 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nDue to the OCI Beaumont's exemplary safety record, no changes to the existing safety plan have been identified."
