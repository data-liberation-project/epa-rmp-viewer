Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Union Carbide Seadrift Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide's Responsible CareR requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) rule and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  The information from the Risk Management Plan has been shared with plant neighbors, LEPC members, elected officials, and other community members through public meetings.  Input on the plan has been received from the Community Advisory Panel and has been incorporated into the plan as well as the public communication sessions.\n\n2.    Description of the Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Union Carbide Seadrift Plant is a manufacturing facility that annually produces approximately 3.6 billion pounds of plastic, rubber, and other chemical products in its various operating units.  Most are intermediates used in other Union Carbide processes, or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Seadrift Plant, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and/or flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements for that chemical.\n\n  The Union Carbide Seadrift  Plant has the following RMP-regulated toxic substances in quantities above the threshold: \n\nRMP Toxic Chemicals    RMP Flammable Chemicals\n    \nEthylene Oxide    1,3-Butadiene\nAmmonia    Butene-1\nVinyl Acetate    Ethane\nTitanium Tetrachloride    E"

Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\n\nEPAs RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site impact of the scenarios.  Steps to prevent these scenarios from occurring, and to mitigate their effects should they occur, appear in Section 4.\nA)  Regulated Toxic Chemicals \nWorst-Case Release Scenario --\nThis scenario assumes an over-pressure and rupture of a storage tank, releasing 294,000 pounds of ethylene oxide as a gas to the atmosphere.  An administrative control limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85 percent (294,000 pounds).  According to EPAs Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. .  The following administrative control is used in this analysis:\n7 Inventory Restriction:  Written operating procedures and a high-level shutdown system limits the maximum filling capacity of this storage tank to 85 percent (294,000 pounds).\n\nIn addition, specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Double Wall Tank:  The tank has a secondary tank wall which is designed to contain a leak in the primary wall.\n7 Secondary Wall Leak Detection:  A sensor is designed to detect leaks between the primary and secondary walls of the tank.\n7 Enclosed Tanks:  The surge tanks are inside concrete containment walls and covered with gravel to minimize the potential for external impact.\n7 Secondary Containment Around Tanks:  The area around the tanks is diked and curbed to contain spills.\n7 Combustible Gas Detectors Interlocked to Sprinkler-Deluge System:  This system is designed to detect flammable vapors and to autom"

The area is always under surveillance of a remotely operated camera to detect unusual circumstances.\n7 Flares:  Pressure relief devices are routed to a flare for destruction of  ethylene oxide.\n7 Fire Water Monitors:  In addition to the sprinkler-deluge system, area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress ethylene oxide vapors.\n  Alternative Release Scenarios --\nEthylene Oxide:  This scenario assumes a pressure relief valve on equipment in the Oxide Unit opens and relieves 3000 pounds of ethylene oxide over a five minute period.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. The following active mitigation measures are used in this analysis:\n7 Emergency Shutdown System:  A manual emergency shutdown system is designed to shut down the pumps, compressors, and heat transfer equipment and put the valves in a fail-safe position.\n7 Surveillance: Unit operating conditions such as temperature, pressure and flow rates are continuously monitored in the control room and upset conditions such as in the scenario are immediately detected.\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Combustible Gas Detectors Interlocked to Sprinkler-Deluge System:  This system is designed to detect flammable vapors and to automatically activate the deluge system (water spray) to suppress flammable vapors.\n7 Fire Water Monitors:  In addition to the sprinkler-deluge system, area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress ethylene oxide vapors.\nAnhydrous Ammonia:  This scenario"

According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.  The following active mitigation measure is used in this analysis:\n7 Excess Flow Check Valves:  The valves are designed to check closed when the flow rate exceeds the designed limit, as would be the case with a hose rupture.  The check valve is not positive isolation, but instead it serves to limit the flow rate.  The result is a decrease in the downwind concentration of ammonia.\n\nOther specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring, and to mitigate its effects should they occur, include:\n7 Leak Detection:  Ammonia leak detectors, installed in the unloading area and around the storage tank, sound an alarm in the control room if a leak should occur.  They also isolate the pressure source used to unload the car.\n7 Deluge system:  A water spray system designed to suppress ammonia vapors can be manually actuated, or automatically actuated by heat.\n7 Fire Water Spray Monitors:  Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress anhydrous ammonia vapors.\n7 Surveillance:  Operators and maintenance employees monitor the work area while unloading ammonia.\n Vinyl Acetate:  This scenario assumes the vinyl acetate storage tank is overfilled and the 3,300 pound liquid release is contained in the diked area around the tank.

The tank is in a diked area to contain and minimize evaporation of the 1,3-butadiene.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.

The persons who cause the release due to an excavation immediately are aware of the release.  This is quickly communicated and source of the material is valved in.  Emergency response plans are rapidly initiated.\n    Other specific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring include:\n Excavation Procedures:  A hazardous work permit and excavation permit are required to dig in the vicinity of the 1,3 butadiene line.  The excavation is either hand-dug or hand-probed ahead of excavation equipment.  Line location is positively identified prior to digging.\n\n4.

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nIn the last five years there has not been an accident or incident involving an EPA RMP chemical at the Union Carbide Seadrift Plant that resulted in an on-site death, injury, or property damage; or a known off-site death, injury, evacuation, shelter-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Seadrift Plant maintains a written emergency response program to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to  releases of hazardous substances, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including:\n\n7 Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures\n7 Evacuation and shelter-in-place plans and accounting for personnel after an incident\n7 Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n7 Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n7 Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes. \n\nThe Seadrift Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases,"
