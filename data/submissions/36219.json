The plan summary is organized to correspond with specific EPA RMP definitions and requirements.\n\nOverall responsibility for all the facility activities, including Risk Management Program activities, lies with the Plant Manager.  The Plant Manager has delegated the following responsibilities:\n\n\u00b7RMP hazard assessment and document control to the Environmental Manager.\n\u00b7Implementation of the RMP prevention program to the Technology Manager.\n\u00b7Development & maintenance of the RMP emergency response program to the Human Resources Safety Manager.\n\u00b7Training and communication of RMP related matters to the Maintenance & Production Manager.\n\nMore specific responsibilities are delegated to other staff positions as detailed in the Plant Emergency Plan.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155 (a):\n\nEVALCA is committed to conducting its operation in a safe, responsible manner and reducing risks to health and the environment.

Ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer is used in the manufacture of consumer goods packaging such as: laundry detergent bottles, ketchup bottles, and plastic lined boxes like those used for drink boxes.\n\nAs part of this production process, two RMP regulated substances are utilized at EVALCA. Based on applicable volumes maintained at the facility, vinyl acetate monomer is a listed toxic material and ethylene is a listed flammable material. \n\nAccidental release prevention program and chemical-specific steps 40 CFR 68.155(d):\n\nIn general, EVALCA has implemented numerous steps to minimize the potential of a release of any chemical on site. All storage tanks are located within diked areas; truck-unloading facilities have been replaced by direct pipeline feeds, which are equipped with low-pressure alarms and automated shut-off valves.  Furthermore, all of the process areas at this facility regulated by the EPA Risk Management Program regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Processes containing materials that are subject to the EPA RMP Rule have been incorporated into the existing OSHA PSM program, resulting in a program that is in compliance with both the OSHA and EPA regulations.  Specific elements of this program include the following:\n\n\u00b7\tEmployee Participation in process safety management and accident prevention,\n\u00b7\tProcess Safety Information,\n\u00b7\tProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA),\n\u00b7\tDocumented Operating Procedures,\n\u00b7\tTraining Programs for all Employees,\n\u00b7\tContractor Requirements and Training,\n\u00b7\tPre-startup Reviews,\n\u00b7\tMechanical Integrity and Quality Assurance Programs,\n\u00b7\tManagement of Change Process,\n\u00b7\tIncident Investigation,\n\u00b7\tCompliance Audits, and\n\u00b7\tSafe Work Practices.\n\nFive-year accident history 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155 (e):\n\nEVALCA has an excellent accident prevention record.

The emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying the local fire authority and any potentially affected neighbors and has been coordinated with local agencies.\n\nEVALCA maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers and the general public as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid, medical treatment for exposure, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  The emergency response program is updated when additional process units are brought on line or when modifications are made to an existing process unit. When the emergency response program is updated, employees are informed of the changes and trained appropriately through the management of change (MOC) process.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety 40 CFR \u00a7 68.155 (g):\n\nChemical Safety is an integral part of the working culture at EVALCA, as demonstrated through our outstanding safety record.
