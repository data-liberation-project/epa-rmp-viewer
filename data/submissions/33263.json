Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nZacky Farms, LLC is strongly committed to the safety of our employees, the public and the\n\nenvironment. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention\n\nprogram that addresses the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee\n\ntraining associated with the covered processes at our facility.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\n\nsubstances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to\n\ncontrol and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the Region 5 LEPC\n\nInland South and the Fresno Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response\n\nexpertise. \n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nZacky's primary activity in Fresno is poultry processing. At our Empire East facility, located at\n\n2950 E. California Ave. in Fresno, CA, we process and package poultry products. Ammonia is\n\nour only RMP regulated substance and is used to provide refrigeration for the cold storage of our\n\npoultry products. The maximum inventory of ammonia at this facility is 47,500 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention\n\nSteps:\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\n\nrequirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The ammonia refrigeration system is also\n\nsubject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and to EPCRA Section 302\n\nnotification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release\n\nprevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nZacky Farms maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\n\nhazards, operating parameters and equipmen"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in\n\nengineering and process operations and are validated at a regular interval of at least five years.\n\nAny findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Zacky Farms has\n\ndeveloped written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation\n\nsuch as initial startup, normal operation, emergency shutdown and startup, and normal shutdown\n\nand startup. This information is regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved\n\nin the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nZacky Farms has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\n\noperating covered processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these\n\nprocesses. Refresher training is provided at least every three years or more frequently as needed.\n\nAll training is documented and validated.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nZacky Farms carries out documented maintenance checks on all covered process equipment to\n\nensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes pressure vessels,\n\nstorage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls\n\nand pumps, compressors, and condensers and evaporators.

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including\n\nadequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response\n\nagencies and the public, as well as post incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and\n\nserviced.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nWe have a PSM/RMP team that meets at least weekly to discuss and review selected sections of\n\nthe program.
