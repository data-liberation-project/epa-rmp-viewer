The emergency response policy is to determine the nature of the release, and if it is a major release then 911 will be called to notify the Lafayette Fire Department/HAZMAT and the Lafayette Police Department and wait for them to respond.  In the event of a minor leak, plant personnel will mitigate the leak themselves.\n\nThe stationary source consists of two (2) one (1) ton cylinders of chlorine, and two (2) one (1) ton cylinder of sulfur dioxide. \n\nThe worst case release scenario would consist of a rupture of the one ton cylinder of chlorine allowing all of the chlorine inside to be released in ten minutes, which would create a chloud of chlorine with a radius of 3.1 miles and have an effected population of 23,000 people.  There are no passive mitigation measures in place to affect the severity of the release.\n\nThe first alternative release scenario consists of a fusible plug blowing out of the chlorine cylinder.  It will take approximately an hour for HAZMAT to respond to the release.  It will have a release rate of 2 lbs/min and will have a radius of effect of 0.3 miles and effect 260 people.  There is no active or passive mitigation in place at the facility.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario consists of a fusible plug blowing out of the sulfur dioxide cylinder.  It will take approximately and hour for HAZMAT to respond to the release.  It will have a release rate of 2 lbs/min and will have a radius of effect of 0.3 miles and effect 260 people.  There is no active or passive mitigation at the facility.\n\nProper training of operators and maintenance personnel prevents accidental release and chemical specific hazards.\n\nThere have been no accidents at the facility in the past five years.\n"
