THIS USEPA RMP SUBMISSION LISTS IN SECTION 1.17 INVENTORY OF >20% AQUEOUS AMMONIA.  NOTE ALSO THAT THE QUANTITY OF >20% AQUEOUS AMMONIA IS THE WEIGHT OF AMMONIA SOLUTE ONLY.  THIS SUBMISSION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE USEPA RMP LIST OF REGULATED MATERIALS.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\n\nNY Terminals, LLC operates a materials storage and transfer facility at its location in Elizabeth, NJ.  NY Terminals (NYT) has operated the facility since October, 2001.  This RMP Registration covers a new process at the Elizabeth site, namely the Aqua Ammonia Process.  This process is designed to receive anhydrous ammonia and produce aqueous ammonia (aqua ammonia).  Aqua ammonia in concentrations ranging from 19% to 29% will be produced.  Aqua ammonia will be produced using a packaged unit (i.e., convertor) and process developed by Spencer-Harris of Arkansas, Inc.  Spencer-Harris has licensed over 400 aqueous ammonia convertors nationwide.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding 5,200-lbs., aqueous ammonia (concentration of 28% or more) exceeding 19,000-lbs., and aqua ammonia (concentration >/= 20%) exceeding 20,000-lbs. are regulated by the NJ Department of Environmental Protection?s (NJDEP) Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) (N.J.A.C. 7:31) as extraordinarily hazardous substances (EHSs).  Anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (concentration exceeding 20%) are also regulated by the USEPA.  This RMP Registration is intended to address the RMP requirements of both the NJDEP and USEPA.\n\nThe production of aqua ammonia requires two raw materials: anhydrous ammonia and water.  There will be no intermediate storage of anhydrous ammonia as it will be fed to the process directly from the receiving vessel.  Liquid anhydrous ammonia is mixed with high purity water in a venturi-action jet to produce 19% aqua ammonia.  19% aqua ammonia passes through cooling coils for heat re"

      "SummaryText": "moval.  19% aqua ammonia will then be stored on-site.  Aqua ammonia in concentrations from 20-29% will be  similarly produced, however it requires a feed of 19% or lower concentration aqua ammonia, along with anhydrous ammonia and water.  29% aqua ammonia will be stored in a stainless steel ASME coded tank.  Aqua ammonia will be loaded into tank trucks and shipped to customers.\n\nACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nNYT has developed a comprehensive Risk Management Program (RMP) designed to identify and manage hazards associated with handling the regulated materials.  In developing the RMP, NYT has employeed expert professional design engineers and RMP experts to ensure all necessary design and program elements are addressed.  The RMP program will include written procedeures for all RMP elements, including process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, operator training, management of change, pre-startup safety review, employee participation, hot work permit program, incident investigation program, contractor safety, and emergency response.  The process design includes several important safety features, including ammonia detectors with interlocks, high level alarms and interlocks, emergency shutdown switches, fire monitors, and misting stations.  \n\nThe facility has had no accidental releases of the regulated materials.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nNYT has a written emergency response plan.  The emergency response plan has been coordinated with the City of Elizabeth LEPC and the US Coast Guard.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for internal and external emergency notification, evacuation, and emergency response.  Under OPA90, NYT performs routine emergency respose drills to exercise the emergency response plan.   Annual emergency response drills specific to anhydrous ammonia and/or aqueous ammonia will performed."
