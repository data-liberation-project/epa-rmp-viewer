All operators are mandated to complete chlorine and sulfur dioxide emergency response training within the first year on the job. Refresher courses are offered both locally and through the local member association of the Water Environment Federation as well as state training offices in both Idaho and Washington. Safety reviews are conducted locally several times per year. Emergency equipment is well maintained and regularly exercised.\n\nTHE FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe City's AWTP is located on the Spokane River about 0.5 miles downstream of the outlet of Coeur d'Alene Lake. It is located adjacent to North Idaho College's parking lot and to the City-owned Harbor Center office building.\n\nThe AWTP currently treats a summer peak wastewater flow of 3.8 million gallons per day (mgd) and is designed for 5.0 mgd. It currently serves a municipal population of approximately 52,500. It utilizes the following liquid stream processes:\n\n\u0095\tScreening, pre-aeration and grit removal\n\u0095\tPrimary clarification\n\u0095\tPlastic media trickling filters for secondary treatment in conjunction with solids re-aeration and solids contact for secondary treatment\n\u0095\tSecondary clarification\n\u0095\tTertiary ultra-filtration membrane treatment\n\u0095\tChlorine solution disinfection followed by sulfur dioxide solution neutralization of the excess chlori"

Up to 8,000 pounds of chlorine and 6,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide can be on-site in storage at any one time. The City of Coeur d'Alene's Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWTP) is staffed 8 hours per day and 7 days per week. One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine (under pressure) furnish the necessary gas for mixing with water as a disinfectant to the AWTP's effluent. Just prior to the effluent's discharge to the Spokane River, a solution of water and sulfur dioxide is added to neutralize the excess chlorine. Sulfur dioxide is stored likewise in one-ton cylinders for dispensing.\n\nTwo operators are always present during the transfer of cylinders to and from storage.\n\nThe storage and dispensing areas are in a sealed building of masonry construction. The storage areas are treated as confined space entry areas. Advance entry permits are required before entry.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe city's AWTP operates under several sets of regulations. The following govern to plant:\n\n\tState of Idaho - Industrial Commission\n\tEPA - Clean Water Act\n\tState of Idaho - Department of Environmental Quality\n\tState of Idaho - SERC\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is based on a release outside of the storage facility. The city assigns 2 operators whenever moving chemical cylinders into storage. Electric hoists with fail safe devices are used to lift the cylinders. No manual labor is required. The hoists are inspected and certified annually.\n\nThe chemical feed equipment including the cylinders"

SCBAs are rotated through the fire department annually.\n\nAll operators receive annual training in chlorine and sulfur dioxide safety including transport, use, leak detection and emergency leak response including leak repair. Management annually reviews the chemical supplier's cylinders for inspection and certification.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of either chlorine or sulfur dioxide in at least the past 13 years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe city's fire department is the designated first responder for any accidental chemical releases. The AWTP's operators will also respond, but as secondary responders. The fire department will act as the incident commander. Law enforcement can be deployed as needed. HAZMAT teams are available locally in the city through Kootenai County Fire District # 1. Other HAZMAT teams are available in Spokane, WA - 33 miles away.\n\nThe city is a member of, and participates in, Kootenai County's Emergency Operations Plan administered through its Disaster Services Bureau. Drills are conducted jointly with the county and other agencies. \n\nThe plant has an emergency response plan for chemical emergencies adopted in February 1998. It is a part of the plant's O & M manual and is readily available.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nIn a recent facility plan by our consulting engineers, the chlorination/dechlorination processes have been reviewed and are planned for removal within the next decade. Anti-intrusion alarms for the chemical storage rooms were added in 2006 and security cameras were added in 2019."
