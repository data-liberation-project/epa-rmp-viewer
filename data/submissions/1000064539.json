As part of complying with the Risk Management Program Rule, NorthStar Chemicals (NorthStar) is continually renewing and enhancing accidental release procedures and emergency response policies. These policies have been incorporated into the facility's Consolidated Emergency Response Plan.  Chemical safety is a core company value with plant management committed to safety and the implementation of safe operating procedures. \n\n\n\nNorthStar manufactures adhesive products.  Operations include mixing, packaging, and storage of primarily solvent-based adhesives.  There are four flammable substances at the NorthStar facility that are regulated by the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions defined at 40 CFR 68. The four chemicals are considered a flammable mixture covered under Process 1.  The maximum amount of flammable mixture stored onsite is approximately 129,000 pounds.  Specific information for each chemical in the flammable mixture is as follows:\n\n\n\n- Methyl ether: A propellant added during packaging operations in the adhesive preparation process. The maximum amount of stored onsite is approximately 67,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n- Isobutane: A propellant added during packaging operations in the adhesive preparation process. The maximum amount of stored onsite is approximately 17,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n- Propane: A propellant added during packaging operations in the adhesive preparation process. The maximum amount of stored onsite is approximately 19,000 pounds. \n\n\n\n- Pentane: A solvent used in the adhesive preparation process. The maximum amount of stored onsite is approximately 26,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nThere are no toxic substances present at the facility in amounts greater than the threshold quantities per 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nTo address potential accidental releases, an accidental release prevention program along with chemical-specific prevention steps has been developed.
