If this location cannot be used the alternative location will be the London Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n\nThe  average rate of air change per hour (acph) in average American homes and office-type buildings under average conditions is 0.8 to 1.0 acph with doors and windows closed and ventilations systems closed down. \"Leaky\" buildings or average buildings exposed to severe weather conditions, with air change rates of 1.5 to 2.5 acph, may experience 45 to 65 percent of outdoor concentration in 30 mintues. If a structure is exposed to a hazardous concentration for an extended period of time, the chemical concentration inside the structure may approach the outside concentration. Therefore, in-place sheltering is generally applicable for release of short duration (30 minute or less) and may have limited application for releases over a period of time in excess of one hour.\n\nThe local radio and television stations will be used to notify residences to stay inside and turn off all air conditioners, heat pumps, and all outside ventilation. The local law enforcement agencies, local fire departments and rescue departments will be ask to assist in notification of residences inside the effected area.\n\nThe evacuations routes that may be used from the immediate area are East on Waterworks Road to Parker Road, then North or South on Parker Road.\n\nIn the event of a large or long term release of chlorine people in the effected area will be notified to evacuate their homes until the problem is corrected.\n\nEvacuation orders will be given by the emergency response coordinator and all evacuations will be a joint effort by the emergency agencies.\n\nThe local radio and television stations will be used to notify the residences in the effected areas.

This will slow down the amount of leakage into the atmosphere. Authorized personnel will attempt to shut off or repair chemical using safety equipment and repair kit.\n\nTo find a Chlorine leak, tie a rag on a stick, and dip rag into some 20 degree Baume' Ammonia and hold it near the suspected leak. White fumes will indicate the exact location of the leak.\n\nNEVER PUT WATER ON A CHLORINE LEAK. The mixture of water and Chlorine will increase the rate of corrosion of the container and make the leak larger. If Chlorine gas from a leaking container can be used in the operating system, the pressure in the container can be lowered and the leak will be less serious. If the operating system cannot use it fast enough, the Chlorine should be passed into a alkaline solution, which will absorb it. Such solutions can be made using Caustic Soda or Soda Ash mixed with water. The Chlorine should be passed into the Alkaline Solution near the bottom of the container, through iron pipe or weighted rubber hose. Either Caustic Soda or Soda Ash, along with a suitable container to hold the solution, must be kept near the Chlorine unloading areas, ready for instant use.\n\nAfter leak is controlled clean up may consist of the cleaning of all fixtures and the replacement of damaged fixtures, for corrosion control.\n\nThe London Utility Comm"
