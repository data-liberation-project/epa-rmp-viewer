[DCPC] is strongly committed to employee and public safety and environmental compliance.  Our comprehensive accidental release prevention program encompasses areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  We implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.  Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nDCPC is a leading manufacturer of aerosol propellants and refrigerant gases.  The facility receives chemicals in tank trucks and rail cars that are offloaded into various storage tanks.  The chemicals are processed through molecular sieve columns and mercury removal units, if necessary, to higher purity levels and specifications.  Chemicals may be metered and blended to customer specifications, if required.  Outbound shipments are sent via tank trucks or rail cars.\r\n\r\nThe following 5 regulated [flammables] chemicals are present at the Anaheim facility: \r\nPropane, n-Butane, Isobutane, Difluoroethane and Dimethyl Ether [DME, also known as Methyl Ether].  \r\n\r\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nOur facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR Part 68.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nThe facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, 1967 Edition.  DCPC maintains detailed records of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, equipment designs and specifications associated with all processes.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities at the plant, DCPC maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nDCPC has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\nDCPC conducts maintenance inspections, repairs and replacements on process equipment which includes pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified and trained personnel.  Furthermore, these personnel are provided specialized training, as needed.  \r\nInspection and testing procedures follow Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices [RAGAGEP], e.g. applicable NFPA, ASME and API standards and manufacturers' recommendations.  Records are kept for all inspections at appropriate frequencies, breakdowns, repairs and replacement of equipment and tests to evaluate reliability.\r\nDeficiencies identified by the maintenance inspections are corrected in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\nWritten procedures are in place at DCPC to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and proced"

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\r\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and modifications are conducted routinely at DCPC.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\nDCPC conducts audits on a scheduled basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The USEPA RMP regulations require Compliance Audits on a Triennial basis [once every three years].  Corresponding corrective actions, if necessary, are promptly undertaken and completed.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\nDCPC has robust incident investigation procedures in place for events that result in, or has the potential for a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations would identify the situation leading to the incident as well as corrective actions to prevent future recurrence.  Policies are in place for all reports to be retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\nDCPC firmly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning safety and accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, DCPC employees have access to all applicable elements of Process Safety Management information, created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses [PHAs].\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\nDCPC issues hot work permits for hot work operations conducted on or near a covered process.

Prior to selection, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  DCPC has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency events.\r\n\r\n4.  Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nDCPC has maintained an excellent record of no accidental releases over the past 5 years.  \r\n\r\n5.
