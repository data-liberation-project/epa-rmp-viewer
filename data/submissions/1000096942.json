Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt Nalco Company, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning to help ensure the protection of the environment, the safety of our employees, and the safety of the general public.  As founding members of the local Community Advisory Group, we firmly believe in that we must consider community concerns when conducting our business.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented to protect the public, including:\n\n\n\n- A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n- An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP Rule\n\n- An overview of our emergency response program\n\n- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nNalco Company is the largest provider of water treatment and process chemicals, services and systems in the world.  Our facility produces these chemicals using a variety of raw materials and process operations.  We use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\nToxic Chemicals\n\n- Epichlorohydrin is reacted with dimethylamine to make polymers used in the paper industry.\n\n\n\nFlammable Chemicals\n\n- An aqueous solution of 60% dimethylamine is reacted with epichlorohydrin to make polymers used in the paper industry.\n\n\n\n3.

Five Year Accident History\n\nWe keep records of accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  In the past five years, we have not had any accidents involving an RMP covered process that resulted in death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, significant property damage, or environmental damage.  For any accident of this nature, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of the event.\n\n\n\n5.
