This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that includes procedures for the operation, maintenance, emergency response, and employee training associated with the regulated process at this facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances and adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\r\nThe regulated substance present at the facility is vinyl acetate.  The vinyl acetate is stored for use by local industry. The maximum inventory of vinyl acetate stored at Ergon - Baton Rouge, Inc. is 17,993,884 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario, were evaluated by using the RMP*Comp program and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios as required by 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.1 - 68.33.\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario for regulated toxic gases involves the ground-level release of the entire contents of the largest vessel at the facility over a ten minute period.  In the worst-case situation, this type of release would coincide with meteorological conditions that result in minimal dilution of the vessel contents. The endpoint for toxic substances is the maximum airborne concentration below which nearly all individuals can be exposed for up to one hour without developing serious health effects which could impair the ability to take protective cover.

The distance to endpoint was determined using RMP*Comp, a software program developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\r\n\r\nThe Worst-Case Release Scenario for Ergon - Baton Rouge, Inc. involves the release of vinyl acetate from the 55,000 barrel storage tank.  The distance to endpoint for this release is approximately 6.2 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Release Scenario is an event which is much more likely to occur than the Worst-Case Release Scenario and which will reach an endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. In determining the distance to endpoint for the Alternative Release Scenario, any mitigation controls employed in the process can be used.  The distance to endpoint for the Alternative Release Scenario was determined using RMP*Comp.\r\n\r\nThe most likely Alternative Release Scenario for Ergon - Baton Rouge, Inc. would involve a release from the hose that attaches to the barge for unloading vinyl acetate.  A check valve exists at the connection to the pipeline that prevents backflow of vinyl acetate should the hose lose its attachment.  This Alternative Release Scenario could result in the release of a maximum of 110 gallons of vinyl acetate.  The distance to toxic endpoint calculated by RMP*Comp for this release is approximately one tenth of a mile.\r\n\r\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Ergon facility is in compliance with EPA's Accident Release Prevention Rule set out under 40 CFR Part 68 and all applicable state codes and regulations.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\n\r\nSafety Information\r\nErgon - Baton Rouge, Inc. maintains the applicable Safety Data Sheets related to this process.   The facility also maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs ass"

The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel who are experienced in engineering and process operations.  The reviews are updated every five years or whenever a major change in the process occurs.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nIn order to ensure safe operation of the covered process, Ergon - Baton Rouge, Inc. maintains written standard operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is reviewed periodically, certified annually, and readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nErgon - Baton Rouge, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating this process are competent in the operating procedures associated with this process.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\nErgon - Baton Rouge, Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks to maintain the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.
