Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\n3A Composites is a manufacturing facility located in Statesville, North Carolina. As a result of the polystyrene foam manufacturing process, isopentane is stored at the facility in quantities that exceed the 10,000 pound threshold quantity specified by the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation. The facility has one covered process that is subject to Program Level 2 requirements under the EPA RMP regulation. 3A Composites maintains an underground storage tank of isopentane, which is used in the production of polystyrene foam products. \r\n\r\n3A Composites is not subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) per the exemption allowed in 29 CFR 1910.119(a)(1)(ii)(B) which provides exceptions for flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks or transferred which are kept below their normal boiling point without the benefit of chilling or refrigeration.  The isopentane storage tank is atmospheric and due to recent process changes to pump design, the tank nor vapor return lines are aided by cooling or refrigeration to maintain temperatures below the normal boiling point.\r\n\r\nIsopentane is delivered to the facility via tank truck. The tank truck is unloaded into an underground storage tank using gravity flow.  A vapor recovery system prevents the release of isopentane vapors to the atmosphere during the transfer. Isopentane is pumped from the storage tank to the pump room where the pressure is increased so it can be injected into one of the two extruders.\r\n\r\nSince the original 1999 RMP submission, the facility has been issued a Title V permit.\r\n\r\nB. Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policies of 3A Composites\r\n\r\n3A Composites is committed to protecting facility personnel, the public and the environment from any workplace and accidental release hazards.  Appropriate responses to releases of regulated chemicals are documented in the Plant Safety Manual (i."

Safety, environmental protection, and RMP plans programs are implemented and coordinated with Iredell Emergency Management for emergency planning and response efforts.\r\n\r\nC. Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\n3A Composites had one accidental release of isopentane in the past five years. The release resulted in a fire onsite and subsequent death of a contractor. There were no additional injuries. \r\n\r\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe 3A Composites' facility complies with the RMP regulation requirements for its Program 2 covered process. The facility also complies with all applicable state and local codes and regulations.\r\n\r\nE. Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEmployees at the 3A Composites' facility will only respond to incidental releases of isopentane where the release can be absorbed, neutralized, or otherwise controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel. For non-incidental releases 3A Composites will rely on outside responders, therefore, they do not have to comply with OSHA 1910.120 and do not have to develop an Emergency Response Program under 40 CFR 68.95. \r\n\r\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\n3A Composites believes that the existing Incident Plans are adequate."
