      "SummaryText": "JASPER WATER WORKS TREATMENT PLANT\n\nRMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFacility Description\n\nThe Jasper Water Treatment Plant (WTP) treats water from the Mulberry Fork of the Warrior River to provide drinking water for the city of Jasper, Alabama and surrounding areas.  The plant?s capacity is 18 million gallons of water per day and on a normal day it treats about 10 million gallons of water.  The final treatment operation in the plant involves injection of chlorine into the treated water to kill any pathogens present and to provide a chlorine residual that will kill any pathogens that may be present in the water distribution system.\n\nChlorine used for this disinfection is stored as a liquid under pressure in one-ton cylinders.  The cylinders are stored in a concrete, cinder block, and steel chemical feed room within the water treatment building.  When connected to the process, chlorine is withdrawn from a cylinder using a slight vacuum and it is immediately dissolved into a slipstream of the treated water.  This chlorine water is then mixed with the entire plant water flow to achieve the desired residual concentration.  The WTP may have as many as eight one-ton cylinders of chlorine on site at any one time.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Jasper Waterworks and Sewer Board (JWWSB) is committed to absolutely preventing harmful releases of chlorine from the WTP.  This commitment is demonstrated by the level of regular training provided to water plant operators and by the routine contract maintenance of all elements of the chlorine gas system.\n\nThe JWWSB is also committed to incorporating industry standard good practice into its emergency response practices for the WTP.  To this end, the JWWSB is updating its emergency response program so that it will provide timely, coordinated response to any and all potentially harmful releases of chlorine.  The model being used for the update is an industry standard prepared by the Chlorine Institute.  When "

      "SummaryText": "fully implemented, the program will provide the best practical measures to protect the community from large-scale releases.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe first element of the accidental release program involves the design and construction of the chlorine storage and delivery system.  Chlorine Institute standards and good engineering practice were used in these designs.\n\nAnother important element of the plant?s accidental release prevention program is maintenance of gas systems.  Silver Sales, which is a regional supplier of operating and maintenance services for gas storage and injection equipment, currently provides yearly review of the gas systems.  They test the critical components and maintain all the equipment in good working condition.  The plant, through Silver Sales, currently replaces all the gaseous tubing in the system yearly and replaces the rigid gas piping every three years.  Silver Sales also keeps plant personnel updated on newer technologies and equipment being used for the type of gas systems in the WTP.  Dixie Crane inspects the hoists used to lift gas cylinders from the delivery truck and move them into storage positions in the chemical feed building.  This inspection is done yearly.  If any deficiencies or concerns are noted during the inspection, they are immediately addressed.\n\nTraining is the third major element in the plant?s release prevention program.  Only trained personnel are allowed to perform any activity related to use of chlorine including unloading gas cylinders, connecting cylinders to the process, operating the gas injection processes, or disconnecting empty cylinders for the process.  Harcross Chemicals Incorporated, which is the WTP?s supplier of chlorine, provides this training every two to three years.  Training consists of eight hours of classroom lecture and hands-on demonstration.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nThe WTP has experienced no harmful accidental releases of chlorine in the five year prior to this upd"

      "SummaryText": "ate.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe WTP emergency response plan follows the outline in Pamphlet 64 ?Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities? published by the Chlorine Institute.  It contains guidance and methodology for planning for a release emergency.  This includes duties and responsibilities for plant personnel and for outside responders.  It contains instruction for internal and external communications.  It identifies emergency response equipment at the WTP.  It gives clear instructions about evacuation procedures and post emergency restoration procedures.\n\nIn the event that outside response agencies are required, the emergency response plan identifies agencies whose assistance may be required and it gives instruction about coordinating response efforts with those agencies.  The plan instructs how to communicate with the media and the general public.  Finally, the response plan has detailed instructions about reporting incidents to required local, state, and federal agencies.\n\nPlanned Changes\n\nThe operating procedures for the WTP have not been reviewed recently.  These will be reviewed and updated as necessary to assure that they accurately reflect the chlorine components and practices currently in use at the plant.  Other changes may be identified as a result of periodic hazard analyses.  If safety deficiencies are identified during one of these analyses, they will be remedied without delay."
