Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential hazard controls in place to manage these hazards, and recommend additional controls, as appropriate.  The Canadian Valley Gas Plant uses a What-If Analysis that is conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates potential hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures. \n\n\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) team findings are forwarded to local management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings are based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. The approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  The facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA's and PHA revalidations.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help determine that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Canadian Valley Gas Plant periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate in these audits. Any audit findings are developed by the audit team and forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nProcesses at the Canadian Valley Gas Plant involve hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation.

      "SummaryText": "iption of the existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances at the facility.\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Canadian Valley Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failure and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Canadian Valley Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help:\n\n     (1) contain/control a release\n\n     (2) quickly detect a release, and\n\n     (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.\n\n\n\nThe following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n     1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\n\n\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n\n     1. Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n     2. Automated and manual valves to permit isolation of the process\n\n     3. Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high  temperature)\n\n     4. Curbing and/or diking to contain liquid releases\n\n     5. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system)\n\n     6. Atmospheric relief devices\n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1.    Personnel trained in emergency action.\n\n2.    Fire extinguishing equipment.\n\n3.    Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing)\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Canadian Valley Gas Plant is a new gas plant with operations planned to begin in January 2014 and therefore there is no accident history.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Canadian Valley Gas Plant maintains a written emergency action plan which is in place to help protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for"

      "SummaryText": " exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions, which address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training on these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency duties. The emergency action plan is updated when necessary based on modifications made to processes or other Canadian Valley Gas Plant facilities. The emergency action plan changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Canadian Valley Gas Plant has been coordinated with the Canadian County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Canadian Valley Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department, Police and Sheriff's office).  This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Canadian Valley Gas Plant conducts emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Canadian Valley Gas Plant resolves findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process. Since the plant is new there are no current changes planned.\n\n"
