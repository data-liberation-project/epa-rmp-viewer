Executive Summary \n\nVerso Paper owns and operates the Quinnesec Mill, an integrated pulp and paper facility located approximately 2 miles east of Quinnesec, Michigan. The Quinnesec Mill is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for employees, the public, and the environment. As a demonstration of that commitment, Verso Paper has developed and implemented Environmental, Health and Safety Policies to serve as guiding principles for all of it's employees and operations. Following these policies is the responsibility of every employee. \n\nAs part of this commitment, a system has been established to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Quinnesec Mill and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs\" (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Quinnesec Mill.\n\nThe risk management program consists of three elements;\n- A hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases including a history of accidents that have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of substances regulated by the RMP rule;\n- A prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance; and\n- An emergency response program to guide response to an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nInformation further describing thes"

      "SummaryText": "e elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the risk management program helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at the Quinnesec Mill.  In fact, a comprehensive safety program is in place establishing many levels of safeguards against release of a hazardous substance and injuries and damage from a release of a hazardous substance. \n\nHazardous substance uses are limited at the Quinnesec Mill.  Before using a hazardous substance, less hazardous alternatives are considered. Part of the RMP compliance philosophy has been the reduction of the use of hazardous substances covered under this regulation. When a hazardous substance is used, considerations are made for the potential for this substance to adversely affect mill employees, the public, and the environment and steps are taken to prevent any such effects.\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Quinnesec Mill is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The mill implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances.  These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes, and programs to evaluate hazards.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release emergency procedures are enacted to control and contain the release in a manner that will minimize potential injury to employees, the public or the environment.  The mill provides response training to employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department. The Quinnesec Mill maintains a Hazardous Materials Response team that is trained and equipped to respond to on-site chemical releases. Response act"

As part of this manufacturing process, regulated substances are handled in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  The RMP-covered substances are Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide.  \n\n1.3 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nThe Quinnesec Mill has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the mill formally implemented the 14 elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996 the EPA RMP rule established Program 3 prevention requirements which were subsequently implemented by the mill.\n\nProgram 3 is essentially the same as OSHA PSM, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.  Program 3 requires 12 of the 14 elements of the OSHA PSM regulation and is the most rigorous prevention program. It has been established for the Chlorine and Chlorine Dioxide Systems.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the prevention program that address the EPA RMP rule prevention program requirements. \n\n1.3.1  Program 3 Prevention Program\nThe Quinnesec Mill Program 3 prevention program consists of the following 12 elements:\n\n1.  Process Safety Information: The mill maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of the covered processes.  These documents address the physical properties of hazardous substances handled in these processes, the operating parameters of the equipment/process and the design basis and configuration of process equipment.  \n\nMaterial safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the properties of hazardous substances handled at the mill including regulated substances in covered processes.  Information on the technology and engineerin"

These documents are used to train employees, to perform process hazards analyses, and to help maintain the equipment.\n\n2.  Process Hazard Analysis:  The Quinnesec Mill performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process.  A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a leader with process hazard analyses experience is assembled to analyze the hazards of the process.  The hazard and operability (HAZOP) technique is used primarily, supplemented with checklists, to perform this analysis.  The PHA team prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to area personnel and, when appropriate, changes to enhance the safety of the process are implemented.\n\n3.  Operating Procedures: Mill operators, process engineers and supervisors work together to develop and maintain operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be safely performed.  The operating procedures are used to train employees and serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal operations and process upsets.\n\nOperating procedures have been developed and are maintained.  The procedures cover all phases of operations, including initial startup, normal operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, and startup following a shutdown.  The operating procedures are used both to help in operating the covered processes and as a training guide for both new and experienced operators.  Operating procedures are reviewed at least annu"

The training program includes both initial and refresher training that covers a general overview of the process, the properties and hazards of the substances in the process, and a detailed review of the process operating procedures and safe work practices.  Oral reviews and written tests are used to verify that an employee understands the process operation prior to job assignment.\n\nThe operators are consulted annually during operating procedure reviews to evaluate the effectiveness and need for additional training.  Recommendations from the operators are reviewed, and changes to the training program are implemented, as appropriate.\n\n5.  Mechanical Integrity:  Mechanical integrity of process equipment is maintained to help prevent equipment failures that could endanger employees, the public, or the environment.  This is accomplished by an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes, and utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\n6.  Management of Change:  The management of change program requires evaluation and approval of all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be reviewed through the management of change program.

Pre-startup Review:  A safety review of a new or modified process is performed before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.  This review confirms that an employee has completed the requisite training.  The review also confirms that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n8.  Compliance Audit:   Covered processes are audited to be certain that the prevention program is effectively addressing the safety issues for the covered processes.  An audit team is assembled that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate improvements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n9.  Incident Investigation:   An investigation is performed on incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented.  Employees are trained to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.

Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures, as well as access to information on the covered processes. \n\n11.  Hot Work Permits:  The Quinnesec Mill uses a hot work permit program to control spark or flame producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes.  The Hot Work Permit Form complies with OSHA's fire prevention and protection requirements in 29 CFR 1910.252(a).   Personnel performing hot work are required to have an approved permit prior to beginning their work.  Training in the use of the Hot Work Permit Form is included in the employee safe work practices orientation and refresher training is taken through computer based training periodically thereafter.\n\n12.  Contractors:  Contractor Guidelines for Safety and Health outline expectations related to contractor work at the Quinnesec Mill including work on the covered processes.  The program reviews the safety record of all contractors to help ensure that only contractors who can safely perform the desired job tasks are hired.  Contract supervisors and employees are informed of the hazards of the process on which they work, safe work practices, emergency response procedures, and utilizing a contractor work permit system.  Contractors' training documents and work performance are periodically reviewed to help ensure that safe practices are followed. \n\n1.3.2  Program 2 Prevention Program\nThe Quinnesec Mill has no processes which qualify for the Program 2 Prevention Program.\n\n1.3.3 Chemical-specific Prevention Steps\nIn addition to the required prevention program elements, additional safety features specific to the hazardous substances used at the Quinnesec Mill are described in the following paragraphs;\n\nChlorine Processes: Chlorine is fed through a short length of piping to an eductor, where it is safely absorbed i"

Our chlorine systems are located indoors within isolated room areas, which further reduces the potential for a chlorine release impacting the surrounding area.  Chlorine detectors and alarms are provided in areas where chlorine could be present if a release occurs.   These alarms sound at the chlorine room areas, and also on operator control displays, which are constantly monitored to help ensure quick response. \n\nChlorine Dioxide System: Chlorine dioxide gas is produced in the chlorine dioxide generator and piped to a water absorption column, where a 1.2 wt % chlorine dioxide solution is generated. Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Quinnesec Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to minimize the potential for serious incident or off-site impact.  The process is located almost entirely indoors, which further reduces the hazard.  Storage tanks are engineered specifically for chlorine dioxide service.  The process uses an advanced control system, with emergency shutdowns, to ensure safe operation.  Containment sewers and curbing are provided to minimize the extent of potential leaks. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring for chlorine dioxide in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\n\n1.4 Five-Year Accident History\n\nDuring the five year period prior to September 2011 there were no reportable incidents. The Quinnesec Mill is committed to maintaining a high level of safety performance.\n\n1.5 Emergency Response Programs\n\nA written emergency response program has been established to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.
