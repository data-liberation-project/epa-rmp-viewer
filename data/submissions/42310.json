EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSource and Process Description.\n\nThe main operation at New Orleans Cold Storage is the warehousing and distribution of frozen bulk foodstuff.  The facility\nconsists of several cold storage rooms that are cooled by a main refrigeration system.\n\nThe refrigeration system utilizes Anhydrous Ammonia (100% conc.) as the system refrigerant.  The main refrigeration unit\nhas a maximum capacity of 10,000 pounds of ammonia. \n\nSummary of Major Hazards.\n\nThe primary hazard associated with a release of Anhydrous Ammonia is exposure of persons and sensitive environmental\nareas to toxic levels of ammonia vapor.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a toxic gas that is also a corrosive irritant to eyes, skin,\nrespiratory tract and mucous membranes.  Contact of evaporating liquid with skin will freeze the tissue, then produce a\ncaustic burn.  However, the burn hazard should be considered secondary to the toxic effects from exposure to the gas.\n\nThe toxic endpoint for Anhydrous Ammonia has been determined to be 200 parts per million (ppm).  It is defined as the\nconcentration that almost all persons can withstand for one hour without permanent adverse effects.  However, aggravation\nof existing respiratory and skin diseases may occur at concentrations below the toxic endpoint.\n\nExplanation of How Releases are Prevented\n\nThe primary mitigation system for this facility is the Engine Room enclosure.  Although a catastrophic release would have\nample opportunity to be vented to the atmosphere, the engine room enclosure would provide a significant degree of isolation\nin the more likely release scenario.   An active countermeasure to any leaks or releases is the ammonia sensors in the\nengine room.  If ammonia is detected, an audible alarm is immediately sounded within the warehouse and an alert is sent\nto a 24 hour/day monitoring service.\n\nOther process controls include automatic cut-off devices in the event of deviation from prescribed limits (pressure,\ntemperature,"

This includes a daily inspection of compressors, pumps and associated\nequipment, and a weekly, monthly and annual inspection and maintenance schedule that is rigidly followed, ensuring a\nwell-maintained physical plant.\n\nAll operating procedures have been recently reviewed/revised and all personnel responsible for the proper operation of the\nrefrigeration units have received refresher training in the procedures.  These elements of this program will further reduce\nthe possibility of an accidental release caused by human error.\n\nSteps Taken to Address Hazards.\n\nThe primary methods for generating recommendations are through periodic review and/or revision of Process Hazard\nAnalyses (PHAs), incident investigations and operational procedures review (Management of Change). These reviews\nprovide a means for continuous improvement.\n\nAs an example, in response to a recommendation from an incident investigation report from another facility, two sets of\nimpervious body suits and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) are positioned at all NOCS facilities.  All engineers\nare trained in the use of this equipment as an enhanced way of personnel rescue, release response and rapid control.\n\nResponse Action in the Event of a Release.\n\nUpon initial discovery of a leak or release, whether by sensor and alarm or personnel, a rapid and decisive response is critical\nto minimizing the potential impacts to off-site populations and other sensitive areas.  As noted above, on-site control and\nmitigation, along with personnel evacuation and accountability, is coupled with a rapid notification plan to bring in local and\nstate agencies for assistance in the event the local population may potentially be affected.\n"
