Hazardous substances used in the production of fuel ethanol are managed according to applicable local, state and federal laws.  Pro-Corn, LLC regularly inspects and monitors the entire fuel ethanol production facility, specially the anhydrous ammonia system and the natural gasoline denaturant.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\nPro-Corn LLC (Pro-Corn) operates an ethanol production facility near Preston, Minnesota in Fillmore County.  The facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn in a dry mill process.  Dry distillers grains are produced as a by-product and is used as a livestock feed.  Pro-Corn is currently completing facility modifications that will approximately double their current ethanol production.  This facility modification does not change the current method of production.  The modification requires additional storage capacity of process chemicals.  The additional storage capacity exceeds the threshold quantities of six RMP listed substances.  Five of the listed chemicals are present in the denaturant, used to denature the final ethanol product.  The denaturant storage capacity is approximately 250,000 lbs includes the following chemicals; 1-butene, butane, isobutene, pentane and isopentane and the reported respective concentrations of 3%, 8%, 5%, 28% and 24%.  The facility modification has also triggered the storage capacity for anhydrous ammonia.  The new storage volume will be approximately 190,000 lbs.  \n\nRelease Scenarios and Preventative Administrative Controls\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires facilities to predict worst case and alternative release scenarios for listed RMP chemicals.  The worst case scenarios are generally defined as a complete release of the respective chemical over a period of 10 minutes.  The alternative release scenario generally involves the most likely re"

Using RMP CompTM , the off-site analysis of the worst case and alternative case scenarios for both anhydrous ammonia and the denaturant indicated off-site consequences.  \n\nPrevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nPro-Corn has complied with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  As a Program 3 facility, Pro-Corn maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan.  The PSM plan requires facilities to monitor covered processes through the gathering of process safety information, performing process hazard analysis, maintain and review operating procedures, provide employee training, verify and maintain mechanical integrity, utilize a management of change structure, complete a pre-start-up review, complete compliance audits, document incident investigations, maintain employee participation, maintain a hot work permit program and provide oversight and management of on-site contractors.\n\nFive Year Accident History\nPro-Corn, LLC has not had a natural gasoline denaturant or anhydrous ammonia accident causing death, injuries, or environmental impacts in the previous five years of operation.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nPro-Corn, LLC maintains an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) on-site.  The ICP directs Pro-Corn personnel on who to notify in the case of an emergency.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPro-Corn, LLC?s current facility modification includes the installation of automatic overflow and tank volume monitoring devices.  These devices will assist Pro-Corn in managing the chemical levels in order to minimize the occurrence of potential accidents."
