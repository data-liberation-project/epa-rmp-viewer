Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the fluid milk dairy facility.  The quantity stored exceeds the 10,000 pound TQ for ammonia, and is therefore regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  Foremost Farms contracted Northern Environmental to prepare a Risk Management Program for ammonia at the Marshfield facility.  The Risk Management Program consists of five elements:  the management system, hazard assessment, prevention program, emergency response, and the risk management plan (RMP) submittal.\n\nThe Foremost Farms-Marshfield management system lists Mr. Randy Paulson, Plant Manager, as having overall responsibility for implementation of the risk management program. Facility managers and supervisors assist the plant manager as delegated.\n\nThe hazard assessment included an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) and a summary of the 5-year accident history.  The OCA's worst-case release scenario was the loss of 2160 pounds of ammonia from the ice builder unit of the refrigeration system, resulting in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.8 miles. The OCA's selected alternative release scenario was a release of 2160 pounds of ammonia from the ice builder unit in 36 minutes,  resulting in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.07 miles.  According to 1990 Census data, there are a total of 904 persons within the worst-case vulnerable zone and 7 persons within the alternative release vulnerable zone.  Residences, schools, recreation areas, and commercial/office/industrial areas are located within the worst-case release vulnerable zone.  Residences and commercial/office/industrial areas are located within the alternative release vulnerable zone.  There have not been any accidents within the last five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nSince ammonia is also regulated under the"
