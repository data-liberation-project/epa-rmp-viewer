This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as mandatory technical and safety training for all facility personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. It is the policy of LCRA to implement reasonable controls to prevent releases of regulated substances.\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Winchester Power Park (WPP), located in Fayette County, Texas, consists of four simple cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbines.  These turbines will be used primarily during peak electricity demand. This remote peaking facility will normally be unoccupied and will be operated by employees located at LCRA\u00bfs Lost Pines Power Park. As a means of reducing nitrogen oxide emissions from the four gas-fired combustion turbines, aqueous ammonia is injected into the turbine exhaust streams. The ammonia concentration used in this process is less than 20 percent, which is below the threshold concentration in \u00a7 68.130. However, the site also includes an ammonia based inlet air chilling system to improve turbine efficiency. The chiller will have a storage capacity of 30,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, which is above the threshold quantity of substances under section 112\u00ae of the Clean Air Act.  A summary of the Program 2 Prevention Program is provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Winchester Power Park is subject to EPA's RMP rule codified at 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart C \u00bfProgram 2 Prevention Program. The accidental release prevention program at Winchester includes:\n\nSafety Information\nThe WPP has compiled and maintains safety information related to anhydrous ammonia.  These technical documents ensure that the process hazards are understood and that the plant is operated and maintained in a safe manner. These documents include Material Safety"

      "SummaryText": "Data Sheets, storage capacity in individual vessels, safe upper and lower operating limits, codes and standards used to design and build the chiller, and process equipment knowledge. This information is updated when changes are made to processes.\n\nHazard Review\nThe WPP has a comprehensive program to ensure that the hazards associated with the regulated process are systematically identified and controlled.  The analysis is conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, general industry standards, and guidance from safety organizations such as the Center for Chemical Process Safety.  The plant has a system in place to ensure that recommendations resulting from this analysis are resolved in a timely manner.\n\n\nOperating Procedures\nThe WPP maintains written operating procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including; initial startup, routine startup and shutdown, emergency shutdown, emergency operation, routine operation, and temporary operation. The procedures also detail safe upper and lower process limits, consequences of deviation from safe limits, and how to return the process to safe operation. The procedures are readily available to all operations personnel, and are reviewed and certified on a recurring basis.\n\nTraining\nOperations and maintenance personnel assigned to work at the WPP are located at the Lost Pines Power Park and visit the facility periodically to check its operation.  These personnel are initially trained in an overview of the ammonia delivery, storage, operation of the ammonia chiller, and the procedures to safely operate the process. Wholesale Power Services has a separate training group specifically tasked with identifying employee training requirements, development of training program objectives, maintaining training documentation and scheduling refresher training.\n\nMaintenance\nWritten procedures will be prepared for maintaining the mechanical integrity of the chiller process equipment, including ammonia tanks, c"

Maintenance procedures will follow a schedule that matches the manufacturer\u00bfs recommendation or as operating experience indicates is necessary.  Maintenance personnel also receive training in the process hazards and how to correct unsafe conditions.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTo ensure that the accidental release prevention program is functioning properly, LCRA will conduct a compliance audit of the prevention program requirements every three years.  The facility will quickly resolve any deficiencies noted by the audit team, and will review the audit report and corrective actions taken with all affected personnel.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWPP will promptly investigate all incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the catastrophic release of ammonia. The findings of the investigation, along with any corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence of the incident, will be reviewed with all affected personnel, including contractors as appropriate.  The investigation will be summarized in a written report, presented to plant management, and retained on site for at least five years.  The report will include incident findings, recommendations and actions taken in response to the investigation."
