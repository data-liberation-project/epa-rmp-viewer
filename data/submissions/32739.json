The Risk Management Program is based on the API Publication 761: \"Model Risk Management Plan Guidance for Exploration and Production Facilities.\"\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at Satanta Gas Plant are those included in the facility\u00bfs Emergency Response Manual and the facility\u00bfs PSM program. The Emergency Response Manual covers actions to be taken in case of an unplanned release. The mechanical integrity section of PSM discusses actions taken to prevent an unplanned accidental release of regulated substances.\n\nThe Satanta Gas Plant is a natural gas processing facility. The processing of the gas includes dehydration of the full gas stream followed by the removal of natural gas liquids, nitrogen and helium. The nitrogen removed is vented to the atmosphere. The helium recovered is compressed and transported via pipeline from the facility. The natural gas liquids, which consist of a mixture of ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes and hexanes, is transported via pipeline from the facility. The remaining gas, which consists mainly of methane, ethane and a small amount of propane and heavier components, is transported via pipeline from the facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program is outlined in the mechanical integrity section of the PSM program for the facility. Some of the main components of this section that would help prevent the accidental uncontrolled release of regulated substances include:  testing of critical control and shutdown instruments, testing of PSV\u00bfs and routine testing of piping and vessel corrosion.\n\nThere has not been a recordable / off-site accident in the previous five year history of this facility \n\nThe emergency response program for this facility is contained in the Emergency Response Manual, ERM. The ERM include actions to take in case of an uncontrolled release"

The proper action includes immediately contacting the Grant County Emergency Response system which in turn will contact other emergency response agencies to aid in controlling access to the facility by the public.\n\nThe facility has ongoing programs that help train personnel in areas that have the greatest potential for uncontrolled release of hazardous substances.  In addition to utilizing PSM for hazard assessment, safety training is done in which unsafe items are discussed and resolved."
