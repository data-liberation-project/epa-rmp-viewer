The unreacted VCM gas is recovered from the reactors for recycle. The PVC slurry is pumped to blowdown tanks, where additional unreacted VCM flashes overhead to be reclaimed by condensation. The blowdown tanks also serve as holding tanks for continuous feed of the slurry stripping columns Residual VCM is steam stripped from the PVC slurry in slurry stripping columns. Residual VCM is recovered from the equipment upstream of and including the slurry stripper. Condensed VCM is recycled to the process.\r\nThe stripped PVC slurry is then pumped through heat exchangers to dryer feed holding tanks and centrifuges, where the slurry is dewatered and the PVC wet cake is produced.
