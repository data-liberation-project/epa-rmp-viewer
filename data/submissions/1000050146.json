Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\n\n\nWe at the Grimmway Enterprises, Inc. Plant are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program and our process safety management program that addresses such critical safety issues as design, installation, operation procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the hazardous processes at our facility.  IT is our goal to implement appropriate control measures to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  \n\n\n\n2.   The Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Carrot processing and storage.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  Substance 1 is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used as a refrigerant in our plant. We have a total quantity of 84,132 lbs broken up into three smaller systems the first is Bldg. 1 with a total quantity of 22,495 lbs. The second is Bldg. 3 with a total of 39,955 lbs. The third system is Bldg. 4 with a total of 21,682 lbs. Substance 2 is Chlorine used for water treatment in our plant this substance is broken up into two systems the first is Bldg. 3 with 2,000 lbs. and the second is Bldg. 4 with 12,000 lbs. \n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 84,132 lbs.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 14,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:  \n\n\n\nTo evaluate worst-case scenarios, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equation, the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equation, and the RMP-COMP cal"
