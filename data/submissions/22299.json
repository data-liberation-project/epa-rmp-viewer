Accident Prevention Program.\n\nThe accident prevention program consists of the following elements:\n*Safety Information - MSDS are available and reviewed by all employees.\n*Hazard Review - New and old employees are shown potential hazards in the work place.\n*Operation Procedures - Each employee is shown how to operate equipment used to dispense chemicals.  This training lincludes hands on, demonstration, manual, and vendor catalogs.  Written procedures describe in detail what steps an operator must undertake in order to commence operations or terminate operations under all situations.\n*Training - Sessions are held on a quarterly basis to orient new employees and to provide review for other employees.\n*Maintenance - Guidelines have been developed for all dispensing equipment.\n*Compliance Audits - Inspections are conducted at 3-year intervals by qualified individuals familar with emergency situations.\n\n*Incident Investigation - Detail procedures have been established to determine the cause, results, and corrective actions that must be taken to prevent accidents.\n\nV.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\n     There have been no accidental releases in the last five years.\n\nVI.
