This facility complies the the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\n   Our ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves.  Our ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\n   Training is provided to all employees at minimum annually.  The training consists of classroom lectures, current videos, and hands-on demonstrations.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n   There was one release incident that occurred during April, 2003.
