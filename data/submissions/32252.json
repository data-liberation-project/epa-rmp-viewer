Anhydous ammonia is received by truck and rail, is stored on-site and is a regulated substance by the EPA requiring us to comply with the Risk Management Program.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n   The ammonia system is designed, installed, and is maintained in accordance with ASTM standards and the ASME codes.  This facility complies the the ANSI K 61.1 standards (1989), OSHA (29 CFR 1910.11), EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule as well as all applicable federal, state, and local codes and regulations.\n\n   Our ammonia system is protected from major releases by internal excess flow valves, check valves, relief valves, manual shutoffs, and emergency shutoff valves.  Our ammonia system is inspected on a regular basis with maintenance and preventive maintenance scheduled and documented.  Liquid and vapor valves, hoses, excess flow valves, gauges, and relief valves are replaced when necessary and/or according to the guidelines in the ANSI standards.\n\n   Training is provided to all employees at minimum annually.  The training consists of classroom lectures, current videos, and hands-on demonstrations.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n   There was one release incident that occurred during April, 2003.  All required agencies were notified immediately and the situation was handled promptly and according to current regulations.  No other incidents were noted during the last 5 years.\n\n"

The local fire department and the local LEPC are both aware of our handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\n   We do not plan to make any changes to the physical site in the immediate future.  We will continue to provide our employees with ongoing annual training to ensure that they are current with all the safe transfer and handling procedures, and provide regular inspection and maintenance on all the ammonia equipment.  Safety is our primary concern during daily operations."
