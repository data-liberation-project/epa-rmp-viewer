(Louisiana Pigment) is one of the world's newest titanium dioxide manufacturing plants, beginning production in April 1992.  The facility, located near Lake Charles, Louisiana, is comprised of a 40-acre \"state-of-the-art\" plantsite with an additional 100 acres used for parking, administrative offices, and storage of equipment and by-products.\n\nProduct Utilization\n\nLouisiana Pigment manufactures in excess of 100,000 metric tons per year of titanium dioxide by utilizing the chloride process.  Titanium dioxide is used in industry for generating brilliantly hued paints, in the manufacturing of primers and base coats, in automotive finishes, and in coatings for the exterior of buildings.  Beyond this , titanium dioxide can also be found in many additional types of materials such as high-quality papers, color plastics, furniture panels, textile fibers, glass, ink, porcelain, toothpaste, cosmetics, candy, food coloring, PVC, white side wall tires, and a growing list of others.  Most appliances and plastic packaging contain large quantities of titanium dioxide.  Plastics are transparent and acquire their gleaming whites and opacities through the addition of titanium dioxide.  Titanium dioxide also improves the physical properties of many plastics.  It absorbs ultraviolet light, making the material more resistant to weathering.\n\nManufacturing Process\n\nThe chloride process at Louisiana Pigment uses high grade titanium ores (natural rutile, titanium ores, or synthetic rutile) to recover the titanium dioxide (TiO2 ). This is done by first producing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4 ) as an intermediate product, oxidizing it to form TiO2 particles, and then washing the TiO2 particles to the purity required for further processing and finishing treatment. \n\nThe two steps which most characterize the chloride process are the continuous chlorination of ore in the fluidized bed and the continuous oxidation"

      "SummaryText": " of titanium tetrachloride in the gas phase to titanium dioxide using a burner.  These two steps are completely dependent upon each other since the chlorine released by oxidation is recycled to the chlorinator.  Through the use of analytical measurement and computer control technology, it is possible to optimize essential production variables, reduce down time to a minimum, and operate machinery at maximum safety standards.  On the premise that operating conditions are kept at an optimum for every step of the chloride process, 90-95% of the titanium dioxide contained in the original ore can be recovered and used in the end product.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990 added Section 112(r) to the CAA, which mandated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a regulatory program to prevent serious chemical accidents that may potentially affect public health and the environment. The resulting regulations referred to as EPA's Accident Prevention Program (Risk Management Planning), required certain companies, municipalities, and industries to provide information about potential risks associated with their operations. Louisiana Pigment assessed it operation and determined that titanium tetrachloride is stored at the facility in excess of the threshold quantity.\n\nLouisiana Pigment has made a commitment to our employees and community that we will endeavor to provide a safe workplace for our employees and to conduct our business as a responsible member of our surrounding community.  In keeping with this policy established at the inception of the facility, Louisiana Pigment has designed our \"Risk Management Program\" to address Process Safety and to extend this attention to risk management \"beyond our fence line\".  In accordance with OSHA 1910.119 (Process Safety Management), EPA's Accident Prevention (Risk Management Planning), and The Chemical Manufacturers Association's Responsible Care Initiative, the "

Louisiana Pigment is committed to the Responsible Care Guiding Principles:\n\n     To recognize and respond to community concerns about chemicals and our operations.\n     To make health, safety, and environmental considerations a priority in our planning for all existing and new plants and processes.\n     To operate our plants and processes in a manner that protects the environment and health and safety of our employees and the public.\n\nRisk Management is an interdisciplinary effort composed of Management Practices divided into four elements:\n\n         Management Leadership\n         Technology\n         Facilities\n         Personnel\n\nCollectively, these Practices encompass process safety from the design stage through operation, maintenance, and training.  Louisiana Pigment believes that adherence to the Management Practices provides for a continuous evaluation of our safety and environmental systems.\n\nLouisiana Pigment utilizes the elements of OSHA's PSM standard as the basis of our accidental release prevention program.  Underscoring the belief that all prevention activities begin with management leadership and are effectively conducted via employee participation, we have built and improved upon an incident prevention program that has resulted in continuous improvement of our overall incident rate.  Starting with sound incident investigation training, we have added a corrective action tracking data base that follows assignments of responsibility to insure completion of required actions.  Furthermore, we have increased emphasis on near miss reporting via an employee incentive program and began conducting cross-functional Job Task Observations that review the employee's task as well as the written procedure and the required safety precautions.

This crude titanium tetrachloride is then routed to an intermediate storage tank, Crude Titanium Tetrachloride Tank, prior to purification.  The volume of this tank is 68 cubic meters or 245,639 pounds of crude titanium tetrachloride when at full capacity.  This vessel is inside a building with a floor area of 16,136 square feet.  If this vessel failed, the contents of the vessel would be released and fill the floor of the building.  The release rate inside the building would be 4.744 pounds/minute (lbs/min) with a release rate out of the building of 474 lb/min.  This release would last 51.8 minutes and the toxic endpoint would be 9.3 miles.  This area would incorporate residences, industries, schools, a hospital, and recreational parks.  \n\n    Louisiana Pigment is a new facility built with \"state-of-the-art\" equipment.  The instrumentation on the piping to and from the tank fail in a closed position.  The titanium tetrachloride process in the CPI unit is monitored with camera tied to the control room that is manned 24-hours a day.  In addition, the building has a deluge system inside to control the vapors generated from the release, an emergency scrubbing system with vacuum hoses that can be used to intake vapors generated from the release to a pollution control device.  Once vapors our outside of the building, they are controlled by the Emergency Response Team (ERT) members by putting up a water curtain around the building and monitoring any potential off-site impact.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\n    The alternative release scenario at the Louisiana Pigment would involve the failure of any piping or equipment in titanium tetrachloride service.  At maximum rate, 22 metric tons per hour of titanium tetrachloride is produced/consumed in the chloride process.  Upon failure of any piping or equipment, the plant can be automatically shutdown within a maximum of three (3) minutes.  At 22 metric tons per hour (808.5 lb/"

This would encompass industry and some residences.\n\nThe equipment and piping is primarily inside a building structure and is at elevated temperatures.  In addition to the enclosure, the building contains a deluge system and vacuum hoses to an emergency scrubber to control the vapors from leaving the building.  Once outside the building, the ERT would put up a water curtain around the building.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nSince Louisiana Pigment began operation in 1992, we have incurred two incidents involving titanium tetrachloride which are included in the five-year accident history.  On June 9, 1999, an estimated 2204 pounds of titanium tetrachloride was released.  A shelter-in-place for the area was issued for less than one hour.  On June 15, 1999, an injury occurred when a small amount of titanium tetrachloride was released in the unit during maintenance activities.\n\nSummary\n\nLouisiana Pigment is one of the world's newest titanium dioxide manufacturing plants, beginning production in 1992.  The facility was designed and constructed using state-of-the-art technology for process control and employed environmental technology that meets and/or exceeds the regulatory requirements.   We have established internal systems to evaluate and improve our manufacturing process, environmental controls, and safety programs that provide for ownership and accountability. These policies and procedures, including the Risk Management Plan, is in place to ensure that we will continue to operate a facility while maintaining our commitment to our employees and community of an environmental and safe workplace \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
