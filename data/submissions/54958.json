      "SummaryText": "The Bardstown Wastewater Treatment Plant, located on 894 Gilkey Run Road in Bardstown, Kentucky, maintains active Risk Managmement Planning and Process Safety Management Programs.  It is the policy of this facility to maintain these programs to prevent the potential accidental release of chlorine and to activate an emergency response plan in the event of a chlorine release.  These plans are part of the facility's general accidental release prevention program.\n\nThis facility treats the city's wastewater using chlorine, a chemical covered by the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention and Risk Management Program.  Chlorine is delivered to and stored at the facility in high-pressure cylinders that contain up to 2,000 pounds of liquefied chlorine each when they are full.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant stores three containers (referred to as one-ton tanks).  The capacity of a ton container of chlorine is 2,000 pounds.  The tare weight of a ton container ranges from 1300 to 1650 pounds.  The gross weight of a ton container is 3300 to 3650 pounds.  Therefore, the maximum intended inventory for chlorine handled or stored on-site is approximately 6,000 pounds.     \n\nThis facility is subject to and has implemented the Occupational Safety and Health Agency's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Program as it applies to the handling of chlorine in the process equipment located at the facility.\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases at this facility over the past five years that have led to offsite impacts to people or the environment.\n\nThe City of Bardstown's Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has an Emergency Response Plan.  In the event of a release, all City of Bardstown WWTP personnel are to leave the area immediately for staging at a designated facility response point and notify 911.   The Emergency Response Plan will be activated.  This response plan has been coordinated with the LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Commission).  A public notification system has been developed.\n\nPla"
