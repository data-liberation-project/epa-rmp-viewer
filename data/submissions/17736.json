Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activities at the New Martinsville facility are the manufacture of polyurethane intermediates and iron oxide pigments.  The polyurethane intermediates include aromatic isocyanates like toluene diisocyanate and its precursors, dinitrotoluene and toluene diamine.  Polyether and polyester polyols are also produced.  The iron oxide pigments unit also produces aniline. The New Martinsville facility uses or stores eight of the RMP listed chemicals on the site as of June 21, 1999.  A nitric acid production unit, which had been in operation for the past 32 years, was shutdown prior to that date. Ammonia and nitric acid, which were used in that process and were addressed in the initial RMP evaluation activities, were not included in the first submission.  Ammonia, however, is being reinstated in this correction because of its use as a neutralizing agent in the mitigation system for phosgene. Hydrazine was also included i"

However, subsequent analysis of the process parameters found that the vapor pressure of hydrazine in the process never reaches 10 mm Hg, therefore it does not qualify as a covered process.  Of the eight chemicals covered, five are raw materials, one is an intermediate, one is a finished product, and one is a neutralizing agent for a safety system.  All eight chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the worst case scenario for the facility.  Phosgene was determined to be the worst case scenario chemical followed in order of potential off-site impact by ethylene oxide, chlorine, formaldehyde, ammonia, propylene oxide, ethylene diamine, and toluene dissocyanate.\n\n3.  Worst Case Scenario for the Facility\nThe worst case release scenario for the New Martinsville facility is the rupture of a phosgene solution vessel. Because of the low storage temperature and the solution concentration, the release to the atmosphere occurs through evaporation from a pool.   Using dispersion modeling (PHAST Software), this results in an endpoint distance  that reaches offsite receptors. This release assumes no mitigation other than containment in a dike.\n\n4.  Alternative Release Scenarios\nAlternative Scenarios were developed for all of the RMP chemicals. The alternative scenario for phosgene has the largest potential impact distance of the group. In this scenario it is assumed a leak of 50% phosgene solution develops from the phosgene solution feed system, and is released into the diked area.  However, mitigation limits the release of phosgene to the atmosphere.  Mitigation in this case includes immediate activation of the steam ammonia curtain, and isolation of the line and neutralization of the solution in the dike within 20 minutes.

Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nThe New Martinsville Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  Bayer is active in phosgene safety initiatives including a corporate phosgene safety committee, Bayer worldwide phosgene safety committee, and is an active member of the CMA Phosgene Safety Panel that deals with phosgene safety issues on an industry-wide basis.\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History\nThere have been no releases in the past five years that had off-site consequences.  A small phosgene release within the plant resulted in an OSHA Recordable Accident in 1996.  The release was less than one pound. There has never been any offsite impact from the New Martinsville facility resulting from the release of chemicals listed in the rule. \n\n7.  Facility Emergency Response Program\nThe New Martinsville facility Emergency Response System consists of volunteer emergency response teams scheduled on each rotating shift.  There are 128 emergency response team members.  They receive four hours on-site training monthly as well as off-site training in specialized subjects, such as fire fighting, rescue, incident command and Hazmat.  An E-Team organization provides secondary support and is staffed by Technical and Managerial Personnel.  The E-Team's main function is to assist and advise the Emergency Response Teams and communicate with outside agencies.  The plant belongs to an industrial mutual aid group called NORIMAC (Northern Ohio River Industrial Mutual Aid Council) that provides mutual aid between the various industries, government agencies, and service organizat"

Community warning sirens are placed in residential areas within 2 miles of the plant and have been in operation, as part of the CAER program, for more than fifteen years.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe RMP rule has provided a springboard to upgrade emergency response plans and  improve training for all of the hazardous chemicals listed.  The New Martinsville facility is implementing the incident command system for site emergencies, coordinating area emergency response plan improvements through the Marshall / Wetzel LEPC, and actively engaging in community dialog with groups, such as the Bayer & PPG Community Advisory Panel, to improve community understanding of the potential risks from the chemical plants. \n\nBayer has made a concerted effort to reduce the quantity of hazardous materials stored or handled at any one time.  The two most prominent examples are the elimination of chlorine railcars at the New Martinsville facility in 1991 by constructing a pipeline for gaseous chlorine from the neighboring PPG plant.  This minimized the total amount of chlorine available to be released and allows for quicker isolation and control in case of leaks.  The amount of phosgene on-site is also minimized by systems that make phosgene only as it is needed.  The lifetime of phosgene in the process is estimated at only twenty minutes.  Handling phosgene in solution further reduces the opportunity for high concentrations to be released in the event of small spills.\n\nAll of these activities are in concert with the principles of Responsible Care under which this facility and Bayer management operate."
