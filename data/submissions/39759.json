The facility has an emergency response program coordinated with LEPC, Fire Department, and Police Department depending upon the size of the leak, weather conditions, wind speeds and direction. If advanced level of technical assistance is deemed necessary to control leak, Chemtrec may be called to give advice and assistance via 24 hour emergency number. PB & S Chemical has a team that can be activated with a one hour notice 24 hours a day. A mock emergency response drill for chlorine loss has been conducted on site, where current response and emergency operations were utilized.\n\nF. We have in place a chlorine and sulfur dioxide emergency action and process safety management plan dated September 30,1997. No revisions have been found necessary at this time. Mock emergency drills proved the plan in place was efficient and thorough."

      "SummaryText": "A. The Lewisburg Wastewater Treatment plant (LWW) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. The LWW emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to the facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\nB. The LWW treatment system has been installed to disinfect the flow into the Lewisburg Wastewater System Plant located at 401 Woodside. The wastewater comes into LWW Plant, is treated, and flows out into Rock Creek. The treatment process includes the use of chlorine and sulfur dioxide. Both chlorine and sulfur dioxide are housed together in an enclosed building. The building contains three (3) ton cylinders of chlorine, and three (3) ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide. Various types of safety equipment, monitoring devices, and control devices are housed within the building, as well as access to safety equipment inside and outside the building. The facility is monitored eight (8) hours daily by on site personnel and on  omputer telemetry monitoring 24 hours, 7 days a week.\n\nC. The general LWW accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n     -High level of training of the operators\n     -Preventative maintenance programs\n     -Use of state-of-the- art process and safety equipment\n     -Use of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n     -Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n     -Implementation of an auditing and inspection program.\n     \nChemical specific prevention steps include availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), awareness of the  hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, as w"
