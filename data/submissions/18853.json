      "SummaryText": "ed Substances\n\n2.1 Facility Description\n\nThe Morris plant is located approximately 6 miles northeast of the city of Morris, IL, just south of Route 6 on Tabler Road in Grundy County.  The site comprises a total of 285 acres with the actual manufacturing facilities occupying 26 acres.  An additional 80 acres of the site is used for environmental treatment of waste water before it is discharge to Aux Sable Creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.\n\nThe plant, which began operating in 1973, employs 135 people and is a manufacturer of industrial chemicals, primarily cationic surfactants, derived from naturally occurring fats and oils.  The basic raw materials are tallow and grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil.  Additional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile and formaldehyde solutions.\n\nThe major processing units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation units, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit and a quaternization unit.\n\nThe fat splitter utilizes hot water and high pressure steam to convert the natural occurring fats and oils into organic fatty carboxylic acids and glycerin.  The glycerin is a by-product and is recovered and sold for further processing into soap and personal care products.\n\nThe fatty acids are transferred to the nitrile unit where they are reacted with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to form fatty nitrile.  The nitrile is then reacted with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst in either the continuous or batch hydrogenation units to form primary, secondary, and tertiary amines.  The addition of acrylonitrile or formaldehyde solutions can also be made in the batch hydrogenation units to form additional variations of secondary and tertiary amines.\n\nIn the quaternization unit tertiary amines are reacted with methyl chloride to form quaternary ammonium"

These intermediates and products are used as surfactants in agricultural products, personal care products, detergents and fabric softeners.  They are also used as surfactants in a wide range of other industrial processes including food, chemical, highway paving, metal processing, mining, petroleum, paint, ink, paper, pharmaceutical, rubber and polymer processing industries.\n\n2.2 Regulated Substances\n\nThe site has four substances that are covered by the Risk Management Plan regulations.  These substances are all raw materials and are acrylonitrile, ammonia, formaldehyde solutions and methyl chloride.  A fifth raw material, hydrogen, is listed in the regulations but it is not covered by the regulation at the site because the maximum quantity at the site is below the minimum threshold quantity listed in the regulation.\n\nThe maximum quantities of these materials in process at the plant site at anytime is as follows:\n\n    Acrylonitrile            421,000 lbs\n    Ammonia                348,000 lbs\n    Formaldehyde Solutions        361,000 lbs    (as 100% Formaldehyde 167,000 lbs)\n    Methyl Chloride            468,000 lbs\n\nThese quantities represent full storage tanks and one full delivery container.  Under normal operating conditions the quantity stored on site is approximately one half of the maximum quantities listed above.\n\n3. Consequence Analysis\n\n3.1 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe potential impact of the dispersion of the four chemicals listed in section 2.2 resulting from the rupture of the largest single vessel containing each of the chemicals was conducted using the OCA Guidance document and the RMP Comp dispersion model.  The generic weather data from the OCA Guidance Document was used.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the WCS for the site is a catastrophic rupture of a railcar containing 220,000 lbs of acrylonitrile.  The potential impact zone is defined by a cir"

Using census data, provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census on their Landview III CD ROM, the estimated population that could potentially be impacted by this release is 95,000 people.\n\nThe potential impact zone also contains a number of small communities, state parks and local historic sites.\n\n3.2 Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios as defined by the regulation were developed for each of the four regulated chemicals.  The scenarios were chosen based upon a review of prior accident history, Process Hazard Analysis results and maintenance history.  The requirement that the release have an offsite consequence was also a major consideration.  A team comprised of operating, maintenance, and engineering personnel conducted the review.\n\nThe ARS for each of the chemicals was defined as a split or sudden uncoupling of a transfer hose during unloading operations.  In the case of acrylonitrile, ammonia, and methyl chloride the action of an excess flow device was considered as a mitigating factor in limiting the release.  The release of formaldehyde solution is mitigated by the intervention of operation personnel.  As a result of this analysis an automated mitigating device is being engineered for the formaldehyde solution scenario.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for each of the Alternative Release Scenarios was developed using the dispersion modeling program SAFER( Trace and the Landview III census data.  The resulting analysis is as follows:\n    \nRegulated     Amount Released        Potential Impact         Potential Affected \nChemical    (lbs)            Zone Radius(mile)        Population\n\nAcrylonitrile    500                0.2                30\n\nAmmonia        190                0.4                50\n            \nFormaldehyde     26,800                1.0                210\nSolution\n\nMethyl Chloride    470                0.3                40\n\n\n\nThe formaldehyde solution has an additional potential to impact a local historic site and a neighboring chemical manufacturing facility.\n\n4.
