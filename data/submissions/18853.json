The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence and forwards these results to the site central safety committee for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees, including contractors, who could be affected.  Incident investigation reports are retained for 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHA re-validations.\n\n\n\n\n4.12 Compliance Audits\n\nThe purpose of the Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. internal audit procedure is to ensure that the site accident prevention program is functioning correctly.  It provides a means to document deficiencies and correct them. This evaluation is used to improve the design and effectiveness of the process safety management system and its implementation.  Compliance audits are performed at least once every three years.  The audit team includes at least one member who is knowledgeable in the process.  The team develops a findings report and forwards it to site management who promptly determine and document an appropriate course of action to resolve each of the findings.  Corrective actions taken in response to the findings are tracked until completion. The two most recent compliance audits are retained.\n\n4.13 Chemical Release Specific Prevention \n\nThe processes at Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\nSite wide video monitoring for release detection\nIncineration of specific process relief valves releases\nAutomatic isolation valves for specific processes\nAutomated shutdowns for systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high level, high temperature)\nDikes for toxic liquid storage tanks\nEmergency electrical backup for critical control and safety systems\nFire suppression and deluge systems for specific equipment\nTrained and fully equipped site emergency responders for chemical releases\nReal time simulation capabilities for accidental releases\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of the regulated chemicals that resulted in any death, injury or property damage on the Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. Morris site within the last five years.\n\nThere has never been a release of the regulated chemicals from the site that has resulted in an offsite consequence to the community or the environment.  An offsite consequence is considered to be death or injury to a member of the public, property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place or environmental damage.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nAkzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for a full response to a release of a regulated toxic substance and a limited response to the release of flammables.\nThe procedures address all aspects of emergency response including proper first aid and medical treatment, evacuation pla"

The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on changes made to the site processes or other facilities at the site.  Changes to the emergency response program are managed through the management of change process.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. has around the clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating a quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. conducts periodic drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations.\n\n  \n7. Planned changes to Improve Safety\n\nAkzo Nobel Chemicals Inc. constantly strives to improve safety of the site processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program and employee safety meetings.  The company resolves findings from the PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  The following types of changes are planned during the next 5 years:\n\n\tImprove spill control at hazardous raw materials unloading area\n\tAutomate emergency shutoffs at hazardous raw materials unloading\n\tInstall excess flow valve shutoff at formaldehyde solutions unloading area\n\tMinimize length of flexible hose used in unloading hazardous raw materials \n\tIncrease the n"

These substances are all raw materials and are acrylonitrile, ammonia, formaldehyde solutions and methyl chloride.  A fifth raw material, hydrogen, is listed in the regulations but it is not covered by the regulation at the site because the maximum quantity at the site is below the minimum threshold quantity listed in the regulation.\n\nThe maximum quantities of these materials in process at the plant site at anytime is as follows:\n\n\tAcrylonitrile\t\t\t421,000 lbs\n\tAmmonia\t\t\t\t348,000 lbs\n\tFormaldehyde Solutions\t\t361,000 lbs\t(as 100% Formaldehyde 167,000 lbs)\n\tMethyl Chloride\t\t\t468,000 lbs\n\nThese quantities represent full storage tanks and one full delivery container.  Under normal operating conditions the quantity stored on site is approximately one half of the maximum quantities listed above.\n\n3. Consequence Analysis\n\n3.1 Worst Case Scenario (WCS)\n\nThe potential impact of the dispersion of the four chemicals listed in section 2.2 resulting from the rupture of the largest single vessel containing each of the chemicals was conducted using the OCA Guidance document and the RMP Comp dispersion model.  The generic weather data from the OCA Guidance Document was used.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the WCS for the site is a catastrophic rupture of a railcar containing 220,000 lbs of acrylonitrile.  The potential impact zone is defined by a cir"

Using census data, provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census on their Landview III CD ROM, the estimated population that could potentially be impacted by this release is 95,000 people.\n\nThe potential impact zone also contains a number of small communities, state parks and local historic sites.\n\n3.2 Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios as defined by the regulation were developed for each of the four regulated chemicals.  The scenarios were chosen based upon a review of prior accident history, Process Hazard Analysis results and maintenance history.  The requirement that the release have an offsite consequence was also a major consideration.  A team comprised of operating, maintenance, and engineering personnel conducted the review.\n\nThe ARS for each of the chemicals was defined as a split or sudden uncoupling of a transfer hose during unloading operations.  In the case of acrylonitrile, ammonia, and methyl chloride the action of an excess flow device was considered as a mitigating factor in limiting the release.  The release of formaldehyde solution is mitigated by the intervention of operation personnel.  As a result of this analysis an automated mitigating device is being engineered for the formaldehyde solution scenario.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for each of the Alternative Release Scenarios was developed using the dispersion modeling program SAFER( Trace and the Landview III census data.  The resulting analysis is as follows:\n\t\nRegulated \tAmount Released\t\tPotential Impact \t\tPotential Affected \nChemical\t(lbs)\t\t\tZone Radius(mile)\t\tPopulation\n\nAcrylonitrile\t500\t\t\t\t0.2\t\t\t\t30\n\nAmmonia\t\t190\t\t\t\t0.4\t\t\t\t50\n\t\t\t\nFormaldehyde \t26,800\t\t\t\t1.0\t\t\t\t210\nSolution\n\nMethyl Chloride\t470\t\t\t\t0.3\t\t\t\t40\n\n\n\nThe formaldehyde solution has an additional potential to impact a local historic site and a neighboring chemical manufacturing facility.\n\n4.

The site comprises a total of 285 acres with the actual manufacturing facilities occupying 26 acres.  An additional 80 acres of the site is used for environmental treatment of waste water before it is discharge to Aux Sable Creek, a tributary of the Illinois River.\n\nThe plant, which began operating in 1973, employs 135 people and is a manufacturer of industrial chemicals, primarily cationic surfactants, derived from naturally occurring fats and oils.  The basic raw materials are tallow and grease, by-products of the meat packing industry, and vegetable oils including coconut oil and soybean oil.  Additional raw materials include ammonia, hydrogen, methyl chloride, acrylonitrile and formaldehyde solutions.\n\nThe major processing units at the site include a fat splitter, a nitrile unit, continuous and batch hydrogenation units, nitrile treatment, amine and fatty acid distillation units, amine esterification unit and a quaternization unit.\n\nThe fat splitter utilizes hot water and high pressure steam to convert the natural occurring fats and oils into organic fatty carboxylic acids and glycerin.  The glycerin is a by-product and is recovered and sold for further processing into soap and personal care products.\n\nThe fatty acids are transferred to the nitrile unit where they are reacted with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to form fatty nitrile.  The nitrile is then reacted with hydrogen in the presence of catalyst in either the continuous or batch hydrogenation units to form primary, secondary, and tertiary amines.  The addition of acrylonitrile or formaldehyde solutions can also be made in the batch hydrogenation units to form additional variations of secondary and tertiary amines.\n\nIn the quaternization unit tertiary amines are reacted with methyl chloride to form quaternary ammonium"
