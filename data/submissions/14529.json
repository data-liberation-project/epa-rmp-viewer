The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at A F AGRONOMY - ADAMS LOCATION:  AF AGRONOMY complies with ANSIK-61-1 requirements for anhydrous ammonia storage and it is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Adams, Ne. FIRE DEPARTMENT, and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  Adescription of our facility and the regulated substance handled:  The primary pourpose of this facility is storage of fertilizers for sale to the agricultural sector.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and autorized contractors.\n\n3.  The worst case release senario:  We used RMP COMP to determine the worst case scenario release at our facility.  failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount would have off site consequences. Excess flow check valves would aid in the shutdown of release through a ruptured transfer hose, manual shut off valves would be closed if possible to stop the release of vapor also.\n\n4.  this facility, AF AGRONOMY, at Adams, Ne. complies with epa's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  The facility has implemented the provisions of \"safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, k-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and he standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), 29CFR 1910.111, \"sTORAGE AND hANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\".\n\n5.  Five year accident history:  WE have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations"

Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the department have inspected our facility.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety:  Safety improvement is an on-going process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintainance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n                                                      RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nMANAGEMENT OF THE PROGRAM:\n\n(a.)  AF AGRONOMY  will develop a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.\n(b.)  AF AGRONOMY will assign a qualified person that has the overall responsibility for the development , implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements."
