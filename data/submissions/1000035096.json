The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The Community Water System Water Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Description of The Community Water System Water Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Community Water System Water Treatment Plant handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 150 pound cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n\n \n\nThe RMP Rule requires The Community Water System Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n \n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Community Water System Water Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies.

This plan is on record in the Office of Emergency Management, Cleburne County, Arkansas.  This plan identifies potential hazardous material storage sites within the county.  It establishes guidelines for response and coordination by all Emergency Personnel and Equipment, Law Enforcement, State, Federal Agencies and notification procedures. This document contains Hazardous Material Source, Emergency Response Team locations and phone numbers.  It also informs the user of the number of personnel available by location and the equipment they have operational.  \n\n\n\nCWS has included maps in the Emergency Response Plan which identify the Hazardous Material Source and the areas covered or involved should a release occur of any material that has been identified as Hazardous.  This type of information was developed for the evacuation of populated areas in the event of a major chemical or gas release. \n\n\n\nTo improve our existing safety program Community Water System requested that our insurance carrier provide an onsite review of all safety training and any potential problems or deficiencies in our program.
