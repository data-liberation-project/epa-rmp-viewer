      "SummaryText": "The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  This facility complies with NFPA 58 requirements for propane storage, which is mandated by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.  If an emergency were to occur, our policy requires that the Fire Department of Mount Joy will be notified and requested to respond.\n\nThis facility is a liquified petroluem gas terminal with bulk storage for both propane and butane.\n\nOur worst case scenario is a failure of one 90,000 gallong storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within the distance to endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a 25-foot long hose rupture caused by a truck pull-away that could  result in an explosion.   The resulting distance to the endpoint is onsite and no public receptors are affected.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicalbe state and local codes and regulations.  The propane system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA 58 and state laws.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our liquified petroleum terminal,  it is our policy to notify the Fire Department of Mount Joy and request that they respond to the emergency.  Members of the Fire Department visit our facility on a regular basis.  We communicate regularly with the Fire Department.\n\nThere are no planned changes to the safety program."
