The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia. Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur company has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of. Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: (1) prepared a unified program based on the PSM plan to meet CalARP obligations as well; (2) reorganized the program so that it meshes more closely with general FRESH SELECT business practices; and (3) reviewed plan documentation forms and responsibilities.  The unified Risk & Process Safety Management Plan sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n2.    DESCRIPTION OF AMMONIA SYSTEM\nThe Fresh Select facility is a commercial cold storage facility for deciduous tree fruit and citrus.  The facility has an ammonia system that provides refrigeration capacity to two storage rooms, one precooler, and a hydrocooler.  The rooms use A?bunker styleA? coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.  \n\nPart of the facility is a pumped liquid recirculator system and part of the facility is a flooded system.  The liquid recirculator system operates as follows.  High pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers is piped to a liquid recirculator through a liquid feed solenoid va"

From there, low pressure liquid is pumped to each cold room, where it passes through a solenoid valve, hand expansion valve and into evaporator coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas and overfeed liquid passes through regulators or check valves and is returned to the liquid recirculator.  The residual liquid is separated from the gas in the liquid recirculator and the gas is returned to the main suction accumulator.  From there the suction gas is piped to one reciprocating and four screw compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to a water cooled evaporative condenser where the high pressure ammonia gas is liquified and returned to the high pressure receiver.  Some of the high pressure liquid from the receivers is injected into the oil cooler on the screw compressors.  Excess liquid from the main suction accumulator drains into a liquid tranfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activate solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessel to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receiver.  The system uses water to defrost the coils.  \n\nThe flooded system operates as follows.  High pressure liquid from a high pressure receiver is piped to a liquid feed solenoid valve in the cold room where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the roof.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The rest of the flooded system operates the same as the liquid recirculator system.\n\nThere are four hydrocooler coils located in the hydrocoole"

From there it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted above the hydrocooler coils.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the hydrocooler coils.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessel, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the gas to the main suctin accumulator.\n \nThe Fresh Select facility was originally built more than 15 years ago and has been added to and modified several times over the years since then.  The facility was designed and installed by professional refrigeration engineers in accordance with industry standards at the time.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  \n    \nThe ammonia system at the Fresh Select facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, the main facility is treated as a single process.\n\n3.    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & AMMONIA SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems at the  FRESH SELECT facility are an integral part of the overall business.   The system contains a total charge of approximately 16,300 lbs. It is extremely important that it is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Manag"

FRESH SELECT has also conducted an off-site impact analysis of worst-case and alternate-case release scenarios for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.  The results of this analysis are reported in the body of the program.\n\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration system/process and keep an active journal of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the system/process is checked frequently by our outside refrigeration contractor, California Controlled Atmosphere, who also performs an annual pre-season preventative maintenance review of our system/process equipment. \n\nWe inform our employees of the dangers of an accidental release of ammonia in pre-season safety meetings.  New employees are made aware of the potential risk of ammonia in an employee orientation meeting.  During these meetings we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\n\n4.    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nFRESH SELECT has not had any reportable accidents within the last five years.\n\n5.    EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\nThis facilityA?s emergency response program is based on the Cal/OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (in California CCR Title 8, Section 3220, A?Emergency Action Plans.A?  Federally, Title 29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), HAZWOPER (standard (in California CCR Title 8, Section 5192, A?Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response,A? and Title 29 CFR 1910.120). \nStrategically, we will respond defensively to a release.  Under this plan our ammonia refrigeration personnel will take whatever steps are necessary to bring a release under control. The first priority will be to operate the ammonia system to bring a release under control safely, from a distance, without donning personal protective equipment.

All response activities would be done in coordination with the local fire department and the Tulare County Fire Department and the Hazardous Materials Response Team.\n\nEvery year at the beginning of the season we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including an ammonia release. \n\n6.    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Many policies and procedures have been implemented to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  Nevertheless, FRESH SELECT continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.  Preparation of this Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been the primary recent improvement, and implementation of the program is our plan for improved safety in the near future.\n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program has been written so that program elements are aligned with FRESH SELECT business practices rather than the order presented in the law.  Thus, Safe Operating Procedures are grouped together for the benefit of our system operator.  Safe Operating Policies are grouped together so that appropriate office staff may administer them.  The Emergency Action Plan is now separated out and distributed widely through the plant for easy reference.  \n\nThe Risk & Process Safety Management Program documentation forms and company policy forms pertaining to employee, contractor, and community safety have been carefully reviewed so as to prevent unnecessary complexity and redundancy.  Our operator assisted in the writing of Standard Operating Procedures, and they are presented in a format that is easy to use.  \n\nFor the future, FRESH SELECT now thinks of the Risk & Process Safety Management Program as a A?living documentA?.
