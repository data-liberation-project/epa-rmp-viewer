      "SummaryText": "SENSIENT COLORS LLC RMP EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFacility Overview\r\n\r\nSensient Colors LLC St. Louis manufacturing plant produces food, drug and cosmetic colorants; and technical dyes and pigments.  The facility includes chemical reactors, solid/liquid separation equipment, wastewater treatment equipment, and general plant utility systems.  This facility has not been subject to OSHA'a PSM rules based on materials handled.  Low volumes of flammable's are handled at this facility.  Based on the EPA RMP regulation, the St. Louis facility is subject to the RMP regulation due to the handling and usage of 20% oleum (20% sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid)above 10,000 lbs.  A thorough implementation of the RMP program has been conducted.\r\n\r\nRegulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe oleum stored inside the confines of the Sensient Colors Inc.'s St. Louis plant is contained in a 4,167-gallon storage tank at room temperature.  The storage tank is housed inside an isolation room that has restricted access.  A two-foot high curb inside the room will contain a spill of over 7,500 gallons and restricts the surface area of any spill to a pool of 510 square feet.  An exhaust system ventilates the room through a wet scrubber system and is designed to neutralize acid mists before being discharged through the scrubber stack.\r\n\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario for a toxic release of oleum at this plant involves the spill of the entire contents of the bulk storage (3,500 gallons).  The SO3 fumes would exhaust through the existing room ventilation system.  Dispersion of SO3 fumes was modeled using BREEZE HAZ DEGADIS+ software.  Using this software for the above scenario, it was determined that the toxic endpoint is 234.6 feet (0.04 miles), which is within the facility fence line and not impacting neighboring residents.\r\n\r\nAlternate Case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nSince the distance to endpoint of the woest-case scenario was within the facility fence line, and did not impact a public receptor,"

      "SummaryText": "an alternate case scenario was not required.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe Sensient Colors LLC St. Louis plant has not had any accidents within the past five years that required reporting.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Polices and Programs\r\n\r\nThe Sensient Colors LLC plant has written policies in addition to the mechanical systems that prevent the release of the toxic chemicals.  Policies are in place which govern chemical emergency response.  Each employee must review them at least once a year or when they are revised.\r\n\r\nFor oleum, any spill of material will be captured in the secondary containment dike.  Two oleum tanks are installed, and only one is used at a time.  Any spilled material would be pumped to the tank not in use.  \r\n\r\nThe emergency response documents control what will take place in the event of an emergency.  A chain of command is clearly outlined, responsibilities are stated for each group of employees and an evacuation procedure is defined.  Employees are informed of their individual duties such as where to be for a personnel count and when they may return to work or go home.  Steps to be taken for a specific emergencies are stated including who is to be notified and their telephone numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an oleum spill, the emergency response policy specifies the distances of evacuation for spills under 1 gallon and for spills of over 1 gallon.  The employee that discovers the spill will call security and notify them that an oleum spill has occurred, where the spill is and how much oleum has been spilled.  Supervision and management will be notified immmediately, and a company representative will report the spill to the local Fire Department, the Local Emergency Response Center, the State Emergency Response Center, the National Response Center, in the event that the spill reaches the public sewer, the St. Louis Metropolitan Sewer District.\r\n\r\nThe oleum spill response plan lists the chemical's physical and chemical pro"

The personal protective equipment needed to clean up a spill is listed as well as how to stop and contain the spill.  Finally the plan outlines the procedures for the clean-up and reclamation of the spilled oleum.\r\n\r\nDetailed written operating procedures are maintained for all batch processes.  Step-by-step instructions are given with special safety precautions highlighted.  Emergency, temporary, or ESD procedures do not apply to the batch process since all operating steps only proceed step-wise with ongoing checks of the conditions effecting safety.  All operations are ceased in the event that any unsafe conditions should arise.\r\n\r\nAdditionally with the implementation of the RMP, training has been initiated for operators, and maintenance personnel.  This supplements the existing contractor training programs.\r\n\r\nChemical Specific Prevention Programs\r\n\r\nSensient Colors LLC has performed analysis to determine the potential for an exothermic run-away reaction to develop.  Lab testing determined the thermodynamics at elevated temperatures of all reactions involving the use of Oleum do not create a run-away reaction.  \r\n\r\nThe Oleum storage tank and piping systems are routinely inspected to determine the wall thicknesses at several locations on the tank and critical points of the piping. This program provides assurance that tank and piping failure will not occur due to localized corrosion.  Records of all inspections are maintained on file by Sensient Colors LLC maintenance department."
