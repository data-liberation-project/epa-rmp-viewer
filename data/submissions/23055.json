SGJ's policy is to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations.\n\nTo manufacture these products SGJ uses a regulated raw material, 1,3-butadiene (butadiene). Butadiene is regulated because its flammable properties are similar to propane.\n\nSGJ understands the hazards associated with the use of butadiene and has an accidental release prevention plan in effect. This plan is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Plan. In its plan OSHA details training requirements for employees and precautions to be taken in manufacturing and maintenance of equipment when using hazardous materials.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program of SGJ is based on recommendations of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), \"Industrial Emergency Preparedness\" by Robert Kelly, the National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) and the American Petroleum Institution (API). The program contains procedures for contacting local, state and national response centers and for notifying areas that would be affected off site.\n\n\n2) The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance.\n\nSGJ receives 1,3-butadiene, a regulated substance used at this facility, by rail car and occasionally by tank truck. RRI has the equipment and trained personnel to safely unload rail cars and tank trucks.\nButadiene is stored in three (3) permanently located storage tanks. Two of the tanks are filled directly from rail cars or tank truck and the third is filled from the first two.\nNo butadiene is shipped from this site. Material received is used to make RRI's products.\nThe maximum amount of butadiene stored on site is 320,000 lb. \n\n\n3) The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative R"

      "SummaryText": "elease Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distance for Each Reported Scenario.\n\nWorst case scenario release would be the rupture of one of the large storage vessels. The assumption would be that all of butadiene contained in the tank would be released and the vapor cloud would find an ignition source. It is assumed that 10% of the released gas would participate in a vapor cloud explosion.\n\nAlternative scenario - A line failure while transferring from rail car to storage tank would release the content of the hose and some materials from the rail car. Excess flow valves, emergency shutoff valves and standard unloading procedures would limit the release. The unconfined vapor cloud would travel to the lower flammability limit end point of 45mg/L.\nThe distance to the end point is less than 264 ft. which could extend beyond the western boundary of the property.\n\n\n4) General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Specific Prevention Steps.\n\nSGJ complies with EPA Accidental Release Program and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. Affected employees have been trained in release prevention and response.\n\n\n5) Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases of butadiene that have affected an off-site receptor.\n\n6) The Emergency Response Program\n\nSGJ's Emergency Response Program is based on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Robert B. Kelly's \"Industrial Emergency Preparedness\" and the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) \"Emergency Response Manual for NFPA 472\". \nThese plans have been coordinated with the Grand Junction Fire Department (GJFD) and the Mesa County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). \nThe GJFD audits the facility for fire safety annually.\n\n7) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThis facility  installed in 1999 additional remote and automatic shut-off valves. SGJ will review and upgrade excess flow check valves and p"
