      "SummaryText": "The Minooka, IL Facility is a retail and fertilizer blending agricultural chemical facility that operates two (2) covered processes including Covered Process 1: Storage and Handling (Aqua Ammonia), and Covered Process 2: Base Blending.  Aqua ammonia is transported to the Facility via a commercial tanker truck (6,500 gallon) and then transferred to one (1) 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  The commercial tanker truck operator (Vendor/Contractor) performs these transfer operations.  \r\n\r\nHelena stores the aqua ammonia in the on-site aboveground storage tank and then transfers the aqua ammonia from the AST to the Base Blending operation.  (The Base Blending operation does not have the capability to store aqua ammonia.)  Helena performs this operation in accordance with its RMPr accident prevention program.  \r\n \r\nOFF-SITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOne (1) worst case consequence analysis was completed for both Covered Process 1 and 2, and an alternative case consequence analysis was completed for both Covered Processes 1 and 2.  The covered processes include Covered Process 1 (Storage and Handling - Aqua Ammonia), and Covered Process 2 (Base Blending).\r\n \r\nThe worst case scenario release for the Facility assumes that all the contents in the largest single storage tank are released.  For this Facility, the largest vessel is a 30,000-gallon aboveground storage tank.  The release was modeled as if the ammonia tank was punctured on the side at the ground level. The resulting release of aqua ammonia was modeled as an instantaneous release within diked containment.  In this scenario the aqua ammonia will evaporate over time at maximum temperature. \r\n\r\nThe alternative (or more likely to occur) scenario completed for Covered Process 1 and Covered Process 2 assumes to take form of a failure in the load-in piping for Covered Process 1 and the load-out piping for Covered Process 2, both of which are located within the containment area.  In these scenarios, the release goes un-n"

      "SummaryText": "The Helena Chemical Company (Helena) Minooka, IL  Facility has submitted this updated electronic RMP in compliance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act 112 (r) as codified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at 40 CFR Part 68. Standards codified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at 29 CFR 1910.119 are not applicable to the operations at this Facility because the Facility does not store and handle (Covered Process 1) or blend (Covered Process 2) an acutely hazardous substance (aqua ammonia) at concentrations above 44% as defined by these regulations.  However, the OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.111, are applicable and are included in the Risk Management Program (RMPr) document that is implemented by this Facility.\r\n\r\nThis electronic submittal provides conservative estimates of the offsite consequences of an accidental release of aqua ammonia from the Minooka, IL Facility located in the town of Minooka, IL at the intersection of South County Line Road and Route 52.  The physical address to the Facility is 60 Route 52, Minooka, IL 60447.  The electronic RMP summarizes the policies and procedures implemented by the Minooka, IL Facility to minimize the likelihood of an accident.  The electronic RMP also summarizes the actions that the Minooka, IL Facility has taken to ensure that a response to a release (even though a release is unlikely) will be implemented in a proper and timely manner.\r\n\r\nPURPOSE FOR UPDATING RMP\r\n\r\nHelena is submitting this as a Voluntary Update as the Minooka, IL Facility is newly acquired from the former owners of Hintzsche, Inc.  All relevant sections for a Program 2 RMP Facility have been reviewed and/or updated.  The updates are reflected in both the EPA RMP Submit report and the Facility Risk Management Plan Program Document (RMPr).  It is important to note that there are differences in the OCA distances and the total quantity of aqua ammonia stored and handled than as reported by the prior owner.  \r\n\r\nFACILITY"

      "SummaryText": "oticed until the entire surface area of the containment is covered to a depth of 1 inch.  Although these events are classified as an alternative scenarios, even accidents of this type are unlikely to occur due to the safety equipment (pneumatic actuated valves) and operating procedures that Helena uses to safeguard ammonia transfer operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe Operation Manager implements the risk management planning process at this Facility.  The Operation Manager is assisted by other Helena staff, as directed.  The Operation Manager is responsible for ensuring that Helena Staff are properly trained in the implementation of the Prevention Program which includes Safety Information, Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigations, and Emergency Contingency Plans.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHelena's Minooka, IL Facility is a non-responding facility. Helena has coordinated emergency response activities with its local emergency response agency and local fire department.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place, in the past five (5) years because of the ammonia operations at the Minooka, IL  Facility.\r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan implemented by Helena Chemical Company at the Minooka, IL Facility complies with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r). The RMP will be updated as the Minooka, IL Facility adds, deletes, or changes processes. The Emergency Response Program has been coordinated with the Kendall County LEPC and the Minooka Fire Protection District.  \r\n\r\nNOTE: Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the standard RMP produced by EPA's RMP Submit Program are not applicable to the Minooka, IL Facility."
