Arctic Glacier operates 39 production plants and 48 distribution facilities across Canada and the northeastern, central and western United States servicing more than 75,000 retail accounts. Arctic Glacier also licenses its trade names and proprietary technology to independently owned companies in Canada and the United States under franchise and license agreements.\n\n\n\nThe Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. management is not only committed to offering superior service, but also to maintaining a safety and environmental program to promote a safe environment for all its employees and the surrounding communities.  Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc.'s safety and environmental policies are administered by the Senior Plant Manager with the assistance of the Chief Engineer, who conducts periodic inspections of the facility to ensure compliance, and oversees the entire safety and environmental programs, including the PSM/RMP/CalARP Program. \n\n\n\nArctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. is a \"non-responding\" facility.  The facility's Emergency Coordinators (Chief Engineer, Regional Manager, and/or Senior Plant Manager) have discussed an emergency response plan with the City of Vernon Fire Department (Incident Commander).

The rest of the employees are to be evacuated from the facility to a designated area.  The contact information for the Emergency Coordinators and agencies are detailed in the Arctic Glacier Vernon Facility's Emergency Action Plan included in the PSM/MRP/CalARP Program. \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nThe Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. facility is located at 2970 East 50th Street in Vernon, California, which is located approximately 3.6 miles east of Interstate 110, 3.2 miles west of Interstate 710, and 2 miles south of Interstate 5. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban.  The facility was constructed and began operations in 2006.  \n\n\n\nThe primary business of Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. is to produce and distribute ice.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 30,850 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for the production and distribution of ice.  Typical operating conditions range from 10 psig on the low pressure side of the system to 180 psig on the high side.  Similar to a household refrigerator, there are no expected leaks or releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system at Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc., which is a closed-loop system.\n\n\n\nHigh pressure liquid from the High Pressure Receiver is supplied to the Flash Economizer.  From the Flash Economizer, the ammonia is fed to the -10?F and +10?F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Packages.  The -10?F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Package RRP-2 supplies sub-cooled liq"

The liquid settles to the bottom and the vapor rises to the top and is drawn off by Compressors C-3, C-4, and C-5. The +10?F Recirculated Liquid Recirculation Package RRP-1 supplies sub-cooled liquid ammonia to the Ice Machines and the Turbo Water Chiller and receives ammonia vapor/liquid mix from the Ice Machines and Turbo Water Chiller.  In the RRP-1, liquid settles to the bottom and vapor rises to the top and is drawn by Compressors C-1, C-2, C-3, and C-4.  From the compressors, the ammonia vapor is discharged to the Evaporative Condensers, Evaporators E-1 to E-16, and Ice Machines.  The Heat Exchanger receives high stage discharge from Compressors C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-5 and discharges high pressure liquid to the High Pressure Receiver.  The ammonia leaving the Evaporative Condensers is high pressure liquid which gravity flows into the High Pressure Receiver via the Thermosyphon Receiver in order to repeat the refrigeration cycle.\n\n\n\nAll process equipment and piping are designed according to ASME standards.   All ASME vessels and compressors are equipped with pressure relief valves which are set to actuate at 250 psig except for the pressure relief valves on the oil pots, oil separator on the compressors, and Evaporative Condensers which actuate at 300 psig.  All relief valves except for the relief valve on the evaporative condensers are tied to a common header that vent to the Ammonia Diffusion Tank.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nIn order to operate the ammonia refrigeration system, the facility complies with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Section 5189 of Title 8, CCR), the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP), and the California Emergency Management Agency (Cal "

Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the Arctic Glacier Vernon, Inc. operates in accordance with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, CalOSHA PSM Program, and EPA RMP Program.  It is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed designated safety limits.  Also, level indicators, alarms, and switches are installed in key points within the system to monitor the supply of liquid ammonia and to ensure that a vessel is not overfilled.  The facility also utilizes fixed ammonia leak detectors to alert personnel of a possible ammonia leak, to call the fire department when the concentration has reached 25 ppm, and to shut down the system at 10,000 ppm.  Pressure relief valves on all pressure vessels protect the equipment from overpressurization. \n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere have been no significant releases of anhydrous ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds or the state requirement manda"
