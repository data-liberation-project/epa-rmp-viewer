The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system as part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh. 40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs. The refrigeration system inventory exceeds the 10,000 lb. threshold.  Ammonia is recirculated in the system as a liquid and gas depending on system operating pressures and temperatures.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP was updated in June 2017 to reflect updates from a plant expansion project where the total onsite inventory was increased. \r\n\r\nFacility release modeling was performed using EPA's modeling program RMP*Comp. The worst-case scenario is based on the High Pressure Receiver as that vessel could potentially hold the largest quantity of ammonia. No passive or administrative controls were considered for the release scenario. \r\n\r\nThe alternate release scenario is based on an overpressure situation from a pressure relief valve. Other alternate cases were considered, including vessel overfilling, over pressurization scenarios, pipe ruptures and material handling and transfer hoses. \r\n\r\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.  The facility's PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, training, standard operating procedures, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications. All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/ RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plan. Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system. The facility has an eme"

In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.
