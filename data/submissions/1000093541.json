The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.  \r\n\r\nUniversal Prevention Activities\r\n\r\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Houston Gas Plant.  Collectively, these prevention program activities prevent or mitigate potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\r\n\r\nSpecialized Safety Features\r\n\r\nThe Houston Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered process:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n1.  Hand-held hydrocarbon detectors operated by facility personnel.  \r\n2.  Personnel are on site 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\r\n  \r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n1.  Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases.\r\n2.  Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual and automated).\r\n3.  Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high temperature)\r\n4.  Curbing or dyking to contain liquid releases.\r\n5.  Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system).\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n1.  Deluge system for specific equipment.\r\n2.  Trained emergency response personnel.\r\n3.  Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Houston Gas Plant experienced an accident in December 2018 while performing maintenance on the stabilizer.

The hot work permit documents the fire prevention and protection requirements prior to beginning hot work operations. The permit indicates the days on which hot work may be performed and the object upon which hot work is to be performed. Hot work permits are kept in a place that is easily accessible for the workers and on file at the office until the completion of hot work operations.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Houston Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Houston Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years.  Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety oblig"

Vapors for the hydrocarbons in the sludge were released from the open hatch on top of the holding tank. The vapor cloud was ignited and caused an explosion and fire. This explosion resulted in one death and injuries to three contractors. There was no property damage since the equipment involved was rented. The sample data collected following the accident is not definitive on whether the mixture in the holding tank had an NFPA 3 or 4 rating. It is also not possible to get a sample that would provide greater clarity.  Without definitively knowing this rating we cannot prove whether or not the mixture involved was an RMP regulated substance and should be included in the five-year accident history. Therefore, the accident has been included.\r\n\r\nAnother incident occurred on October 21, 2017 when a release from a pipeline was detected at an offsite receptor, there were no injuries or damage to equipment outside of the facility.  \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Houston Gas Plant is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b).  The facility maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in pace to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of company staff, local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the Houston Plant would rely on the local fire department to respond.\r\n\r\nEmployee receive training in the procedures to be followed when certain employees must remain to operate critical process operations before they evacuate.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. Other safety measures such as fire suppression, ambulatory, or evacuation of the community is coordinated and handled through local emergency response personnel in the community.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Houston Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant where it is first dehydrated to remove water.  The gas is then sent through refrigeration dew point control units where the condensable liquids will be extracted from the methane gas stream.  The gas is then sent through the turbo expander for additional pressure drop and liquids removal.  After passing through the turbo expander both the gas and liquids are sent to the deethanizer tower through different inlet trays.  The gas rises through the top and is ready to be sent into the sales pipeline.  The liquids are separated and sent through the bottom and to the surge tank and depropanzier.  A fractionator process then takes the B-G liquids and separates the iso- and normal- butane leaving natural gasoline.  A deethanizer removes ethane from the liquid stream and is sold via pipeline as a purity product.  \r\n\r\nLiquids are brought into the plant at the slug catchers and then are taken to the stabilizer where they are heated and separated, with the gas going back into the inlet process as described above.
