If an emergency were to occur at our Rodman location, signs are posted that refer to Jeff Bonnstetter who is employed by West Bend Elevator Co.  Signs also refer to Darrel Herscher who is employed part-time seasonally by West Bend Elevator Co. and is also a member of the Rodman Fire Dept.  Jeff and/or Darrell will decide what steps need to be taken in the event of an emergency.  This facility is a wholesale business providing products for the production of grain and livestock enterprises.  Our worst case scenario is failure of one of our anhydrous ammonia storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed which is 50,490 pounds.  This would cause the anhydrous to become liquefied under pressure.  If this were to occur the release rate would be 5,050 pounds per minute and the duration of the release would be 10 minutes.    According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 2.6 miles.  Rodman has 2 bullet tanks containing anhydrous ammonia at their location.  There are an estimated 150 people within this radius.  Residences and recreation areas are within this radius.  It is this facility's intention to comply with EPA'S accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  West Bend Elevator Company holds training sessions regularly to train new employees and review procedures with other employees.  Hoses, valves, and vents are inspected on a regular basis for any problems.  The anhydrous ammonia plant was designed, installed, and is maintained with state laws and regulations in mind.   We have never had an accident involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in the past 5 years.  In the event of an emergency i"
