The company has developed patented devices to aid in the protection of releases of the type the site is subject to.  All employees are trained to high levels of preparedness to cope with such incidents.  A policy of providing emergency response information is and has been a central part of Dumont's policies.  In advance of this program, Dumont has provided local responders, such as fire departments, with complete facility layouts, etc.  The company has also extended the offer of training at no charge to some county governmental agencies. \n\nThe Dumont Company is a distributor of industrial chemicals primarily serving water and waste water treatment.  The business has a total of four on-site employes and would be considered small in comparison to other similarly titled businesses.  The only material stored in sufficient quantities at the Labelle site is Chlorine, CAS# 7782-50-5. \n\nDumont performs the following functions at its Labelle facility pertaining to Federal Regulations contained in 40 CFR 68. \n\n1.  Receives, unloads and stores vessels containing a material covered under 40 CFR 68 (specifically-         chlorine) from vendors. \n2.  Reloads and transports subject transport vessels to customers premises. \n3.  Transports, unloads, and stores empty subject vessels. \n4.  Reloads empty subject vessels on vendor transportation. \n5.  Normal storage quantities are four ton containers and seventy-five one hundred fifty pound containers.\n\nDumont does not in its normal course of business perform any of the following functions with the material subject to the regulation sited.\n\n1.  Dumont does not consume subject material. \n2."

Dumont does not open subject vessels for imspection or other purposes.\n\nBecause of the nature of the operation defined, the safety history of the Dumont organization, the attention fo the safety proram documented within this proram, and its position related to public receptors, environmental receptors and emergency responders, the risk of potenital releases and related dangers are assessed as minimal to minimal-moderate.  The worst case scenario would be a rupture of a ton cylinder of Chlorine gas, if unmitigated would have an end point of slightly over six miles.  Mitigation factors include a fully enclosed building and on-site vault for use in case of leak. \n\nAs latter defined in addition Risk Management Plan (RMP) documentation, the following factors are stated for summary. \n\nA.  Dumont's record pertaining to releases of said material is outstanding-(No reportable releases).\nB.  Dumont has instituted safety measures and procedures to minimize release impact. \nC.  Dumont's facility is located in an industrial area that is a low density small urban/rural environment.\nD.  No major public receptors are located in a quarter mile radius. \nE.  No major environmental areas of concern are located in a quarter mile radius.\nF.  At the expected release rate of thirty-five pounds per hour or less, the impact area of concern is approximately 1,500 feet for a 10 PPM effect.  (60 minute release-Rural Conditions Table 15). \nG.  Potential for catastrophic release of one or more of the subject vessels is statistically minute. \nH.  Risk analysis of all potential practical risks confirm findings.  A worst case scenario of a ruptured ton container is envisioned is 6.075 miles. \nI.  Local responders have copies of our response procedures and plant layout, etc. \n\nIn general, the accident release program consists of close inspection of received"
