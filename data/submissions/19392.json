From here it is transferred by gravity to fill totes and drums. The drums and totes are stored and supplied to customers. The worstcase release scenario which was modeled was the release of the entire contents of the storage vessel into its containment area. The alternate release scenario modeled was the unconfined release of the contents of a 55 gallon drum. This event was selected based on the findings of the Process Hazard Analysis. No credit was taken for any secondary containment or other measures to prevent and/or mitigate such an incident. There are offsite consequences associated with both release scenarios.\n\nd.\tAmmonia solution is received by tank truck and transferred to an atmospheric storage tank.

Physical safeguards to prevent a release include the installation of remotely actuated valves. Storage tanks and drum fillers are located within containment dikes designed to hold the entire contents of the largest tank. All transfer and filling operations follow strict and comprehensive written procedures. Operations are constantly attended. Equipment, instrumentation and piping (including transfer hoses) are subject to rigorous inspection and preventative maintenance policies and procedures.\n\ng.\tThere have been no accidents to report under the 5-year Accident History Component of the RMP.\n\nh.\tSOCO-Lynch has a well-manned and well-equipped Hazmat Emergency Response Team which can respond quickly yet safely to spills and other incidents. All team members are trained and certified in accordance with federal/Cal-OSHA Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response requirements by the California Specialized Training Institute (CSTI).
