Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Lobeco Products, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the Sheldon Township Fire District  which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass High Technology Chemical Manufacturing.  We have nine (9) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Oleum (Fuming Sulfuric acid), Methyl chloroformate, Formaldehyde, Muriatic acid (Hydrochloric acid),  Monoisopropylamine (Isopropylamine), Dimethylamine, Ethylenediamine, Ammonia and Ethyl Chloride.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Oleum (24% solution) and Formaldehyde (30% Solution) are used to manufacture a water based additive.

The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  For alternative release scenario analyses, we have employed the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Oleum Storage Tank T-8404.  The scenario involves the release of 38,400 lb. of Oleum (24% solution).  Toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released from which evaporation takes place, with a temperature of 102 degrees F and average ambient relative humidity of 72%.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 2379.14 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as a dike are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s wind speed, the maximum distance of 0.55 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.01000 mg/L.\n\nOne alternative release scenario has been submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 2 and Program 3 processes cumulatively.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Oleum (24%) involves a releas"

Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release  during this period.\n\n6.    Emergency Response Plan\nLobeco Products, Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  As part of the Beaufort County Local Emergency Response Committee (LEPC) actions, the plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modification to our emergency response.\n\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.  Existing dike systems have been modified and some new dikes constructed around those chemicals that are affected by the RMP Program.        We have also constructed an enclosure around our Methyl chloroformate Storage Tank T-#22 as an added passive mitigation system.  Also as part of our Methyl chloroformate modifications, we have initiated a semi-annual preventive maintenance program that verifies the integrity of the associated pump for off-loading the chemical from the tank truck.  These changes have already taken place, but Lobeco Products, Inc. is committed to continuously striving to provide safety features to prevent any accidental release of a hazardous chemical substance.\n\n8.
