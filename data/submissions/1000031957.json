Management systems are in place to assure all facilities are complying with these principles.  There are Corporate Engineering Standards and Health, Environment, and Safety Guidelines which address every aspect of Risk Management from the design of intrinsically safe processes, to the use of risk assessment, to incident tracking and program audits. Bayer MaterialScience LLC is headquartered in Pittsburgh PA and is a subsidiary of Bayer AG, which is headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany.  Bayer MaterialScience LLC has its own company structure, policies and procedures which are consistent with those of the holding company, but are customized to meet local regulations and standards.  Bayer AG has established guidelines for Responsible Care in Environmental Protection and Safety, which include a Directive for Process and Plant Safety that all Bayer facilities world-wide are expected to follow.  It provides guidance for safe process design and operation.\n\n\n\nIn the US, Bayer MaterialScience LLC is an active member of the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Initiative.  Bayer has implemented all seven codes of management practice.  Bayer MaterialScience LLC has a Health, Safety, Environment, and Quality Policy which states that it is the company's responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers and communities.

Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe primary activities at the New Martinsville facility are towards the manufacture of polyurethane intermediates, coatings intermediates and thermoplastics.  Products include polyethers, prepolymers, polyesters and thermoplastic urethanes.  In addition, aromatic isocyanides, and hydrochloric acid are received for reprocessing and repackaging.  The New Martinsville facility uses or stores four of the RMP listed chemicals on the site as of December 1, 2012.  Of the four chemicals covered, three are raw materials and one is a finished product.  All four chemicals were modeled using worst case release parameters as a screening exercise to determine the worst case scenario for the facility.    The worst case scenario chemical for the New Martinsville site is ethylene oxide.  The alternative scenarios in order of potential off-site impact are ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and ethylene diamine and toluene diisocyanate.\n\n\n\n3.  Worst C"

      "SummaryText": "ase Scenario for the Facility\n\nThe worst case release scenario for the New Martinsville facility is the rupture of the ethylene oxide storage tank into a dike that is 1100 square feet and 12 feet deep.  Because of the low storage temperature, the release to the atmosphere occurs through evaporation from a pool.   Through use of dispersion modeling (RMP*Comp), the endpoint distance is 1.8 miles and reaches offsite receptors.  This release assumes no mitigation other than containment in a dike.\n\n\n\n4.  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nAlternative scenarios were developed for all of the RMP chemicals. The alternative scenario for ethylene oxide has the largest potential impact distance of the group. In this scenario it is assumed that a leak develops during the unloading of a rail car.  Under typical weather conditions the distance to the endpoint is 1.0 miles and reaches offsite receptors.\n\n\n\n5.  Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe New Martinsville Plant complies with all elements of the OSHA PSM Rule and the EPA RMP Rule.  There are safety procedures, standard operation emergency procedures, accident investigations, hot work and line opening permits, extensive training programs, on-site emergency response teams, vessel inspection programs, and experienced personnel both in the salaried and hourly workforce.  Bayer MaterialScience LLC is an active member of the ACC Ethylene Oxide Safety Panel that deals with ethylene oxide safety issues on an industry-wide basis.\n\n\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no releases in the past five years that had off-site consequences.  A liquid TDI release within the plant resulted in an OSHA Recordable Accident in 2008.  The release totaled 10 pounds.  At the New Martinsville facility, there has never been any offsite impact resulting from the release of chemicals listed in the rule. \n\n\n\n7.
