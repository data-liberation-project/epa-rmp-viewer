We will maintain a safety and health program that conforms to the best practices of organizations similar to ours.  The objective of our safety and health program is to surpass the best experience of operations similar to ours.  Our goal is for every employee to embrace the \"zero-injury\" philosophy; that is, every accident that causes an injury or illness is preventable, and no accidents are acceptable to us.  \nOur preventative measures start prior to the introduction of any new chemical entering the facility.  Changes are reviewed at several levels including safety and environmental impacts.  Emphasis is placed on characterizing all incoming materials to determine the protective measures necessary to safely store and handle the material. No chemical substance enters or leaves our facility without written information that provides the hazardous properties and safe handling precautions for the substance.  Our storage and processing equipment is designed to safely contain and handle the materials used.  Design data and process evaluations are reviewed at multiple levels to ensure their completeness.  Our ongoing programs to inspect, maintain, and improve our processes are a testament to 3V's commitment to keep our employees, the surrounding community, and the environment safe.\n\nFacility and Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe 3V, Inc. facility is located adjacent to the Sampit River, approximately 4.0 miles west of Highway 17 South on Woodstock Road in Georgetown County, South Carolina. The core business is dedicated to the batch production of organic specialty chemicals.  Customers range from the cosmetics industry to paper and pulp manufacturers. \n\nOur manufacturing scheme is relatively similar for all "

      "SummaryText": "products.  Measured quantities of raw materials are pumped from storage tanks to a reaction vessel via a closed piping system.  Various additives and solid materials are sometimes loaded into the reactors via portals or dump chutes.  The mixture is then reacted by manipulation of temperatures and pressures in the reaction vessel.  The resulting mixture is then transferred to downstream equipment where mechanical operations such as filtering, drying, and packaging are performed.  Any unreacted material is then recovered for reuse or treated and removed.  In general, the storage, transfer, and reaction steps are the most critical in terms of safety.  The majority of our final products are non-hazardous.\n\nThree of 3V's stored raw materials that receive particular emphasis on safe handling are acetaldehyde, vinyl acetate and hydrazine. All materials are stored and processed in closed systems with protective alarms and features.  Through careful planning and controls, acetaldehyde has been handled safely for over 3 years.  The vinyl acetate system has been safely handled for over 19 years. Hydrazine will be stored and processed in the same manner to ensure safe handling.\n\nWorst Case Toxic Release Scenario:\nTo determine the worst case toxic release scenario for hydrazine and vinyl acetate were evaluated.  The hydrazine release scenario resulted in the greater distance to the endpoint of the two scenarios evaluated, and therefore, was selected as the worst case scenario for the site.  This scenario involved the failure of the storage tank, which contains the total inventory of hydrazine for the site.  The storage tank for hydrazine is located outside in a concrete containment structure.  EPA's model, RMPComp, was used to evaluate the distances to the toxic end points.  Even though the endpoint is located beyond the facility boundary, there are no offsite receptors (houses, churches, schools, etc.) located within that distance.   \n\nAlternate Toxic Release Scenario:\nThe alte"

Hydrazine again resulted in the greater distance.  As with the worst case scenario, the failure of the storage tank was considered. EPA's model, RMPComp, was used to evaluate the distances to the toxic end points.  Even though the endpoint is located beyond the facility boundary, there are no offsite receptors (houses, churches, schools, etc.) located within that distance.\n\n\nWorst Case Flammable Release Scenario:\nThe worst case release scenario for acetaldehyde was the loss of the maximum inventory in an external storage tank accompanied by a vapor cloud explosion.  Again, the end points of such an event extend beyond the facility boundary but do not reach any receptors. The closest house is more than five times the distance from the facility as the worst case end point.  The alternate release scenario for this material is a release from the same vessel, but assumes that the tank is half full and the failure of the tank is through a 3-inch opening.  In this case the distance to an end point is within the facility boundary. \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention Steps:\nAll waste management, raw materials and finished products operations are performed with the necessary precautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of flammable or reactive materials.  Smoking is prohibited throughout the facility except in limited designated areas.  Hot work must be conducted by permit only and not in the presence of combustible materials.  Process equipment and storage tanks containing flammable liquids are grounded and inerted with nitrogen and equipped with flame arrestors.  Oxidizers and organic peroxides are segregated from combustible and flammable liquids.  Signs are posted at the entrance to the facility prohibiting smoking, matches or open flames.

Containment structures exist around tanks and process units containing hazardous materials to contain spills should they occur.  These structures are inspected routinely and deficiencies are addressed as they are discovered.  Storage tanks containing flammable or toxic liquids are provided with nitrogen blankets to remove oxygen, vent controls to avoid over or under pressurization, and safety devices to protect the tank from failure.  Structural integrity of vessels, piping systems and tanks is determined by the presence or absence of visible leaks during visual inspections each shift as well as from scheduled non destructive thickness testing at recommended intervals.\nThe acetaldehyde, vinyl acetate and hydrazine systems and all associated manufacturing processes are covered under the OSHA Process Safety Management rule.  As 'covered' chemicals, their use is evaluated for safety from loading and storage to final processing.  Hazard studies have been performed for all equipment, procedures, and monitoring systems related to the handling of these chemicals.  3V's Process Safety Management program is fully implemented to prevent releases of these substances by incorporating the following features: 1) hazard identification,  2) protective measures, 3) procedures written to emphasize correct handling and operation, 4) control systems, 5) periodic equipment inspection and maintenance, and 6) training of all personnel associated with hazardous processes.  \n\nThe storage systems for acetaldehyde and vinyl acetate are designed to meet NFPA requirements for flammable liquids.

This is a testament to our ability to safely handle these materials without risk to off site populations.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n3V Inc. (3V) has a complete Emergency Response Plan (Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned release of hazardous materials to the air, soil, or surface water.  The plan is organized into two sections. The first section consists of general information about the 3V facility, preparedness and prevention, training requirements, how the emergency organization is established, coordinating with outside agencies and implementation of the plan in an emergency situation.

In addition, employees who may become involved with a hazardous material release are trained on how to recognize hazardous materials and/or hazardous situations for purposes of taking defensive measures (alarm, containment, control, and evacuation).  \n\nDrill exercises are planned and scheduled for training of emergency response personnel as necessary to keep these personnel current in their training and proficient in procedures and equipment use.  \nGeorgetown County is a member of an independent, local, community alert network and 3V Inc. is a participant in that effort.
