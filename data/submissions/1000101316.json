NEO maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, including operational and mechanical integrity programs as well as employee and contractor training elements, to prevent or minimize consequences of potential releases of biogas or RNG.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\nWithin the past five years from the date of this report, this facility has had zero accidents that have either (i) resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site, or (ii) resulted in known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nEmergency Response Coordination\nNEO coordinates with Twin Falls County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that local emergency response is aware of the quantity of methane on-site, the risks associated with the process, and the resources and capabilities at the facility to respond to an accidental release. To address changes at the facility or with the emergency response organization, coordination activities are planned annually and updated more frequently as necessary.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nNEO recognizes that the implementation of this program is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving methane handling operations at the facility. As such, NEO will update the RMP as necessary to prevent and mitigate the risk of an accidental release that could impact the public and/or environment, and to maintain compliance with the RMP rule."

      "SummaryText": "New Energy One LLC (\u201cNEO\u201d) has developed this program for its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility in the county of Twin Fall, near the city of Filer, Idaho in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (USEPA\u2019s) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (CAPP) of the Clean Air Act, as amended (CAAA), a.k.a., the Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule, which is codified at 40 CFR 68. The facility consists of several systems including six anaerobic digesters and RNG upgrading and conditioning equipment. An 8.5-mile pipeline with a compression system injects the RNG produced into a high-pressure pipeline owned by Northwest Pipeline. The pipeline and compression system are under the jurisdiction of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). At the facility, biogas generated in the anaerobic digesters is upgraded to RNG by removing unwanted constituents to produce a final pipeline quality product that is at least 98% methane. The total quantity of methane within the facility\u2019s process exceeds the threshold quantity for a regulated substance as defined by the USEPA and is therefore subject to RMP regulations.\n\nThe facility's methane process meets the eligibility requirements for a Program 1 RMP. This program includes a:\n- Hazard assessment that details the potential effects of an accidental release, an evaluation of worst-case release scenario, and an accident history of the last 5 years; and\n- Documented history of emergency response coordination efforts with local emergency planning and response organizations that details the emergency action plan, emergency contact information, and nature of coordination activities between NEO and local emergency response officials (e.g., the fire department).\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\nThis RMP program has been designed to prevent the accidental release of methane onto offsite locations that could expose the public and/or environment to serious hazards, and to mitigate the severity of rele"
