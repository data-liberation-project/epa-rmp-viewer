Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe MarkWest (MarkWest) - Cobb facility located in Clendenin, West Virginia is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is the policy of MarkWest to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible release of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, MarkWest is completely coordinated with the Kanawha County, West Virginia Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) which provides emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe primary function of the MarkWest facility encompasses natural gas liquid (NGL) extraction.  NGL's, propane, and lean oil are the three substances present at the facility regulated by Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations.  NGL's, a flammable substance, are a mixture comprised of propane, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline (pentanes and hexanes).  \n\n\n\nThe NGL's are extracted from a natural gas transmission pipeline.  Once extracted, the NGL is stored in  five 30,000-gallon capacity pressure vessels (A07-A11), and in three smaller pressure vessels (A02, A03, and A017) ranging in size from 4,200, 10,000, and 12,000-gallon capacities, respectively.   The NGL is then transferred via tank truck to a fractionation facility.\n\n\n\nPropane, used as a refrigerant in the process, is stored at the facility in one 10,000-gallon capacity above ground pressure vessel.\n\n\n\nLean oil is a product comprised primarily of pentanes and hexanes, is both extracted from the natural gas transmission stream and is used to extract"

      "SummaryText": " NGL's from the natural gas stream.  Lean oil is stored at the facility in two 20,000-gallon capacity above ground pressure vessels.\n\n\n\nThe total quantity of product stored in the vessels is administratively controlled to ensure that the vessels are not filled above 80% of full capacity.  Additionally, pressure relief devices provide added assurance that the vessels are not over-filled to pressures above 250 pounds per square inch (psi).  These controls are in place to prevent the potential for over-pressurization which could cause structural damage to the vessels and lead to a release.\n\n\n\nBased on the administrative controls described above, the maximum inventory of NGL's present at the facility would be equal to 85% of the total 176,200-gallon capacity: 149,770 gallons (the equivalent of 868,666 pounds) of NGL.  The maximum quantity of propane would be 35,943 lbs.\n\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario,\n\nincluding administrative controls and mitigation measures in place to limit the distance for each reported scenario\n\n\n\nThe parameters of the offsite consequence analyses for this MarkWest facility were based on the requirements set forth in the RMP rules outlined in 40 CFR 68.25 (e), Worst-case release scenario-flammables  and 40 CFR 68.28, Alternative release scenario analysis.  The worst case and alternative case radii of effect were determined utilizing RMP*Comp software provided by the EPA.  The following describes brief summaries of the chosen scenarios.\n\n \n\nThe MarkWest facility's worst case release scenario is the catastrophic release of the entire contents of  one of the five 30,000-gallon pressure vessels (A07-A011) containing NGLs.   Administrative procedures limit the inventory of each of these tanks to 147,900 pounds. A release of this nature would reach offsite public receptors. The facility has many physical controls in place to prevent such a release from occurring. However, the regulations stipulate that these measur"

Approximately 14,790 lbs of NGL are released with this scenario.  Offsite public receptors would be affected.  In addition to administrative controls, active mitigation includes pressure relief valves on the vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accident Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention \n\n    Steps\n\n\n\nMarkWest has taken all the necessary steps to comply with accidental release prevention requirements sets out under 40 CFR Part 68 of the EPA regulations. The facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe following briefly describes the elements of the release prevention program in place at the MarkWest stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nMarkWest maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nMarkWest conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with the processes at the facility are identified and controlled efficiently.  The HAZOP methodology is used to carry out these analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazard analyses are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, MarkWest maintains written operating procedures.

New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe integrity of mechanical operations at MarkWest is ensured through documented maintenance checks on process equipment.  Process equipment examined by these checks include among others: pressurized storage vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nWritten procedures are in place at MarkWest to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.
