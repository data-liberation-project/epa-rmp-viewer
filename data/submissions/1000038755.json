      "SummaryText": "Located at 2710 Regency Drive in Grand Prairie Texas, the stationary source is a third party warehouse that receives, stores and ships products owned by its customers. \r\nThe warehouse stores a variety of commodities including Lupranate T80 Type 1 Isocyanate which contains a mixture of 80% Toluene 2,4-diisocyanate and 20% Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate. Both of these substances are included on the EPA's list of regulated substances requiring a Risk Management Plan when stored over the threshold quantity amount. \r\nThe substance is delivered via truck or container in 55 gallon drums that are segregated to a designated storage room in the rear of the facility. The storage room is designed to maintain a controlled temperature for the product and has a fully functioning ESFR Sprinkler system as does the rest of the warehouse. \r\nThis product is new to this warehouse and there is no accident history to report. Worst case and alternative release scenarios are outlined in this plan. A worst case release scenario of 20% Toluene 2,6-diisocyanate would yield a toxic endpoint radius of 1.8 miles. This includes some environmental and public receptors although the warehouse is located in an industrial section of the city. Further details on the release scenarios and how the calculations where determined are included in the Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios sections of this report. \r\nAccidental release prevention starts with all employees being certified to OSHA forklift operating standards, Hazardous Material Handling and GHS (Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling Chemicals). Employees are also trained on the company's procedures, safety and emergency response plan. A designated room was built to store the regulated product and maintain a desired temperature. Additional site training will be held before receiving the product and to implement the Risk Management Plan. Additional changes to improve safety will be implemented after the product is received and"

      "SummaryText": "operations are evaluated.  \r\nIn the case of an accidental release of the regulated substance, the warehouse employees would not respond with cleanup efforts, but rather a third-party contracted cleanup team would be called in to respond to the release. The warehouse does have an emergency response plan, but since it does not cover employee response to the regulated substances, that section has been omitted from this plan. \r\nForklifts are used to receive, store and ship the product. SDSs are kept on site, and no hazardous products are allowed into the warehouse without the proper SDS. Maximum inventory is anticipated not to exceed 150 drums. Routine cleaning, sanitization and minor maintenance is done by warehouse employees. Most maintenance is contracted to third parties. Hazard reviews are conducted weekly with more in-depth reviews done monthly. Under the guidance of this RMP plan, compliance audits will be carried out at least every three years to ensure compliance with the elements in this plan. The site operates by the 24 standard operating procedures established by the operating company. Further information regarding items mentioned in this paragraph along with information on safety and incident investigation can be found in the Prevention Program section of this plan."
