UTi's facility, located at 901 Renaissance Boulevard in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, is used to store packaged finished goods for Diversey (a division of Sealed Air) prior to their distribution.  \n\n\n\nBecause UTi stores aerosol products at the distribution center, the site has the potential to exceed the threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds for flammable substances that are used as propellants in aerosol cans.  Therefore, UTi is submitted a predictive filing for flammable substances.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario performed, based on the TNT-Equivalency Method presented in EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, indicates that the distance to the 1 psi overpressure will not extend beyond the DC property line.  Therefore, no public or environmental receptors are impacted.\n\n\n\nAn emergency response plan is maintained at the facility and reviewed annually to identify potential plan updates recommended to improve site safety.  No accidental releases of regulated flammable substances have occurred at the facility in the last 5 years.  Coordination of emergency response activities is facilitated by the site's inclusion in the Racine County's Office of Emergency Management offsite response plan and by compliance with the annual chemical inventory filing requirements of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act program.\n\n\n\nUTi is filing the resubmit of the RMP in 2014 to include peracetic acid (CAS 79-21-0) since the facility has the potential to exceed the 10,000 lb. limit for storage.  Storage of this material is in special designed segregated three level racking system with sprinkler lines built in at each level of storage with a secondary containment structure for any potential spill.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario (WCRS) used the ALOHA 5.4.4 model, the toxic endpoint for peracetic acid of 0.0045 mg/l, the immediate rele"

The WRCS for this release from the storage location within the facility was within a 0.031 mile radius, and within the facility boundary; therefore, no offsite facilities, populations or public receptors would be potentially impacted.  The engineering report and calculations was conducted by Conestoga-Rovers & Associates, Inc., 8615 W. Bryn Mawr Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60631.\n\n\n\nThe WCRS has been included with the 2014 filing for Racine County Emergency Management Off Site Facility Plan.\n\n\n\nUTi has not had any accidents that would result in a release event in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nUTi has coordinated emergency response procedures between the stationary source and local emergency planning and response organizations.
