If a release does occur, however, our trained personnel, in conjunction with trained personnel from the community, will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of Processes and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery operates a variety of petroleum refining process to produce propane, propylene, butanes, butylene, gasolines, kerosene, diesel fuels and asphalt.  These processes include: atmospheric and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, reforming, fluidized catalytic cracking, alkylation, and associated supporting operations such as crude unloading, sulfur recovery, product blending, storage and product loading.  The NAICS code for the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery is 32411 and must meet the requirements of Risk Management Plan (RMP) Program Level 3.\n\n\n\nThe RMP rule defines a process as \"Any activity involving a regulated substance, including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process\" (re: 40 CFR 68.3).\n\n\n\nPer the RMP definition, the Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has the following RMP regulated flammables in its processes:\n\n\n\n                      ?  Pentane\n\n                      ?  Butane/Isobutane\n\n                      ?  Butene\n\n                      ?  Propane\n\n                      ?  Propene\n\n                      ?  Ethane\n\n                      ?  Methane\n\n\n\nOf the above substances, only Butane, Isobutane, Propane and Propene meet the RMP threshold quantity level for flammables.\n\n\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery also has the following regulated toxics in its proce"

Sulfur Dioxide\n\n\n\nThe maximum on site quantities of Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfur Dioxide do not exceed 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds, respectively.  Therefore, these compounds do not meet RMP threshold levels.  However, we do have prevention and safety programs in place for all Hydrogen Sulfide handling units as part of our Process Safety Management Program. \n\n\n\nBased upon threshold quantities and process definition, Sinclair Tulsa Refinery is reporting the following two processes in its RMP:\n\n\n\n?   C4 Mixture:    This represents a butane/isobutane/butylene mixture.  The maximum quantity of C4 Mixture onsite at any time is estimated to be 20,400,000 pounds.  This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of C4 Mixture with an allowance for process piping volume and material in process.\n\n\n\n?   C3 Mixture:    The maximum quantity of propane onsite at any time is 1,940,000 pounds. This estimate is based upon the total storage capacity of C3 Mixture with an allowance for process piping volume and material in process.\n\n\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Results\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has no toxic substances onsite that meet the threshold requirements for coverage.  However, we are tracking both hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide internally to ensure that our prevention and safety programs adequately cover potential releases. \n\n\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has not had any RMP-defined accidents. While releases have been documented, none have been of threshold substances, nor have these releases had offsite consequences. After each release, we investigated what happened, recorded the recommendations, and made changes to our processes, procedures, or safety systems to mitigate and eliminate future problems. \n\n\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has instituted and maintains a process safety management (PSM"

While the following sections are required and practiced for process safety management, Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has other programs and practices (i.e. lock out/tag out, etc.) which add to the operational safety of the refinery.\n\n\n\nEmployees participate in all aspects of process safety management by being members of the process hazard analysis team for new installations or procedures, members of the prestartup safety review team and being a member of incident investigations.  Employees participate in development and review of operating procedures and by suggesting and becoming knowledgeable of changes in their respective areas of responsibilities (management of change).  Process safety information, Material Safety Data Sheets and mechanical equipment data is available to all employees.  Employees are trained and refreshed on the use of hot work permits (as well as lockout/tagout, confined space entry, opening process equipment, line opening and blinding, control of entrance/exit of units, Hazmat and emergency response, etc.).\n\n\n\nProcess safety information is provided in many forms.  A hazards communication program and laboratory chemical hygiene plan informs employees and contractors of the chemical hazards to which they may be exposed and the measures that need to be taken to protect them.  The engineering records and operating manuals provide maximum intended inventories, safe upper and lower operating limits, evaluation of consequences of deviation, materials of construction, piping and instrumentation diagrams, electrical area classifications, relief systems design and design basis, ventilation systems, design codes and standards, energy and material balances, and safety systems.\n\n\n\nProcess hazards analysis has been performed on all applicable processes by the hazard and operability study method.  This structured approach uses pro"

New facilities are subjected to this analysis before operation.\n\n\n\nWritten operating procedures are in place to provide clear instruction for all aspects of operations of the refinery.  These procedures cover any type of operation on each unit, including anything from normal operation to startup procedures to emergency shutdown to partial operation of a unit.\n\n\n\nTraining is provided to all operations employees covering their job functions working on the process units.  Initial training requires a program of classroom and on-the-job training which takes a four-step progression of levels of certification.  A written and/or performance test is given at completion of the four levels and progression to the next level cannot take place without the approval of the supervisor.  Beyond the initial training, refresher training is continually provided which allows recertification of all operators every three years.\n\n\n\nContractor's safety is monitored and when performing maintenance and repair, turnaround, major renovation or specialty work on or adjacent to a process unit they are required to have a safety workplan.  Sinclair Tulsa Refinery evaluates each contractor's safety performance.  Each contractor must provide safety policies and programs, injury and illness performance reports and training records before performing work.  Safety orientation is provided before starting work to inform contractor's employees of all the safety programs practices which must be followed inside the refinery.\n\n\n\nBefore starting up any new unit or significantly modified unit, a pre-startup safety review is held.  This constitutes a final checklist for the process prior to startup.  In some instances designed safety elements have been eliminated, not constructed properly or just missed because of economic considerations.  The review ensu"

The refinery has its own Emergency Response Team that can respond to any Fire, Rescue, Spill or Vapor Release.  The Emergency Response Team receives specialized training enabling them to handle industrial type emergencies.  Each Emergency Response Team member can be reached 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency by electronic pager.  If an emergency should occur the Refinery operates under the Incident Command type system along with having its own 800 MHZ two-way radio that is programmed to the LEPC (Fire Department) radio frequency.  With these two items in place the refinery can establish quick communication with the Fire Department for aid and public notification if the emergency warrants.  In addition the Fire Department is given periodic walk through tours of the refinery to familiarize themselves with the specific areas of the plant along with reviewing the different types of emergency equipment the refinery has and its location.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has instituted the following items to improve safety for its employees and community:\n\n* Removed chlorine from its water treating system and replaced it with a much safer substitute.\n\n* Installed excessive vibration monitors and emergency shutdowns on critical process unit pumps.\n\n* Took arrival of an Emergency-ONE Freightliner Foam Pumper Industrial Fire Truck that contains 2000 gallons of fire fighting foam concentrate.  \n\n* Purchased four (4) 2-wheeled portable fire monitors rated at 500 gpm water discharge.\n\n\n\n\n\nSinclair Oil Corporation\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma Refinery\n\n"
