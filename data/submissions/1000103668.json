Facility Policy.\r\n\r\nIf an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Fillmore County Emergency Management, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information.\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the production of anhydrous ammonia as an agricultural product. The ammonia production process uses natural gas and ambient air as production inputs. The natural gas and ambient air react to produce anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. Five-Year Accident History.\r\n\r\nThe facility had four accidental releases of ammonia.  The releases took place on March 14, 2018, August 30, 2018, December 1, 2018, and February 9, 2020.  With all of the releases the proper agencies were notified as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n4. Emergency Response.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program established by NE Nitro Geneva does allow for personnel to respond to accidental releases of regulated substance, unless the release is too large and beyond the site's response team's capability.  If NE Nitro Geneva is unable to respond to an emergency, they have identified resources to mitigate, control, and dispose of a release.  The local emergency response agency (Fillmore County Emergency Management) will be relied upon to inform the public about the release. NE Nitro Geneva has developed an Emergency Action Plan outlining actions taken in the event of an accidental release of regulated substances as well as in the event of natural disasters. The Emergency Action Plan is provided below for reference.\r\n\r\n5. Accidental Release Prevention Program.\r\n\r\nNE Nitro Geneva has implemented environmental, emergency, and safety programs. Equipment maintenance checks are completed that assist in the ability for NE Nitro Geneva staff to respond to emergencies. Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention (SWPPP) plans have been"

NE Nitro Geneva has developed a Prevention Program in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 for a Program Level 3 facility. \r\n\r\nThe facility conducts monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual training as part of normal activities. Training consists of regulated safety requirements. A Process Safety Management (PSM) program has been implemented. Anhydrous ammonia is a PSD-applicable chemical on site. Safety inspections are completed regularly with in-house and outside expertise as necessary. Periodic reviews are completed on plans and procedures, with scheduling for additional training as part of the review process. \r\n\r\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\r\n\r\nRoutine evaluations are completed to assess equipment conditions at the facility. NE Nitro Geneva has a Mechanical integrity written plan to confirm chemical storage tanks are in proper working condition. \r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLAN\r\n\r\n1.
