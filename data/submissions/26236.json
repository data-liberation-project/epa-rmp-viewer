THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF THE STORAGE TANK OVER A 10 MINUTE TIME SPAN. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE 53,040 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS. THE DISTANCE TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT (POINT OF DISPERSION TO 200 PPM) IS 0.67 MILES. \n\n   B. THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE. THE DISTANCE TO THE TOXIC ENDPOINT IS 0.41 MILES.\n\nIV. THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE, PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n   A. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1, PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE INC.\n\n   B. THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTEDTHE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111, STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\nV.
