Ag Wise, Inc. has composed the following summary for the public.\n\nThe Facility Policy-The employees of Ag Wise, Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our local fire department and others involved to insure proper steps are taken to get the problem solved.\n\nFacility Information-The primary activity at our facility is the storage and blending of both dry and liquid fertilizers for sale to area farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.   The maximum quantity stored would be 140,000 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity.  The distance to the endpoint is 5 miles.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in the transfer hose.\n\nThe Five Year Accident History-There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program-The facility has a written emergency action.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations and training programs are performed to insure safe conditions."
