The MIPA system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-30 and state law.\r\n\r\nFive-year accident history:  \r\nOn June 22, 2012 there was a spill of approximately 200 gallons of MIPA during the unloading of a tanker truck into one of the MIPA storage tanks.  The incident report indicated that near the end of the unloading the transfer hose became shaking due to the slugs of nitrogen gas flowing through with remaining liquid and the hose broke where it enters the camlock fitting.  At the time of the incident the Odom worker was wearing the proper PPE and was able to make his way around the truck to the other side where the shut-off valve was located to stop the flow.  During the time of the uncontrolled release of MIPA a large vapor cloud immediately formed in the area and began moving out into an adjacent field. The driver of the truck was not wearing PPE and immediately ran from the area through the same adjacent field and into the forming vapor cloud where he was immediately placed into high exposure with the substance.  A combination of human factors and mechanical failure of the hose were attributed to the spill.  Had the driver been wearing the designated PPE and stayed at his station the truck valve could have been closed sooner and a lower amount of MIPA released. The transfer hose has subsequently been switched over to a stainless steel braided hose offering more strength and chemical resistance \r\n\r\nThe emergency response program: \r\n\r\nIn the event of an emergency involving our MIPA system, it is our policy to notify t"

If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the local Fire Department and LEPC requesting that they respond to the emergency.  We do not maintain a fire brigade, but do maintain fire response equipment such as hand held fire extinguishers for small fires.\r\n\r\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \r\n\r\nThe facility operates two (2) monoisopropylamine (MIPA) storage tanks, two batch reaction tanks (4,125 gal and 2,500 gal), and two scrubbers for control of MIPA vapors (one for the storage tanks and one for reactor batch tanks).  The MIPA Tank 1 has a storage capacity of 21,021 gallons [120,450 pounds], and Tank 2 has a storage capacity of 20,880 gallons [119,642 pounds]. The storage tanks are located on the southeast corner of the production plant approximately 600 yards from the corner of the production facility.  The batch reactor tanks are located in a covered outdoor area on the southeast side of Plant 8 building.  MIPA is highly flammable, toxic, and caustic liquid with a density of 5.73 lb/gal, ph of 11.2, boiling point of 93\u00b0F, LEL of 2.3 ppm, and STEL of 10 ppm.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenario:  \r\n\r\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of the largest (21,021 gallon) MIPA storage tanks when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a toxic vapor cloud release. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite within a 6 mile radius from the release; there are approximately 9,495 public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternative release scenario is a break in a 2-inch diameter pipe during liquid transfer, leading to a 2-minute release resulting in a toxic vapor cloud formation.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite within a 4.1 mile radius from the release; there ar"
