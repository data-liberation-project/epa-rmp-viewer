The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson County Utility Authority's Emergency Response Plan is used to provide clear, consise directions during an emergency.  Its function is to prevent physical harm to the staff, the public, or the plant facilities.\r\n\r\nThis plan is a key to preparedness and was developed using EPA guidelines.  The Emergency Response Plan includes a series of action plans for specific situations and lists emergency supplies, emergency organizations, and emergency telephone numbers.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Response Plan is comprised of the following action plans for emergency situations:\r\n\r\n*  Emergency Telephone Numbers\r\n*  First Aid Procedures\r\n*  Chemical Emergencies\r\n*  Electrical Emergencies\r\n*  Weather Emergencies\r\n*  Material Safety Data Sheets\r\n\r\nInsofar as possible, every contingency has been covered under the Authority's Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nThe Authority's wastewater treatment facilities have safety systems for the prevention of an accidental release.  These systems include the following:\r\n\r\n*  Leak Detector System\r\n*  Call-Out System\r\n*  Safety Inspections\r\n\r\nThe leak detector system monitors the chlorine/sulfur dioxide storage area and the feed control station inside the building for chemical leaks.  In the event of a chlorine or sulfur dioxide leak, the leak detector will activate an audible alarm horn and warning light signifying the type of leak, chlorine or sulfur dioxide, and the leak location, storage area or control station.  The activated system will alert plant personnel, who are on duty 24 hours a day.  Plant personnel will then implement the necessary leak procedure as per the Emergency Response Plan.\r\n\r\nThe safety inspections are conducted by the Authority's Safety Committee on a semi-annual basis for overall plant safety and awareness.  Plant operators conduct monthly safety inspections on the chlorine"

Any discrepancies found during the inspections are corrected immediately.\r\n\r\nWith the use of these safety systems, the Authority provides safety of not only plant personnel, but the community around the facilities.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substance handled.\r\n\r\nPascagoula/Moss Point Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant treats domestic wastewater from the cities of Pascagoula and Moss Point.\r\n\r\nChlorine is applied to the treatment plant effluent for the purpose of disinfection and sulfur dioxide is used for chlorine removal prior to discharge to the Pascagoula River.\r\n\r\nThe facility stores two one-ton containers of chlorine and two one-ton containers of sulfur dioxide.  This  equates to a four month supply of chlorine and a three month supply of sulfur dioxide at present operating conditions.  The facility operates with one container of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on line and one container of chlorine and sulfur dixoide on standby.\r\n\r\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine, with a 10 minute release time.\r\n\r\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, class F stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0087 at a distance of 1.3 miles.\r\n\r\nThe residential population within this distance is 5,000.  Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include schools, prisons, recreational areas, industrial areas, state parks, and monuments.\r\n\r\nAlternate-case release scenario number one:\r\n\r\nThe alternate-case release scenario was based on the failure of a storage container containing 2,000 pounds of chlorine, with a 10 minute release time.\r\n\r\nUtilizing urban conditions with a wind speed of 3.0 meters per second, class D stability, the toxic end point would be 0.0087 at a distance of 0.3 miles.\r\n\r\nThe residen"

Public and environmental receptors within the distance that would be affected include business, recreational areas, and industrial areas.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is covered and partially enclosed.  This minimizes the potential for overheating of the ton container.\r\n\r\nThe gas feeder on the chlorine container is designed to shut off the supply of gas in case of a line breakage.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine/sulfur dioxide building is also equipped with a leak detector system.  In the event of a leak, the alarm will activate, alerting the plant personnel.  This provides for immediate response to a leak by plant personnel.\r\n\r\n4.  The acidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nThere are several key steps to the Pascagoula/Moss Point Regional Wastewater Treatment plant's prevention plan.\r\n\r\n*  Call-Out System\r\n*  Leak Detector System\r\n*  Safety Inspections\r\n*  Safety Training\r\n\r\n5.  Five-year accident history.\r\n\r\nThe Pascagoula/Moss Point Regional Wastewater Treatment plant has not had an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide over the past five years.\r\n\r\n6.  Emergency Response Program.\r\n\r\nThe Authority participates in the Community Right to Know, SARA Title III, Tier 2.  This is provided to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency, the Jackson County Civil Defense, and the Pascagoula Fire Department.\r\n\r\n7.  Safety Improvements.\r\n\r\nThe Authority installed new chlorination and declorination equipment in September, 2006.  Along with the new equipment, new chlorine and sulfur dioxide leak detectors were installed for enhanced monitoring of chlorine or sulfur dioxide leaks.  In 2002, a reduction in on hand quantities of chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the plant sight was implemented."
