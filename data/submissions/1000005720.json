      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Trinity River Authority of Texas (TRA) is a political subdivision charged by legislative mandate with three functions.  These include the maintenance of a Master Plan for basin-wide development, serving as a local sponsor for federal water projects, and providing services authorized by the Texas Legislature within TRA\u00c2\u00bfs defined territory that includes all or part of seventeen counties encompassing approximately 17,500 square miles. \n\nTRAs greatest impact to the general public is ownership and operation of several large water and wastewater treatment facilities.  TRA provides essential services to a significant portion of the public in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and to several cities around Lake Livingston.  As the operator of these facilities, it is TRA's duty to inform the public about efforts to prevent and, if necessary, respond if a hazardous substance were inadvertently released from one of our treatment facilities.  \n\nTRA's Huntsville Regional Water Supply System (HRWSS) began delivering treated water to the City of Huntsville in September of 1980.  This system, located north of Huntsville, provides service to a population of approximately 35,000 people.  Raw water for this project is supplied from nearby Lake Livingston.  The treatment process involves the usage of chemical additions to supplement mechanical procedures resulting in clear, clean, safe drinking water.  Chlorine is used for disinfection.  The facility has a peak design capacity of eight million gallons per day and is designed to allow for expansion as needed.  The facility provides quality drinking water of a standard that meets or exceeds all state and federal regulations.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nAs a result of federal requirements, 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP), the HRWSS is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) Program Level 2 due to the quantity of chlorine that it uses in its treatment process.

      "SummaryText": "developing its RMP, HRWSS has conducted an analysis of potential offsite consequences of an accidental release including a worst-case and alternative case release scenario.  In addition, the facility has compiled a five-year accidental release history, a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The HRWSS has an outstanding safety record and there have been no accidents related to the chlorine process in the past five years.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAMS\n\nHRWSS places the highest emphasis on safety and hazard prevention.  To this end, we have developed a comprehensive prevention program that includes the following key points:\n\n- Annual training is required by all operations and maintenance employees who work in and around hazardous chemical storage and loading areas.\n\n- Visual inspections of these covered processes are conducted by operations personnel on each shift.\n\n- Sensors and alarms are in place around all process areas to detect any leakage of the hazardous chemicals.\n\n- Written operating procedures are continuously updated and maintained for operations personnel to use during their work routines.\n\n- All accidents are investigated promptly with written documentation of all findings.  These accident investigations are reviewed by management and Certified Safety Professionals to determine cause and prevention.\n\n- Monthly safety audits are conducted of all plant process areas including covered process areas.  Written documentation of these monthly audits, including actions taken to correct problems, is maintained for a minimum of five years.\n\n- Preventative maintenance programs for covered processes are in place and a computerized records management system is in place to automatically generate reports regarding preventative maintenance needs and/or histories on all covered process equipment. \n\n- Project personnel on various safety issues that are pertinent to covered processes conduct monthly safety meetings.\n\nThese above procedures have resulted in"

The plans have been reviewed by the local Fire Departments and local Emergency Planning Committees.\n\nCOMMITMENT TO SAFETY AND OUR COMMUNITY\n\nTRA's continued commitment to the safety of our facilities and our communities is illustrated by our continuous improvement process.  Our facilities continue to take advantage of updated technology and advancements in the way we operate.  This includes site security.  Recent facility upgrades have included perimeter monitoring, security cameras, and policies and procedures to ensure access to our facilities is by authorized personnel only."
