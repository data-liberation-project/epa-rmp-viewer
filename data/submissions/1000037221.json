The current RMPlan was resisted on November7, 2008. This report provides the supporting\n\ndocumentation for the 5 year RMPlan renewal submittal.\n\n\n\nTo minimize the formation of oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Magnet Cove utilizes a Selective Catalytic Reduction\n\n(SCR) pollution control system. The SCR system adds ammonia to the exhaust stream over the catalyst to reduce\n\nNOx emissions to elemental nitrogen. The SCR system uses a maximum of 30 weight percent (wt %) aqueous\n\nammonia, stored in two 25,829 gallon tanks. The plant limits the maximum fill to 85% of the tank volume\n\n(21,955 gallons), equivalent to 49,295 lbs. of ammonia per tank. For the purpose of this assessment, the\n\nammonium hydroxide tanks are assumed to be completely filled to 85% of their total capacity.\n\n\n\nUnder the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions require\n\nfacilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management\n\nProgram, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to EPA. Covered facilities were initially\n\nrequired to comply with the rule in 1999, and the rule has been amended on several occasions since then, most\n\nrecently in 2004. Ammonium hydroxide is regulated under Title 40, Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations\n\n(40 CFR 68), more commonly known as the Risk Management Program (RMP) rule. RMP plans must be prepared\n\nfor processes that store in excess of the thresholds set forth by 40 CFR 68.130. For ammonium hydroxide\n\n(aqueous ammonia, CAS No. 764-41-7), the threshold is 20,000 lbs. of ammonia at 20% or stronger solution.1\n\nMagnet Cove stores approximately 21,955 gal of 30 weight percent ammonia (49,295 lbs. per tank).
