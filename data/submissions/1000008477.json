FACILITY POLICY:  The owners, management and employees of Farmers Cooperative Elevator of Ottosen, Iowa (the facility) are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Region V Emergency Management District and other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. FACILITY INFORMATION:  The facility is a country grain elevator which buys, stores and sells grain and provides inputs (fertilizer, seed, etc.) to local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. It is stored in two steel storage tanks, one 26,000 gallons and one 12,000 gallons, plus numerous nurse tanks of various sizes.  The maximum quantity stored on site would be about 440,000 pounds.\n\n3. WORST CASE AND ALTERNATE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  The worse case and alternate case release scenarios are not listed in the executive summary for security reasons. \n\n4. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:  The facility has been reviewed for general compliance with applicable standards for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia. Those standards include: the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI); US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) Part 21-Chapter 43-Rule 43.6(200), \"Standard for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".\n\n5. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidental releases of anydrous ammonia over the past five years that have cause"
