We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure continued operations with protection in environmental, health and safety (EHS) protection in mind.  This document provides a  brief overview of our comprehensive rick management activities to prevent or eliminate the possibilityof an acidental relase of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the relase of a regulated substance, however, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release.   We are also coordinated with the Houston area's Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0 Stationary Source  and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility cracks Naptha, OP-400, and Algerian condensates into a number of products that include 1,3-Butadiene, Isobutylene/Butene, Isoprene, Propylene, Isobutane and other olefins.  In addition, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) and an assortment of products are produced in the Mid Plant unit, including Methanol and Isopropanol.  There are two Olefins Cracking units and one East Plant/Mid Plant manufacturing unit.  These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identifed by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequencees in the event of their substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropylene: Approximately 1,500,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.  Propylene is refined in the Olefins.\n\n\n\nOlef"

The condensates include Algerian, OP-400, and Naptha condensate materials, depending in most part to the supplier.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIsobutylene: Approximately 1.1 million lbs. are contained in storage and within the East Plant process unit.  Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of MTBE.\n\n\n\n1,3-Butadiene: Approximately 3.5 million pounds of Butadiene are stored and in process within the East Plant.  Butadiene is further utilized on the Poly-Butadiene process are within the Mid Plant as well as sold as a finished product.\n\n\n\nN-Butane: Approximately 1.3 million lbs. are contained in storage and within the East Plant process unit.  N-Butane is an intermediate chemical and is sent to the Olefins Cracking Units for further processing.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nRegulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario - Olefins Condensate Storage Tank (Flammable Mixture)\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammables assumes the complete rupture of the isobutylene surge drum, releasing 26,620,000 lbs. of this flammable mixture into a diked area, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure.  The overpressure would extend beyond the fenceline 2.4mi. and affect approximately 6,000 people.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario - Propylene\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammables assumes a mechanical failure of a valve on the 4th stage suction drum on the Olefins 2 Propylene refrigeration system, resulting in a release of the entire compressor circuit.  The scenario also assumes that the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and that all active safety systems fail.  The total release wou"

Addiitonally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards as well as is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage, with the overall thougth of identifying and mitigating HSE issues before installation or operation.  Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any SOP training opportunity.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified after completed of a process PHA.  Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\n\n\nOperator Training / Certification Program: CVON has a training and testing program that ensures that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.  Periodic operator re-certification is required.\n\n\n\nComputerized Process Simulation: Computerized simulation programs are used for tr"

Plant and unit spefific proceduresfor servicing operating equipment are in place, including a preventive / predictive maintenance and reliability programs.\n\n\n\nMaintenance Training: CVON trains and test mechanics and other craftsmen who perform routine or complex maintenance tasks on process equipment and inspections on operating equipment to ensure they have the required knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity Program: Vessels (including shipping containers) and other process equipment, are periodically tested and inspected to ensure safe operations, following recognized standards and governmental requirements.  \n\n\n\nQuality Assurance: CVON has a system to ensure that purchased equipment and materials meet established engineering standards and specifications.\n\n\n\nProcess Change Authorizations (Management of Change / PCAs): CVON has a management sytem to ensure that modifications to a process or faclities are evaluated to ensure continued safe operations.  Design (DSRs) and Pre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs) are conducted for facility or process changes prior to implementation of the change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs): Reviews conducted just prior to startup to ensure that modified facilities or processes are safe to operate.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: CVON has a program to ensure that accidents, incidents, and near misses are properly investigated to determine the root cause as well as contributing causes.  In addition to the investigation, action items resulting from the investigation are communicated site-wide and tracked to completion to prevent recurrence.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits: CVON conducts audits on a regular basis to verify the provisions set forth under the PSM and RMP rules are being implemented.

Each operating area also has a representative on the Plant Safety Committee.\n\n\n\nContractor Safety Program: The plant has a program to ensure that contractors are properly trained, and uses the Houston Area Contractors Association as a tool to provide the basic HSE training required of a contractor prior to entering a chemical manufacturing facility.  All contractor employees must attend the Houston Area Contractors Association training and be certified through examination prior to arriving at the plant.  In addition to basic training CVON site specific training is required prior to arriving at the plant.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of specific substances regulated under the RMP rule at this facility over the last 5 years.  However, there was a release of Benzene from the Benzene NESHAPS tank on July 28, 2001 that resulted in an off-site impact and the closure of roads along the CVON facility.  The NRC case number for this incident was #574651.  Benzene is not listed specifically as a toxic, and the mixture in the NESHAPS tank is not flammable, that is why the incident was not identified in the resubmitted RMP, but rather put here in the Executive Summary.  As a result of the incident investigation, there were 6 action items to prevent recurrence of this incident and all were completed during the Olefins 1&2 Turnarounds in 2003\n\n\n\nEmergency Response\n\n\n\nCVON maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  This program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, CVON coordinates with the community response plan through the North Channel"
