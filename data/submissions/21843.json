We have implemented a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect the environment.  These programs include both Union Carbide?s Responsible Care? requirements and governmental requirements, such as the Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP).\n2    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Union Carbide Massey Rail Yard is used to temporarily store tank cars for eventual processing at the South Charleston Plant or for eventual transport to other locations.  The rail yard is managed by the South Charleston Plant, but is not considered contiguous  with the South Charleston Plant.  No chemical loading or unloading takes place at the Massey Rail Yard.  The RMP rule requires that if a facility, such as the Massey Rail Yard, has a specific amount (threshold) or more of any one of 140 toxic and flammable chemicals, the facility must follow the RMP rule requirements.  \n\nThere are no Union Carbide-owned EPA RMP regulated toxic chemicals stored in the Massey Rail Yard.\n\nUnion Carbide owns and stores threshold quantities of the following EPA RMP-regulated flammable substances in the Massey Rail Yard:\n\nDimethylamine\nMethylamine:    \nVinyl Methyl Ether:      \nAcetaldehyde:    \n3    Key Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPA?s RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these hypothetical scenarios.  Unless otherwise specified, no credit was taken for administrative controls or mitigation measures in evaluating the off-site"

According to EPA?s Off-Site Consequence Analysis (OCA) Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors. \nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring include:\n? Safety Relief Device:  These devices relieve pressure at a pre-determined set point to prevent over pressurization of the railroad tank car.\n? Cameras:  These cameras can be used by security to detect leaks.\n? Surveillance: Yard clerks, RESCAR employees and security routinely monitor the rail yard.\n? Fire Water Spray Monitors: Area fire water spray monitors can be used to help suppress dimethylamine vapors.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario \n\nThis scenario assumes a safety relief valve fails and prematurely opens on a railroad tank car, releasing methylamine at a rate of 9,940 lbs. per minute for 16.4 minutes as a gas to the atmosphere (entire tank contents), leading to a vapor cloud explosion.  According to the OCA Guidance Table, this release could impact off-site public receptors.\nSpecific steps to prevent this scenario from occurring include:\n?

Key elements include:\n\nEquipment Design: Tank cars and associated equipment are designed according to recognized industry standards and/or governmental requirements.\nProcess Safety Information:  Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, maintained up-to-date, and available to operating personnel.\nProcess Hazard Analysis:  Process hazard analyses are conducted every five years to identify major process hazard scenarios and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.\nEpisodic Risk Management System:  Periodic reviews are conducted to identify hazards which could have significant community impact and to recommend corrective action(s) needed to prevent their occurrence.  These reviews utilize advanced quantitative risk assessment techniques.\nOperating Procedures:  Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a rail yard and are maintained up-to-date.\nOperator Training:  All rail equipment operators are trained according to government requirements.\nMaintenance Procedures:  Procedures exist for maintaining tank cars and railroad track.\nMechanical Integrity Program:  Tank cars and associated equipment are periodically tested and inspected, following recognized standards and/or government requirements.\nManagement of Change:  Management systems exist  to ensure that modified tank cars and rail track meet government requirements and are safe for operation.\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews:  Reviews are conducted"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response including:\n? Proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures \n? Evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation\n? Notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs\n? Post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements, and\n? Inspecting, testing, maintaining, and using emergency response equipment.\nThe emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the facility.\n\nThe South Charleston Plant maintains a trained emergency squad to handle fires, explosions, toxic vapor releases, spills, and medical emergencies.   The plant emergency squad trains and drills with local emergency responders to enhance their skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.  Critiques are held on drills and actual events.  In addition to the plant emergency squad, Union Carbide staffs a Hazardous Emergency Leaks Prevention (HELP ) team in the Kanawha Valley that responds to accidental releases from transportation equipment throughout the continental United States.  \n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.
