Details such as\n  Maximum Intended Inventory, Safe Upper and Lower Temperatures, Safe Upper and Lower\n  Pressures, and Codes and Standards Used to Design, Build and Operate the Process are\n  provided in this section.

The Hazard Review technique\n  used was a hybrid Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP), in the form of a What If analysis.\n  The What If was developed from HAZOP experience at similar chlorine systems.  The Hazard\n  Review team consisted of plant management, process operating and maintenance experts,\n  outside process design engineers, and consultants knowledgeable in the Hazard Review process\n  itself.\n\n  Recommendations\n  The result of the Hazard Review is a set of recommendations for the plant to implement.

Training on process fundamentals, operations, and\n  maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential\n  hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\n  An Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included.

The\n  Hazard Assessment is provided in Chapters 1 through 3.\n\n  Worst Case Scenario\n  The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) for the chlorine system is defined as a 55-ton railcar (110,000\n  pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration.  This\n  scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP Comp model. The toxic\n  endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 9.9 miles by RMP Comp at the 3 ppm concentration\n  specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for\n  up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n  \n  The WCS for the ammonia system (10,000 gallon tank - 80% full) is defined as 8,000 gallons\n  (45,520 lbs) of ammonia being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration.  This\n  scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model\n  SLAB.
