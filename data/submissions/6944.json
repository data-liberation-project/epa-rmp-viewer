An outline of the Risk Management Program is provided in Figure ES-1. \n  The disinfection process (i.e., chlorine system) is covered under this regulation at the Sewerage\n  and Water Board of New Orleans (S&WB) Carrollton Water Purification Plant (WPP). \n\n  To meet the regulation requirements, this binder contains useful information on the chlorine and\n  ammonia systems.  The technical information herein may be used as a training reference in\n  initial and recurring operator and maintenance training.  Training on process fundamentals, operations, and\n  maintenance, coupled with the recommended process modifications discussed below, will reduce the potential\n  hazards to plant personnel and the surrounding community.\n\n  An Emergency Response Program and an Incident Investigation Program are included.  These two programs should be\n  an integral part of both initial and recurring training.\n \n  A Risk Management Plan (RMP), in the format required by the EPA, is included at the end of the main body of this\n  document.  It consists of a summary of data elements as required by EPA for\n  inclusion in a public access database.  The RMP is intended to inform the public of Carrollton\n  WPP's proactive stance toward protection of the environment and the surrounding community.\n\n  Hazard Assessment\n  The Hazard Assessment is comprised of a Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenario for the\n  chlorine system, as well as a 5-Year Accident History for the same. The Hazard Assessment was\n  conducted as an initial screening procedure as part of determining which Program Level (I, II, or\n  III) the Carrollton WPP falls.

The Carrollton\n  Water Purification Plant is operated by public personnel and therefore excluded from Program\n  III.  Carrollton Water Purification Plant is included in Risk Management Program II.  The\n  Hazard Assessment is provided in Chapters 1 through 3.\n\n  Worst Case Scenario\n  The Worst Case Scenario (WCS) for the chlorine system is defined as a 55-ton railcar (110,000\n  pounds) of chlorine being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration.  This\n  scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved RMP Comp model. The toxic\n  endpoint for chlorine was determined to be 9.9 miles by RMP Comp at the 3 ppm concentration\n  specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a person may be exposed for\n  up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n  \n  The WCS for the ammonia system (10,000 gallon tank - 80% full) is defined as 8,000 gallons\n  (45,520 lbs) of ammonia being released by a catastrophic event within a 10 minute duration.  This\n  scenario was developed and modeled using the EPA approved dense gas dispersion model\n  SLAB.  The toxic endpoint for ammonia was determined to be 0.83 miles by the SLAB model at\n  the 200 ppm concentration specified by the EPA.  It should be noted that at this concentration, a\n  person may be exposed for up to one hour without suffering permanent injuries (ERPG-2).\n  Alternative Release Scenario\n\n  The Alternative Release Scenario (ARS) of chlorine was modeled using RMP Comp. An\n  estimation of approximately 3983 pounds of chlorine gas released was derived from the scenario\n  of a flexible connection failure.  The toxic endpoint for the chlorine system ARS was determined\n  to be 0.8 miles.\n\n  The alternative release scenario of ammonia was also modeled using SLAB.  An estimation of\n  approximately 2700 pounds of ammonia released was derived from the scenario of an outdoors\n  piping failure.  The to"

In 1998 a\n  minor release of chlorine occurred due to a check valve that cracked during rail car\n  disconnection.  The crack separated the valve from the rest of the piping and allowed chlorine to\n  escape into the atmosphere.  Four employees were exposed to chlorine gas during the release,\n  however, all four were wearing protective equipment and escaped serious injury.  There were\n  no off-site consequences or impacts caused by this incident.\n\n  Management Program\n  The Management Program consists of the Document Management System described below:\n\n  Document Management System\n  A Document Management System was established to attribute responsibility for the\n  development, implementation, and maintenance of the Risk Management Program. The\n  Program must be updated every three years, or any time a covered process undergoes a physical\n  or administrative modification.  The Document Management System is largely a function of the\n  Risk Management Program Team, described below in Table ES-1.\n\n  Risk Management Program Team\n  Tables ES-1 lists the employees responsible for the Risk Management Program development,\n  implementation, and maintenance. The Plant Superintendent has the ultimate responsibility.\n\n  Prevention Program\n  The Prevention Program is more appropriately entitled the Accidental Release Prevention Program.  It is comprised of Safety\n  Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Maintenance, Incident Investigation, and Compliance Audit\n  procedures.  Each has an entire chapter devoted to it in this RMP, and is described in\n  more detail below.\n\n  Safety Information\n  Safety Information is divided between Chemical Safety Information and Process Safety Information.
