Genevieve, Mo. 63670\nContact:     Mike Markway\nPhone:         573-883-3538\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\nMFA Incorporated and the employees of the MFA Anhydrous Plant in Ste. Genevieve are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Ste. Genevieve Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient.\n\nThe facility has one 30,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum handling would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck with approximately 50,000 pounds.  \n\n\n3. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1999\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., the Missouri Anhydrous Ammonia regulations and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". The facility will work at meeting the newest code as time and budgets will allow.\n\n\n4. The Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n        a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard, 29 CFR \n          1910.38; \n          \n        b. provided State and "
