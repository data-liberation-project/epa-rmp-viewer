      "SummaryText": "The LANXESS Corporation Memphis Oxone Plant is located north of Memphis in the Lucy-Woodstock area of Shelby County, near the intersection of Hwy 51 and Fite Rd.  The LANXESS plant was formerly owned by Chemours and is located inside the larger Chemours chemical production site area.\n\nThe LANXESS Memphis Plant produces Oxone, a dry non-chlorine based oxidizer used primarily in the water treatment and home products industries.\n\nThe LANXESS Memphis Plant is committed to operating and maintaining all of the processes in a safe and responsible manner.  This document provides a brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities.\n\n\n\n1. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESONSE POLICIES\n\nThe LANXESS Corporation philosophy is that all incidents, including environmental releases, can be prevented. The plant works with both local off site emergency responders and Chemours site emergency responders to prevent or minimize offsite impacts in the unlikely event of a spill or release.\n\n2. REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nIn the LANXESS Memphis Plant, one chemical (Oleum, Fuming Sulfuric Acid) meets the criteria for the Risk Management Plan reporting threshold.  \n\n3. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nEmployee health, safety, process safety, security, and environmental protection are core values of LANXESS, as outlined in our North American HSEQ Policy.  \n\nThe LANXESS Memphis Plant has a fully established process safety program in place.  This program consists of multiple preventive elements specifically focused on preventing significant releases of process materials.  Below are some examples of measures to prevent releases and reduce the impact of releases that may occur:\n\na)    Plant equipment is designed  specifically for the process and to minimize the probability of a leak or spill.\n\nb)    Safety controls such as instrumentation, warning alarms, monitoring equipment, and automatic shutdown systems are installed.\n\nc)    Detai"

      "SummaryText": "led process hazard analyses are performed or revalidated on a periodic basis.\n\nd)    Routine audits of the process and safety programs are conducted.\n\ne)    Routine equipment inspection, testing,  and maintenance are conducted to ensure proper operation and continued integrity.\n\nf)    Training and testing of operators and mechanics is conducted to ensure proper use of documented operating and maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThe LANXESS Memphis Plant has not had a release of oleum in the past five years that met the RMP five-year accident criteria  In addition, this year the LANXESS Memphis Plant celebrated five years without an OSHA recordable injury.\n\n\n\n5. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe LANXESS Memphis Plant has a comprehensive Emergency Action Plan that helps protect the health of the public and our employees and prevent harm to the environment.  The plan establishes the plant's emergency response, training, and preparation as well as its involvement with the site emergency response program.  As previously mentioned, the LANXESS Memphis Plant coordinates closely with Chemours site emergency responders and local offsite emergency responders.\n\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe LANXESS Memphis Plant practices continual improvement.  Periodic process hazard analyses  provide a mechanism for assessing and improving process safety and risk management.  The plant is planning several upgrades to process equipment in the next few years.\n\n"
