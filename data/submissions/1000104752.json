The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA\u2019s Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA\u2019s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation. This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n4. Five-year accident history:\n\nThe facility is new with no current operating history, therefore there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable gas or that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u2019s emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u2019s HAZWOPER standard. At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from outside agencies. They have been trained to OSHA\u2019s First Responder Awareness Level. The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan. Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the local emergency response team.\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:\n\nThe facility resolves recommendations from Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs) and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operating procedures."

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous hydrogen and steam. The amount of Hydrogen handled by our facility is considered hazardous by the EPA. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations. Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g. alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u2019s HAZWOPER regulation. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of Texas City Emergency Management and Texas City Industrial Mutual Aid System (IMAS) so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u2019s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the manufacturing of gaseous hydrogen and steam. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as feedstock. The feedstock is reacted in the reformer furnace. By exposing the feedstock to a catalyst in the presence of heat (approximately 1,600 degrees F) and steam, a chemical reaction takes place that converts the feedstock into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are then separated from th"
