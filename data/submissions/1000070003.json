      "SummaryText": "Marathon Oil produces oil and gas from the Sherman pad. The Sherman pad is located approximately 6 miles SW of Four Bears village, ND. As part of this operation, additional processing equipment (a natural gas liquids skid) has been installed to assist with State mandated gas capture requirements. This additional processing equipment removes and compresses natural gas liquids from the gas stream that would otherwise be flared. The natural gas liquids are stored onsite in bullet tanks and removed\n\nby truck for onward sales.\n\n\n\nBased on an applicability assessment conducted by a 3rd party, the Sherman pad is a program level 1 facility under the EPA Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68 as there are no dwellings within 0.3m radius. This is anticipated to be a temporary operation through 2018 after which Marathon anticipates decommissioning of the NGL facility."
