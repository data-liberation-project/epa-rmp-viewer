This commitment is demonstrated by the release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is DEQP's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If a release does occur, operations personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release, as applicable within their level of training and ability; however, the facility is classified as non-responding.  DEQP has contracted Clean Harbors as an Oil/Spill Response Organization to provide additional emergency response expertise as needed.  Also, as a non-responding facility, DEQP will contact the Carbon County Dispatch to obtain additional resources including the local volunteer fire department, law enforcement, and emergency medical services depending on the seriousness of an incident.\n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\n\n\nStationary Source, Regulated Substances Handled, and Covered Process:\n\nPrice Raptor DPP is a natural gas extraction plant that receives natural gas and processes it to remove heavier hydrocarbons from the gas.

The residue gas (primarily methane) is compressed and sent back to DEQP's transmission pipeline system for delivery to downstream customers.  The mixed natural gas liquid (NGL) product containing pentane, isopentane [butane, 2-methyl], butane, isobutane [propane, 2-methyl], propane, and ethane is sent to one of four 30,000-gallon product storage tanks.  The tanks are administratively controlled to 90% of capacity or a maximum of 27,000-gallons each (108,000 gallons in total).  The NGL product is a flammable mixture that meets the NFPA-4 criteria and is present onsite in a process, in an amount, that exceeds the threshold quantity (10,000 pounds) for applicability under the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  Also, the propane refrigerant is stored in two 2000-gallon pressurized tanks that collectively exceed the 10,000-pound threshold quantity for a flammable substance, and therefore, are subject to RMP.  No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are present at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\n\n\nDEQP has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  Price Raptor DPP is also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and is classified as a Program 3 process under USEPA's RMP.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that are in place at the facility.  These elements of the RMP program are documented in DEQP Standard Practice 4-00-02 (General PSM-RMP procedures) and Standard Practice 4-54-05a (Price Raptor specific RMP).\n\n\n\nProcess S"

Much of this information was compiled during preparation of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  The OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers, distributors, or importers to provide SDSs to communicate the hazards of hazardous chemical products.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - DEQP personnel conduct comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the regulated process are identified and controlled efficiently.  DEQP primarily uses the HAZOP method analysis, supplemented by Checklist techniques, to perform these hazard evaluations.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n \n\nOperating Procedures - For the purposes of safely conducting activities within the covered process, DEQP maintains written operating procedures in Standard Practice 4-54-05 that provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities involved in each covered process consistent with process safety.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.

Initial employee training is provided, and refresher training is conducted at least every three years or more frequently as needed.  Employee training is documented, and a record of training is maintained onsite for at least three years.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - Written procedures in Standard Practice 4-54-05 are in place for maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment, which incorporate training for process maintenance activities, inspection and testing, corrective action for equipment deficiencies, and the application of quality assurance measures. Documented maintenance checks are carried out on process equipment to ensure proper operation and maintenance.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, and controls and pumps.  Qualified and trained personnel carry out maintenance operations at the site.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  Price Raptor DPP also incorporates quality assurance measures to ensure that equipment and parts are suitable for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction and installed equipment meet design specifications, and that safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits - Regularly scheduled audits are conducted to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being properly implemented.  The audits are conducted by at least one person knowledgeable in the process and are conducted at least every three years.  Audit findings are documented in a report and corrective actions are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  Price Raptor DPP maintains a record of the two most recent compliance audit reports, as applicable. \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation - Any incident that results in or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance is promptly investigated.  An incident investigation is initiated as promptly as possible, but no later than 48 hours after the incident, and will involve at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved. \n\nAn investigation is undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a release from reoccurring.

The permit will be kept on file until completion of the hot work operations.  DEQP hot work procedures are governed by Standard Practice 8-20-03.\n\n\n\nContractors - DEQP hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out and before any contractors perform work at Price Raptor DPP, they undergo an orientation.  During this orientation contractors are made aware of the known potential hazards related to the work, the hazards of regulated substances, and the safe work procedures insisted on by DEQP.  In addition, they are familiarized with the Hot Work Permit Policy and the Lock Out/Tag Out Procedures.  Contractors are further informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Emergency response information includes evacuation routes and personnel assembly points.  DEQP documents that all contract personnel have received the training and understand its importance and purpose.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps - The covered processes at Price Raptor DPP present hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.
