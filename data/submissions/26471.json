It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the West Union Fire Dept. ( a 911 call ) and request a response to the emergency.  A follow-up call will be made to the Fayette Co. LEPC.\n\nA real emergency will be unexpected and may be very different in nature from any training in the past.  However, any previous planning/training will serve as guidelines to follow.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator is Randy Osmundson.  His work and 24 hr. Emergency number  is listed in the Registration Section of this document  Additional contacts are listed below in order:\n        Randy Osmundson, owner\n        Work:  (563) 422-6281    24hr: (563) 419-9110\n\n        Ron Seitz, operations\n        Work:  (563) 422-6281    24hr:  (563) 419-9107\n\n        Scott Peterson.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of (1) 30,000 gal storage tank with associated piping, valves, etc., as well as several portable tank units.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the 30,000 gal tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form.  The distance to endpoint is 3.8 miles.\n\nThe a"

The anhydrous ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with ANSI Standards and State law.\n\nIn addition, the company has specific operating procedures in place intended to minimize the potential for an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Northern Ag Service, Inc. encourages local officials to visit our anhydrous ammonia plant and to become familiar with specific anhydrous ammonia health hazards.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nNorthern Ag Service, Inc., West Union, Iowa has not experienced accidental release involving anhydrous ammonia in the last five years that caused death, injuries,  evacuations, property or environmental damage.\n\n\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammonia system, it is the policy of Northern Ag Service, Inc., to immediately contact the West Union Fire Deptl and the Fayette County LEPC.  Members of the fire department and the LEPC are invited to regularly visit and inspect our anhydrous ammonia plant.  In addition, photographs of our plant have been made available to the local fire and police departments.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nOur overall plan is to minimize hazards to human health and to the environment that are associated with accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Employees working with the anhydrous ammonia system make routine observations and inspections prior to and during transfer operations of the anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to nurse tanks, enabling them to detect problems early before they can cause a hazardous situation.
