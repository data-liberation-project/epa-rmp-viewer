It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately notify the West Union Fire Dept. ( a 911 call ) and request a response to the emergency.  A follow-up call will be made to the Fayette Co. LEPC.\n\nA real emergency will be unexpected and may be very different in nature from any training in the past.  However, any previous planning/training will serve as guidelines to follow.\n\nThe primary emergency coordinator is Randy Osmundson.  His work and 24 hr. Emergency number  is listed in the Registration Section of this document  Additional contacts are listed below in order:\n        Randy Osmundson, owner\n        Work:  (563) 422-6281    24hr: (563) 419-9110\n\n        Ron Seitz, operations\n        Work:  (563) 422-6281    24hr:  (563) 419-9107\n\n        Scott Peterson.

The anhydrous ammonia that is stored at this facility is distributed to agricultural crop producers in the surrounding area who utilize the anhydrous ammonia for crop nutrient purposes.\n\nThe system consists of (1) 30,000 gal storage tank with associated piping, valves, etc., as well as several portable tank units.  The anhydrous ammonia plant is operated on a seasonal basis (Spring and Fall).\n\nTHE WORST-CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\n\nThe worst-case scenario is the failure of the 30,000 gal tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85% of capacity), resulting in the release of the total volume in a gaseous (hazardous ammonia vapor cloud) form.  The distance to endpoint is 3.8 miles.\n\nThe a"
