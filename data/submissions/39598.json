Phibro-Tech, Inc. recycles spent materials nationwide through a network of four Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)-permitted plants, located in California, Illinois, South Carolina, and Texas.\n\nPhibro-Tech, Inc.?s Joliet Facility has been a chemical processing plant since 1972.  The 1.6 acre Facility is currently receiving non-ignitable, non-reactive metal bearing inorganic wastes to be recycled on-site or transferred to other facilities.  Ammonia (anhydrous) is used in the recycling processes.  All wastes received are stored in permitted hazardous waste containers and tanks.  The hazardous waste management units at the Facility consist of the following:\n\n- Two indoor container storage areas, one in the East Warehouse and one in the West Warehouse, where wastes are stored prior to being processed.\n- Two existing tank storage areas.  There are twelve tanks in Tank Storage Area #1 and one in Tank Storage Area #2.                            \nThe Plant Manager is responsible for day-to-day operations at the Facility.  The Plant Manager?s duties include: managing personnel requirements, scheduling and coordinating plant production and material flow, developing job safety practices, ensuring day-to-day compliance with all applicable regulations and permits, maintaining all required documents and records, and implementing and coordinating Contingency Plan procedures.  The Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) Manager position includes developing and implementing management systems and programs to support operations at the site; duties include developing policies and procedures, conducting compliance audits and inspections, preparing and presenting training programs, consulting to the company's sale personnel, consult and support management projects on design, construction and modifi"

Joliet Facility conducts routine inspections of the facility with emphasis placed on maintaining operational effectiveness of monitoring, safety, security, and structural equipment.  These inspections are conducted in order to protect against the release of hazardous waste, which may threaten human health and/or the environment.  The ?Facility Inspection Schedule?  identifies aspects of the facility, which directly or indirectly affect hazardous waste management operations and therefore require routine inspection and maintenance.  In addition, the facility inspection schedule identifies the inspection frequency and the types of possible deficiencies that may be encountered.\n\nThe Joliet Facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Program for Ammonia (anhydrous).   \n\nThe Joliet Facility does not accept waste streams containing organics, ignitable or reactive wastes.  After laboratory analysis is performed a Facility Waste Type Code is assigned to each container, truck, or tank car shipment.  The Facility Waste Type Code determines movement of the container to either the east or west warehouse storage areas or transfer of the waste to a specific hazardous waste storage tanks.  Containers of incompatible waste will not be stored within the same warehouse.  Incompatible wastes will not be transferred to tanks within the same secondary containment structure.\n\nThe current RCRA Part B Permit requires the facility to implement the contingency plan when the outside monitors register more than 50 ppm for ammonia. The facility no longer receives shipments of liquid chlorine in bulk.\n\nMost releases of hazardous waste would be expected to be minor (less than one drum) and could be cleaned up with dry absorbent materials; a neutralizing agent; and/or manually collected by pumping liquids from the floor trench or picking up solids.
