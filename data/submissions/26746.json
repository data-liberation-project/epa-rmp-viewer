FACILITY RMP PLAN\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc. is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  Founded in 1924, UNIVAR supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by UNIVAR are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  VOPAK USA Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to UNIVAR facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  UNIVAR responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders in the event of all other incident"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have two RMP regulated substances present at our facility.  The substance are Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70% and Aqueos Ammonia 30%.  Listed below is the way the RMP regulated substances are stored/handled on site and the maximum inventory present at any one time.\n\n1. Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid (Hydrofluoric) 70% is received in 55 gal drums which are stored in our warehouse for distribution to end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Hydrofluoric Acid 70% onsite at any one time will be 44000 lbs\n\n2. Ammonia Aqueous 30% is received in bulk by tank truck and off loaded into a 15,000 gal storage tank. The Ammonia Aqueous is then repackaged into 55 gal and 330 gal containers and moved into storage for distribution to our end use customers. In addition to the repackaging of smaller containers we also load tank trucks from our 15,000 gal storage tank for distribution to our end use customers. The estimated maximum inventory of Ammonia Aqueous 30% onsite at any one time will be 64,948 lbs \n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up, tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenarios submitted for Program 2 and 3 substances as a class involves separate catastrophic releases from each of the RMP substances in inventory onsite."

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.

For each Alternate Release Scenario onsite Emergency Response Personnel and Equipment were considered for active mitigation. RMP COMP software was used for modeling purposes. \n\n1. Worse Case Scenario release of 33,660 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of 1 mile is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .14 mg/L.\n\n2. Alternate Case Scenario release of 450 lbs Ammonia Aqueous 30%, the maximum distance of <1 mile is obtained using class D stability and 3m/s wind speed.\n\n3. Worse Case Scenario release of 385 lbs Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, the maximum distance of 1mile is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of .016 mg/L.\n\n4. Alternate Case Scenario release of 175 lbs Hydrogen Fluoride/Hydrofluoric Acid 70%, the maximum distance of <1 mile is obtained using Class D stability and 3m/s wind speed.       \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.This  facility is subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nUNIVAR USA Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes"
