The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release of Hydrocyanic Acid from the SARCOSINE - Glycolonitrile Process.  In this scenario, a sizeable quantity of Hydrocyanic Acid is released from the railcar.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity is 100% of the maximum capacity of the source. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Program 3 toxic substances involves a release from Anhydrous Ammonia storage.  The scenario involves the release anhydrous ammonia from a relief valve for a duration of 1 minute. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrocyanic Acid involves a release from SARCOSINE - Glycolonitrile Process.  The scenario involves the release of smaller quantity of Hydrocyanic Acid.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 1 minute.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by continuously manning the operation. \nThe alternative release scenario for Phosphorus Trichloride involves a release from HAMPOSYL-L process.  The scenario involves the release of 858 lb. of Phosphorous Trichloride.  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 40 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as dike(s) are taken into account to calculate the scenario.
