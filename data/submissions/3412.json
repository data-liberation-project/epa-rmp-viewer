      "SummaryText": "The Long Prairie Packing facility located in Long Prairie, Minnesota is a beef processing facility that  handles ammonia, which is considered toxic by EPA. The primary purpose of this facility is to slaughter and debone cattle for distribution for further processing.\n\nAmmonia is used at the facility to refrigerate areas to maintain a safe storage and processing of food products.  Ammonia is a valuable chemical used in the facility refrigeration system, providing the means to remove heat from the products being handled.  Ammonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from areas within the facility.\n\nSince ammonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the chemical to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program has been in place since about 1990. The facility was constructed using the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with state codes.  The facility was recently expanded and updated (1998) which included replacing an evaporative condenser located on the roof.  This food processing facility complies with EPAs Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. \n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program based on materials from the IIAR, a nationally recognized authority in ammonia refrigeration.  This program consists of having an effective preventative maintenance program and"

      "SummaryText": " comprehensive employee training to insure adequate response to equipment integrity.  The facility has a plan to replace, inspect and / or test safety relief valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR and / or by ASHRAE 15.  \n\nOur emergency response program is based upon federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Long Prairie Fire Department and other agencies involved with a response.  Representatives of the Long Prairie Fire Department visited this plant on a periodic basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to minimize any ammonia release.  These trained staff are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the past 5 years related to the ammonia.  Furthermore, there have been no reportable releases at this facility in the past 5 years.  \n\nIn regards to the worst case release scenario for ammonia as defined by EPA, the worst case release scenario for ammonia from the high pressure receiver would travel beyond the facility property boundaries.  An alternative, more likely, release scenario could travel just beyond the facility boundary, but not in all directions.  \n\nIn all cases, of a potential release, the extent of downwind areas affected is dependent on the amount of chemical released, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, etc.."
