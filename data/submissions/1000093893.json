The RMP is required under the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Accidental Release Provisions for Hazardous Chemicals), a.k.a. Risk Management Program (RMP). The PSM Program is required under the provisions in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan is to identify and prevent the potential accidental release of specific \"regulated substances\" that have the potential to cause harm to the public and the environment outside the property boundaries.  \"Regulated substances\" are flammable and toxic chemicals and materials identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation codified in Part 68 of Chapter 40 Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR Part 68).  Savage Railport - Mossville, LA has quantities of one \"regulated substance\" above the 40 CFR Part 68 applicability threshold amount for Flammable Mixtures listed below in Section 2 of this Summary.\n\n\n\nThe remainder of the Executive Summary is organized as follows:\n\n\n\nSection 1: Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nSection 2: Overview of Regulated Substances \n\nSection 3: Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nSection 4: Five-year Accidental Release Summary\n\nSection 5: Emergency Response Program\n\nSection 6: Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n1 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n \n\nEquipment at the facility must be designed, operated, and maintained in full compliance with applicable engineering standards, accepted industry codes, or industry standards.

Railcars will be received by the railyard and kept until they depart for their final destination.  \n\n\n\nRMP-regulated substances to be handled are limited to Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LOG), which is mixtures of Propane and Butane.  No other RMP-regulated flammable or toxic substances are expected to present onsite in quantities exceeding the respective RMP applicability thresholds.  The regulated substances will be found in railcars disconnected from locomotive power.  No blending or processing of the materials will take place at the railyard.\n\n\n\nThe entire area is classified as a single RMP-regulated process.  This process is qualified as a Program 2 facility per the RMP rule. \n\n\n\n3 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \n\n\n\nThe Savage Transportation Management, Inc. Director of Operations has the overall responsibility for the site and utilizes an internal staff of Team Members, combined with environmental, health, and safety consultants to maintain compliance with all aspects of the plant's Risk Management Plan.  In addition, all railyard personnel are trained to be responsible for carrying out their respective duties in a safe manner using established and verified procedures.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Savage Railport - Mossville, LA Facility maintains technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operations of t"

This information is kept current by the application of management of change and pre-startup safety review procedures, which are described further in this document.\n\n\n\nThis information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nHazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Savage Railport - Mossville, LA Facility conducts hazard review to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled.  Under this program, the process is systematically examined by a multi-disciplinary team to identify hazards that could result in an accidental release of a regulated substance and to ensure that adequate control is in place to manage those hazards.  The Savage Railport - Mossville, LA Facility utilized the Hazardous Operation (HAZOP) methodology for the facility's first hazard review. Pertinent parameters, such as process parameters, ongoing equipment mechanical integrity/reliability and redundant safety controls were examined. \n\n\n\nIn order to help ensure that the process controls or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Savage Railport - Mossville, LA Facility will update and revalidate the hazard review every five years.

The written operating procedures address the various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and initial startup of a new process.\n\n\n\nThese procedures are utilized by the experienced operators during training sessions to ensure consistent application by new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them to reflect changes made through the management of change process and through annual reviews and certification.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nThe Savage Railport - Mossville, LA Facility's operating procedures require personnel to be trained in the safe operation of the facility processes, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), the management of potential process deviations and emergency response, if required.  Understanding of the process and how to operate the process safely can minimize the potential for unplanned incidents or releases.\n\n\n\nTeam Members are trained according to the applicable requirements before they are allowed presenting in the area and receive refresher training on the operating procedures associated with the regulated chemical processes annually.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\n\n\nA comprehensive maintenance program requires routine inspection and testing of process equipment, instrumentation, and shipping containers.  Periodic reviews and auditing of the proper implementation of this program requires participation of maintenance, operations, and management staff.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\n\n\nTo ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning as intended, the Savage Railport - Mossville, LA Facility will contract independent auditors at three-year intervals.
