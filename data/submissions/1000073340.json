This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  The policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release. \n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Hill County 1 facility, located approximately 8 miles south of Havre in Hill County, Montana, operates a propane refrigeration plant to extract liquid petroleum products from raw natural gas.  The plant products include pipeline quality natural gas (primarily methane) and natural gas liquids comprised of ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and heavier hydrocarbons, some of which are regulated flammable substances.  The process to represent all regulated flammable substances at the Hill County 1 facility which contain above the threshold quantity is as follows:\n\n\n\n?Product Storage Tank comprised of C2+ mixture\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention and Program Information\n\n\n\nHill County 1 is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP).  Hills County 1 is not considered to be a PSM facility.  Hill County 1 is classified as a \"normally unoccupied remote facility\" as per the definition found in 29 CFR 1910.119(b) and thus is not applicable to PSM requirements according to 29 CFR 1910.119(a)(2)(iii).  However, should this status change, Hill County 1 must be re-evaluated for PSM applicability.      \n\n\n\nHPC encourages employees to participate in safety and accident prevention.

This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nHPC has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nHill County 1 maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed.  \n\n\n\nPersonnel are properly trained according to the facility operating procedures for process operations. Hill County 1 has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in facility operations.  Refresher training is conducted on an as needed basis.  All of this training is documented for each operator.\n\n\n\nAll maintenance personnel should be aware that the equipment may contain flammable hydrocarbons, high pressure gasses & liquids; hot surfaces may be present and there may be other hazards at the site.  All personnel must review SDS sheets if they are not familiar with the substances at the site.

The program consists of procedures for responding to the release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Hill County 1 is coordinated with the Hill County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Hill County 1 has around-the-clock communications capability.  HPC operators are automatically called in the event of a process upset.
