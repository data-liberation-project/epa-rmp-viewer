This commitment is reflected in the design, operation, maintenance, and procedures used to operate the facility. Calleguas has used chlorine gas safely since 1964 and aqueous ammonia safely since 1995.  The focus of Calleguas policies are to operate and maintain the disinfection system of the Grimes Canyon Wellfield Disinfection Facility in such a way as to protect Calleguas employees, the surrounding communities and the environment from a chlorine or ammonia leak.  The policies incorporate the highest level of commitment to establishing safety by insuring multiple, redundant and parallel layers of safety.  The equipment is engineered for safety, procedures are developed for safe operation, safety is incorporated into training, employees are provided personal protective equipment, and emergency response procedures are coordinated with the local responding agencies. \n\nRegulated substances \n\nCalleguas Municipal Water District uses and stores only one federally regulated substance, Chlorine gas, requiring the development of this Risk Management Plan.  The maximum quantity capable of being stored on site is 40,000 lbs.  However, the maximum quantity normally stored on site seldom exceeds 30,000 lbs.   The chlorine gas is stored and used directly from Department of Transportation certified one (1)-ton cylinders.\n\nCalleguas Municipal Water District also uses and stores 19% Aqueous Ammonia (Ammonium Hydroxide).  Aqueous Ammonia is regulated by the State of California at quantities greater than 500 gallons and requires the development of a California Accidental Release Plan (California equivalent to the Federal Risk Management Plan).  The maximum quantity capable of being stored on site is 9,800 gallons.  However, the maximum quantity normally stored on site s"

The Aqueous Ammonia is delivered to the site in certified chemical delivery trucks and is injected into the water directly from the storage tanks.\n\nAdministrative control and mitigation measures\n\nCalleguas Staff, in conjunction with design engineers have developed a series of operational, and maintenance checklists and procedures.  These procedures ensure the proper operation of the disinfection system.  In addition, these procedures ensure that the equipment is calibrated, inspected and maintained at the top of safe operational efficiency.\n\nThe system is designed to prevent the release of chlorine and ammonia by including layers of safety.  The chlorine is stored in a concrete block building, located away from and remotely monitored by the 24-hour operations center.  The chlorine storage building has automated valves that will close if a chlorine leak is detected.  The building has a scrubber incorporated into the design of the building. The scrubber is designed to absorb and neutralize approximately 3000 lbs. of chlorine gas (1.5 full cylinders).   Distribution of the chlorine gas is contained completely within the scrubber protected building.  Chlorine gas is mixed with water to form a 200-ppm solution that disinfects the water prior to distribution to the communities.  The disinfection solution is transported through buried double walled pipes designed to contain and report any leaks to the Operations Personnel.\n\nThe ammonia portion of the disinfection system includes the storage tanks for the aqueous ammonia and the pumps and piping used to transport and inject the ammonia solution into the chlorinated water.  The aqueous ammonia tanks are located close to the injection point.  The storage location provides secondary containment for the aqueous ammonia.  The piping connecting the stored aqueous ammonia to the injection point is double walled and drains into the secondary containment area.  This prevents a break in the delivery pip"

All information concerning chlorine and ammonia and the detailed engineering design information has been consolidated and is available.  An independent engineering consultant has completed the process hazard analysis.     \n\n5-year accident history\n\nSince 1964, Calleguas has used chlorine gas as a disinfectant for the water treatment process. In 1995, Calleguas began using aqueous ammonia to create the chloramines used in the distribution system.  Calleguas has never had an accident having offsite consequences.  This facility has not had any near misses or releases since it was built.\n\nEmergency response program \n\nCalleguas has a very active Emergency Response Program, actively participates with the local Hazardous Materials Response Teams to prepare for emergencies at the facilities and provides resources for emergency response throughout the county.  The members of the Ventura County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Team provide emergency training for Calleguas employees.  Together with the local emergency responders, Calleguas has had full-scale exercises at their facilities to prepare and familiarize the planned responding units with the facility.  These exercises have resulted in the emergency response groups having planned and prepared for an incident at either facility."
