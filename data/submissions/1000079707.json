Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Isla Blanca  Wastewater Treatment Plant are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Wastewater Treatment Facility.  We have two (2) regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide.  Chlorine is used for disinfection and sulfur dioxide for dechlorination.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 6000.00 lb., and for Sulfur Dioxide is 4000 lb.. \n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with TCEQ  Chapter 317 - Design Criteria for Sewerage Systems.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nIsla Blanca  Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Isla Blanca  Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of o"
