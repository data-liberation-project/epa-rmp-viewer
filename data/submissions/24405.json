The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe worst case scenario involves failure of the storage tank containing 58,000 pounds of ammonia.  Using the weather conditions specified by USEPA (10 minute release, Class F stability, 25 degrees C, 1.5 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the ammonia could travel 3.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are: one school (Garyville Mt. Airy Math and Science Magnet School); the communities of Garyville, Mt. Airy and Wallace (total affected population - 3,100); and several industrial facilities (degussa, Marathon - Ashland, LaRoche, Kaiser, CII, and Pinnacle Polymers).  No active mitigation measures are allowed to be considered under this scenario. \n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\n\nThe alternative case scenario involves failure of an unloading hose releasing 500 pounds of ammonia.  Using typical weather conditions specified by USEPA ( Class D stability, 25 degrees C, 3.0 meters per second wind), the OCA Guidance estimates that the ammonia could travel 0.3 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Within the potentially affected area are portions of the community of Mt. Airy (total affected population - 20) and one industrial facility (degussa).
