This size of leak would be quickly detected by the plant operations personnel due to the automatic chlorine detection system. Also, any leaking valve packing, flange leak, or valve leak would, most likely, not leak at a rate greater than the 1/4-inch hole being modeled. The EPA document, Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, gives a release rate for liquid chlorine through a 1/4-inch hole to be 150 lb./minute (Exhibit 4-13). It is estimated the release will continue for a maximum of 30 minutes before the cylinder and its companion cylinder are empty (4,000 lbs if both cylinders completely full). The total amount leaked is 4,000 lb however a 4,500 lb chlorine release is modeled to account for the possibility of the cylinders being slightly overfilled.\n\nThe WRF chlorine building is designed to contain and treat chlorine releases to meet the 1988 Uniform Fire Code, Article 80 requirements for containment and scrubbing. The chlorine scrubber is assumed to operated per design capabilities for this release. Discharge from the scrubber is 0.0027 lb/min Cl at a concentration of 15 ppm. \n\nThe City has selected to use these weather conditions for the alternate release scenario.

      "SummaryText": "1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n1.1 Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAt the City of Casa Grande, protecting the environment is a high priority. Accident prevention is the preferred alternative. When a release occurs, we are committed to responding with the maximum of city resources and cooperate with local emergency response agencies. We will provide training and information, as requested, to local emergency response agencies. All management levels support complete compliance for all safety and environmental laws and are committed to implement a RMP plan and achieve plan goals. We encourage and require employee participation in chemical safety.\n\n1.2 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe City of Casa Grande uses chlorine at its Water Reclamation Facility (WRF) located at 1194 W. Kortsen Rd. Casa Grande, Arizona. The chlorine is received as a liquid in one ton cylinders by truck. Up to four cylinders can be connected to the system at any one time. This amount (8,000 lb.) is above the 2,500 lb. regulatory threshold for chlorine. All processes that use the chlorine are classified as regulated process for purposes of the RMP rule. For the City, only the chlorination process uses chlorine and is therefor regulated for RMP purposes. All other processes at WRF do not use or have regulated chemicals above the regulatory thresholds.\n\nThe chlorine is used for disinfection of the plant effluent. Chlorine gas is dissolved in water using conventional vacuum operated chlorinators. The WRF has three chlorinators fed by one set of two cylinders. The two cylinders feed the chlorine gas as controlled by a vacuum regulator. Vacuum must be present for chlorine to be withdrawn from the cylinder set. The vacuum is provided by process water flowing through ejectors. A second backup set of two cylinders is connected to the system. When the automatic control system detects the first set of cylinders are empty the control system automatically switches to t"

      "SummaryText": "he second set of cylinders. \n\nThe chlorine solution produced is in the form of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypochlorite ions (OCl). These compounds are unregulated for RMP purposes.\n\nThe chlorine is stored and dispensed in a building especially designed to handle the chlorine. It is equipped with chlorine detectors that automatically alarm to the central control system if more than 10 ppm of chlorine is detected. In addition, the chlorine building is equipped with an automatic chlorine scrubber that is automatically or manually activated. The scrubber is designed to treat 4,800 lbs of chlorine before needing to be chemically refilled.\n\nThe automatic control system will notify the WRF operator on call during unattended hours of operation.\n\n1.3 Worst Case Scenario\n\nEssentially, the EPA requires all processes to assume that the maximum quantity of the listed chemical is released in 10 minutes. They do no allow credit for any active controls for mitigation of the release rates (i.e. automatic shutdown controls). For this facility, the worst case release quantity is 8,000 lbs. This value is the maximum quantity contained in four 1-ton cylinders full of chlorine as received from the City's suppliers. For a 10-minute release period, the yields a release rate of 800 lb./minute of chlorine. EPA default conditions were used.\n\nUsing specific guidance for liquid chlorine is found in the EPA document, Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the distance to the toxic endpoint (3-ppm) for a release of this amount is 2.7 miles. Within this distance, the City of Casa Grande has identified numerous public receptors, and no environmental receptors. The program, Landview III, estimates the population within the affected area. For this worst case scenario, there are an estimated 176 residents within the 2.7-mile radius.\n1.4 Alternate Scenario\n\nFor This facility, the alternative scenario is a liquid chlorine leak from a cylinder valve.
