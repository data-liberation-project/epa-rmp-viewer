      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW\n\nAir Liquide Large Industries, L.P. (Air Liquide) operates a steam methane reforming (SMR) process in Corpus Christi, Texas (the SMR is considered the \"covered process\", as defined in the accidental release prevention regulations, having a \"flammable mixture\" in the process in excess of 10,000 pounds). The SMR process involves reforming natural gas feedstock into hydrogen. The hydrogen purification process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.\n\n\n\nRegulated Chemical\n\nThe SMR process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using natural gas feedstock. Purified hydrogen is sold to Industrial customer(s). The Corpus Christi Hydrogen Plant also produces steam, sold directly to nearby industrial customers. The Corpus Christi SMR is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nAir Liquide's Corpus Christi SMR is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard. The flammability of some of the chemicals in the process makes it necessary for Air Liquide to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community. Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses some of the management systems in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite electronically that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all ke"

The covered process underwent an initial process hazard analysis (PHA) in September 2009 and will continue to undergo periodic review/re-validations at least every five years. The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards. The PHA team will review findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Air Liquide action item tracking system.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nAir Liquide maintains written procedures that address various modes of hydrogen purification process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action. These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAir Liquide has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the hydrogen purification process. All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topics as: general orientation, site rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response. In addition, all operators are required to attend refresher training at least every three years. Training is documented and tracked in the electronic learning management system.\n\n \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nAir Liquide has established mechanical integrity (Ml) practices and procedures, based "

The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests; (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nThe Ml program assists with the verification and suitability of new and existing process equipment and, as well as quality control of spare parts and modifications to existing process equipment.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nAir Liquide's management of change (MOC) procedure has established the requirements for ensuring that proposed process or equipment changes or changes indirectly affecting processes are evaluated, approved, and documented prior to implementation through the use of a management of change process. The MOC procedure outlines the requirements for documenting, evaluating the impact, and approving planned changes All MOC's are submitted, reviewed by subjective matter specialists (such as Engineering, Risk Management, Operations, Health and Safety), approved, tracked, and closed. Personnel whose assigned job functions are impacted by the MOC, are briefed and /or trained in the MOC requirements.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nAir Liquide ensures the safety of new/modified facilities or processes before placing those facilities or processes into service through the use of pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs). PSSRs are intended to ensure safety through confirmation that: (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications; (2) safety, operating, maintenance and emergency procedures are in place and adequate; (3) PHAs have been performed and recommendations resolved before startup of new plants o"

Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years. Resolutions to the recommendations are documented, tracked and closed.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nAir Liquide defines management systems and establishes the requirements for communicating, investigating and reporting of incidents at all facilities through the use of an Incident Investigation and reporting procedure. Air Liquide documents incident and subsequent investigation, follow up actions, and closure. Results of findings and corrective actions are shared with employees who could be affected by the findings.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nAt the Corpus Christi SMR, employees are expected to participate in an accidental release prevention program (PSM/RMP). Employees are trained on and are provided access to the hydrogen process safety information. The specific ways an employee can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in the Employee Participation plan. Forms of participation include being part of a PHA, a PSSR, and/or being involved in incident investigation. participating in the review of the covered process operating procedures annually to ensure they are correct and recommend any necessary changes.\n\n\n\nSafe & Hot Work Permit System\n\nAir Liquide has a safe & hot work permit system in place to help ensure worker and process safety. This system comprises a group of corporate procedures and standards under the life safety program. Procedures in place include: energy control, safe work, hot work, confined space entry and process line break. Facility personnel are trained on these safe work practices to"

Contractors are made aware of the potential dangers involved with a system covered by PSM/RMP. Procedures are in place to make sure that contractors: (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, and (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency prior to their beginning work. Periodically contractors are evaluated to ensure that both their safety performance and training required for work on the hydrogen purification process.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nAir Liquide's accidental release prevention program activities helps prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors. The following are examples of the types of safety features in place:\n\n?         Personal/portable ambient air monitors\n\n?         Release Mitigation\n\n?         PSV's\n\n?

In 2011 the site completed a substantial redesign of the reformer subheader assembly in response to previous mechanical integrity issues. In 2015 the site replaced the reformer transfer lines with an upgraded metallurgy in response to previously mechanical integrity concerns. In 2021 Air Liquide will improve its PSA valve reliability program to replace control valves on a more frequent basis to minimize premature process shutdowns. And in 2021 the Corpus Christi SMR will upgrade its Advanced Process Controls (APC) system to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of the plant.\n\n"
