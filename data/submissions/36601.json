(KPL), is committed to managing all operations in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of employees, customers, contractors and the public while fully complying with applicable laws and regulations.  KPL?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.  \n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) is to provide information about operations at the terminal, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event an accidental release should occur, the five-year accident history of the terminal, and planned changes to improve safety at the terminal.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Tulsa Truck Terminal is owned by Koch Hydrocarbon, LP and operated by KPL.  At the terminal, propane is received via pipeline.  It is then dehydrated and stored in pressure vessels.  From these pressure vessels, propane is loaded into tanker trucks for distribution.  Propane is the only flammable substance regulated under the Risk Management Program (RMP) that is present at the Tulsa Truck Terminal in amounts above threshold quantity.  Ethyl mercaptan is stored at the terminal, however, the amount stored is below threshold quantity.  The terminal is classified as Program Level 3 under the regulation.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the terminal are part of the high standards striven for by KPL.  These high standards include:\n\nOperating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations.\nOperati"

Ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of the process, detailed training of employees, and emphasis on safety has helped avoid any serious chemical release accidents over the last 5 years.  Part of this program has also involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this terminal include:\n\n?Emergency shutdown devices at four locations within the terminal in order to shutdown the entire terminal during emergency situations.\n?Emergency shutdown capabilities at the central control room in Wichita in order to shutdown the entire terminal during emergency situations.\n?Level alarms on storage tanks and bullets to help prevent overfilling.\n?A hydrocarbon gas detection system consisting of 8 gas detectors located throughout the terminal.  The hydrocarbon gas detection system will sound an alarm at low gas concentrations and will trigger the emergency shutdown system at high gas concentrations.\n?A fire detection system consisting of four fire-eyes, which will trigger the emergency shutdown system when activated.\n?Motion detectors at main load pumps, the office, and regeneration skid will ESD the terminal.\n?Excess flow valves on the inlet lines and outlet lines for each storage tank to shut-off the tank during large release situations.\n?Reverse check valves on each storage tank liquid outlet line, which can be activated by fusible links, hitting the emergency shutdown button or"

Also involved in emergency response for the terminal would be the Tulsa City Fire Department and Police Department, Tulsa County LEPC, and as appropriate, the Tulsa Ambulance Service, St. John?s Hospital, St. Francis Hospital, Hillcrest Hospital, and the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol.  The Terminal Operations Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the terminal is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials, along with evacuation procedures, regular drilling, and training.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program coupled with the Environmental Health and Safety Management Systems, forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\n?The Management of Change provisions ensure that the potential safety and health impacts of any change made to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures are considered.\n?The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions "

The terminal coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis."
