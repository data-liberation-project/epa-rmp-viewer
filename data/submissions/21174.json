Many of our employees are members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, area volunteer fire departments, and local emergency response units.  Our facilities have written emergency preparedness plans that are updated regularly.  \n\nAshland facilities typically host open houses every 3 to 5 years as an opportunity for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Ashland makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substances handled:  \n\nFor more information, visit our web site at www.ashspec.com or contact the Plant Manager.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe USEPA RMP regulations require the worst-case release scenario to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released.  This event is unlikely and has never occurred at our facility.  Based on our analysis using USEPA-approved methods, the worst-case release scenario could potentially affect offsite receptors.  There were no specific administrative controls or mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.\n\nThe alternative-case release scenario:\n"

The alternative-case release scenario represents an accidental release that is more reasonable than the worst-case, but is still highly unlikely to occur.

There were no specific administrative controls or mitigation measures considered in the analysis to limit the distance reported.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \n\nThis facility is operated in strict accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures.  Our management system procedures ensure rigorous training for operations employees, numerous management checks and balances, and strict attention to changes in the operations with a thorough review and examination of potential incidents that could lead to accidental releases.  Ashland maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can speedily coordinate emergency response with management and quickly communicate key first-aid or medical information to local health care providers.  This facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available for use in an emergency.  \n\nFive-year accident history. \n\nWe have never had a release of cyclohexylamine that has had any offsite impacts from our facility.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n \nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond to accidental chemical releases.  Our employees regularly undergo training in emergency response actions and methods.  Our facilities regularly invite local fire departments and emergency responders to tour and inspect our plants, gain familiarity with our operations, and participate in joint emergency drills.
