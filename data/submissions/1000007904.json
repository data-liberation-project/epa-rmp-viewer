This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as employee training and in considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility. This location implements both administrative and engineering controls to reasonably minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. The facility does not anticipate having any type of uncontrolled release.  However if an uncontrolled release does occur, the personnel at the facility in cooperation with local response agencies are trained to respond, minimize and/or eliminate any exposure that could occur to protect employees and the surrounding area.\n\n    Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nThe Dover Hennessey Plant located 2 miles south of Hennessey, Oklahoma, consists of one Program Level 3 process which utilizes several operations (e.g., separation, dehydration, compression, cryogenic) to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas liquid mixture, methane) from a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture.  This plant could contain regulated flammables (e.g., mixtures containing methane, ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane, pentane, and iso-pentane), but no regulated toxic inventories, in excess of the threshold quantities established in the regulation.  All transportation of regulated flammables into and out of the facility is handled via pipelines and trucking.\n\n    Hazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenario\nThe Worst Case Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of an NGL storage tank releasing the entire contents instantaneously to the atmosphere; having an offsite impact.

In addition qualified individuals operate this facility daily; the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventive maintenance schedule further reducing the likelihood of this occurrence.\n\n    Hazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenario\nThe Alternative Release Scenario for this facility is for flammables and would be a failure of a loading line on the truck loading rack, thus releasing 600 gallons (3500 lbs) of the contents of the NGL storage tank to the atmosphere in a 10-minute period.  The result of the release would have an offsite impact.  EPA's RMP comp model was used to calculate this release scenario.  Qualified individuals operate this facility daily, the equipment is inspected and maintained according to a preventative maintenance schedule, which further reduces the likelihood of this release occurring.\n\n    Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThis facility is regulated by 29CFR 1910.119 (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals),   1910.38 (Employee Emergency Plans), 1910.120 (Hazardous Waste and Emergency Response), 40CFR 112 (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure), RCRA and State and Federal EPCRA Rules/Laws, as well as other federal, state and local regulations which are all developed to reduce the potential for the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.This facility has implemented the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals along with additional requirements of the Risk Management Program as the Accident Release Prevention Program.  There are other practices and measures, which are contained in numerous plans and procedures that all assist to prevent the release of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  Facility accident prevention programs promote the pro-active identification, evaluation, and mitigation or prevention of releases of highly hazardous substances that could occur as a result of fa"

The implementation of The Employee Participation Program requires the development of the necessary expertise, experiences, judgement, and proactive initiative within the workforce.An established comprehensive training program has been developed and implemented at the facility.  All employees are trained in an overview of the process as well as in appropriate safe work practices per the corporate safety guidelines.  In addition to the training required of all employees, personnel having responsibilities under the operating and maintenance procedures are trained in those procedures.Safe work practices have been developed to ensure safe operations that are consistent with industry practice and meet regulatory requirements.  Safe work practices include site control, lockout/tagout, line breaking, confined space entry and hot work to ensure the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.This facility has a policy of investigating every incident, which may have possibly resulted in a release to prevent a similar accident from recurring. The Company has established an audit procedure to assure the continued integrity of the prevention program, ensuring the safety and well being of employees and the surrounding area.\n\n    5 Year Accident History\nThe Dover Hennessey Plant has had an excellent accident prevention program over the last five- (5) years.  There have been no releases of listed Hazardous Substances which resulted in offsite effects.\n\n    Emergency Response Program\nThe Dover Hennessey Plant maintains a written emergency response plan to protect workers, ensure public safety and to protect the environment.
