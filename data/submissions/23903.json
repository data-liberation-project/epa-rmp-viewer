If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Thornton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nThis facility is a retail business delivering from one 30,000 gallon tank.\n\nOur worst-case scenario if failure on one 30,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed, resulting in a  toxic gas release.  According to EPA's look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 6.9 miles.  There are private homes, business, and a school within the distance to the endpoint, with a total population of 2523 people.  Our alternative scenario  if failure on one 30,000 gallon storage tank  when a riser hose breaks is to evacuate a 6.7 mile radius.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident preventaion rule and all applicablew state and local codes and regulations.  The Anhydrous system is designed, installed and maintained in accordance with  all state laws.\n\nWe have never had an accident  involving anhydrous that caused death, property or enviromental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous system, it is our policy to notify the Thornton Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  we have given them a site map and emergency telehone numbers through Tier II.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety is none at this time."
