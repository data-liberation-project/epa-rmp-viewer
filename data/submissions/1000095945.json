ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\nThis will serve as the Executive Summary of the policies, procedures and activities for compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, 40 CFR 68.79, for Breitburn Operating, L.P.'s Sherman 35 Gas Plant. Breitburn Operating, L.P. and the Sherman 35 Gas Plant are committed to protecting the health and safety of company personnel, contractors, visitors, and the surrounding community and the environment. This commitment is strongly supported by senior management and is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training, design safety, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. Breitburn understands that strong health, safety, and environmental principles, properly integrated into our management processes, and day to day practices greatly contributes to our business success.\r\n\r\nII. FACILITY DETAILS AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HELD\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant is located at 140th Avenue, Tustin Michigan in Osceola County. The Sherman 35 Plant operates as an unmanned facility. The primary function of the Sherman 35 Plant encompasses natural gas liquids (NGLs) extraction, with local sales of NGL from a pressurized storage tank. The plant has a regulated flammable mixture, comprised of ethane, propane, butanes, and pentanes. There are no threshold quantities of 112(r) regulated toxic substances at the facility. The Sherman 35 Plant is a Program Level 2 facility, and is not subject to Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations.\r\n\r\nIII. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nBecause the Sherman 35 Plant is subject to Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Manageme"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n  \r\n i. Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals at the plant, process technology, and process equipment, including equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response, as well as exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS's) located on site at the facility. The facility also maintains numerous technical documents including information such as materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical ratings of equipment. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. \r\n\r\n   ii. Hazard Review\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic hazard reviews will be conducted at least every 5 years.\r\n\r\n   iii. Operating Procedures\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant maintains written operating procedures that address various modes of process oper"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed for accuracy. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made.\r\n\r\n   iv. Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Sherman 35 Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in plant operations and the facility operating procedures. All operators periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is required to be conducted every three years. \r\n\r\n   v. Maintenance\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant has well-established practices and procedures to maintain facility process equipment in a safe, operating condition. The basic aspects of the Maintenance Program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process. Inspection and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.\r\n\r\n   vi. Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Sherman 35 Plant periodically conducts a compliance audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are required to be conducted at least every 3 years.\r\n\r\n   vii. Incident Investigatio"

      "SummaryText": "n\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could have resulted in: a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personnel injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident or similar incident. \r\n\r\nb. CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe processes at the Sherman 35 Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The Sherman 35 Plant has safety features in many areas to quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The Sherman 35 Plant uses release detection systems such as hydrocarbon detectors and alarms, and release mitigation measures such as process relief valves, automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters and diking and containment to contain liquid releases.\r\n\r\nIV. FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant has an excellent record of accident prevention. No incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at the facility within the last five years. Since plant startup, there has not been a release of any regulated substance.\r\n\r\nV. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe Sherman 35 Plant has an emergency response plan that has been coordinated with local emergency response personnel. \r\n\r\nVI. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nAll findings from the Hazard Review performed on April 22, 2014 have been resolved. All findings from the most recent Compliance Audit performed on September 13, 2013 have also been resolved. The Sherman 35 Plant will continue to conduct hazard reviews, safety audits, incident investigations as applicable, and other prevention program elements to continuously improve personnel and public safety."
