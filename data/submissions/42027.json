The Marianna Corporation facility in Memphis, Tennessee is subject to this rule due to the storage of Isobutane and N-Butane above the threshold quantity listed in the regulations.\n\nThe person in charge of the RMP program at this location is Mr. Garrie Kane.\n\nThe address for this facility is as follows:\nMarianna of Memphis, Inc.\n1178 Pope Street, Building #2\nMemphis, Tennessee 38108-2535\n\nThe facility is designed to fill, receive, store and distribute finished products of aerosol canisters.\n\nThe worst case scenario for the facility is the ignition of the largest storage vessel that contains a covered flammable material.  The largest vessel is an 18,000-gallon above ground storage tank located at the north side of the facility.  With a maximum filling capacity of eighty eight percent (88%) this accounts for 15,840 gallons of product.  The contents of this tank are 48% isobutane and 52% 1,1 Difluoroethane.  With a density of 5.84 pounds per gallon, this represents 92,529 pounds of the worst case substance, isobutane.  Using the USEPA RMP*Comp software version 1.07, the impact of up to 1 PSI results in a radius of 0.40 miles.\n\nThe alternate scenario for the facility is a fire in the warehouse section of the property.  Actual data from a fire in this building was obtained from the previous tenant and was used to present this alternate scenario.  The fire in the warehouse resulted in the burning of six (6) pallets of aerosol cans.  The quantity released was approximately 4,018 pounds.  The impact from this fire was limited to the interior of the building or a 0.06 mile radius.  There are no affected public receptors or environmental receptors within this radius.  Fire walls and blast walls were included as passive mitigation systems.  Active mitigation included the automatic sprinkler system.  \n\nMarianna of Memphis, Inc. is also covered"
