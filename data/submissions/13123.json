ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Steuben Foods recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\n     The Steuben Foods PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and  integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its safety program.  The PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the fileing date has passed.\n\n     Steuben Foods believes that Employee participation is the key to a successful program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Project Manager and the Refrigeration System Operators, have been deeplly involved and they assume the major responsibility for operating the Elma, New York facility safely.\n\n     The Steuben Foods Emergency Response Program has been developed with the complete cooperation and support of the Elma Fire Department.  All Steuben Foods employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Steuben Foods is a Manufacturer of Aseptic dairy products.\n     The refrigeration system contains no more than 25,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia. \n      Anhydrous Ammonia is the only Hazardous Material on site in quantities above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nIII.  SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\n     The WORST CASE release scenario involves the complete rupture of the High Pressure Receive.\n     A maximum of 11185 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period was considered.\n     Under worst case weather conditions ammonia could travel up to .9 miles before dispersing.\n\n     A WORST CASE relea"

DESCRIPTION OF THE STEUBEN FOODS ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     Steuben Foods conducts an annual training and response exercise with the Elma Fire Department to practice, train and update the Emergency Response Program.\n\n     Steuben Foods conducts an annual PSM/RMP implementation progress audit of the entire PSM/RMP prograr to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements.  Steuben Foods considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability.\n\n     Steuben Foods emphasizes and insists on  employee participation from the refrigeration system operators in all aspects of the developent, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n     Steuben Foods provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program with one-on-one teacher involvement in specific training modules for each ammonia refrigeration employee.\n\n     Steuben Foods maintains a pro-active open-door policy toward neighbors"

FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia at Steuben Foods that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI.  Emergency Response Program\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia release.  The site emergency plan has been coordinated with the community emergency plan under the jurisdiction of the Local Elma Fire Department.\n\nVII.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      Steuben Foods recognizes that (even though their Ammonia release and injury experience has been excellent) their PSM/RMP program will provide much needed improvement to their safety effort. The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of living documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before Safety becomes becomes second nature.\n\n     Steuben Foods expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing  the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program\n\n          (1)   Employee Participation is the Key to a successful program.  Bothof the Refrigeration System Operators are deeply involved in Verifying the P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n          (2)    The Steuben Foods PSM/RMP Program is:  (a) computer based,  (b)user friendly,  (c) includes one-on-one involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and   (e) written to be understood and used by the operating level employees.\n\n          (3)   All recommendations developed during the HAZOP were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia Refrigeration Process.
