As part of this commitment, Entergy has established systems to ensure safe operation of the facility.  One part of this system is the Risk Management Program that complies with the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements.  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP) describing the risk management program at Entergy's Lewis Creek plant.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP requirements and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Entergy's Lewis Creek plant near Willis, Texas.\n\n\n\nThe Entergy Lewis Creek Plant is a fossil-fueled steam, electric generating facility burning natural gas.  The Lewis Creek Plant consists of two generating units with a combined capacity of 530,000 kilowatts.  Unit 1 initial operation was November 3, 1970 at 4:15 p.m., and Unit 2 initial operation was March 24, 1971 at 6:35 p.m.  Units 1 and 2 were designed to use natural gas as the primary fuel with No. 2 fuel oil as a standby, which is not in use any longer.  The Lewis Creek Plant Standard Industry Classification (SIC) code is 4911.\n\n\n\nThe plant is located in Montgomery County, two miles west of Willis, Texas.  From Interstate 45-North, take Longstreet Exit (No. 95).  Turn left on Longstreet Road and travel two miles to the Lewis Creek Plant and enter through the main gate.  The area is rural with open pastures, rolling hills and forest areas.  Within 5 miles of the plant there are small subdivisions located on Lake Conroe and residential areas in the western side of Willis.  Immediately next to the plant is a reservoir that belongs to Entergy and has restrictions on public access.  \n\n\n\nClean "

      "SummaryText": "Energy's Pickens Plant, a liquefied natural gas facility, is located adjacent to and due north of the plant.  The power plant and the LNG facility are the only industrial facilities in the immediate area.  \n\n\n\nThe burning of fuels such as natural gas or fuel oil causes the emission of nitrogen oxides.  Nitrogen oxide emissions from many sources combine with hydrocarbons in the air to form ozone.  The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has determined that by reducing the emission of nitrogen oxides in the Houston area, there will be a reduction in the ozone levels.  The TCEQ has required Entergy to install pollution controls at the Lewis Creek Plant.  Based on this requirement, Entergy has installed equipment called Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units that are used to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions from the Lewis Creek plant's two boilers.  \n\n\n\nSince, the SCR process uses anhydrous ammonia, the Lewis Creek plant is subject to the federal Risk Management Program.  The Risk Management program is designed to promote safe operation of industrial processes.  The program is intended to protect the public and the environment.  Entergy is committed to protecting the safety of the public and its employees.  \n\n\n\nEntergy will have as a priority the safe use of ammonia at the plant.

      "SummaryText": "mentation and system upgrades which will achieve compliance with these policies.  \n\n\n\nWhy ammonia is considered a toxic chemical?\n\nAnhydrous ammonia (pure, undiluted ammonia) used for industrial purposes is a very powerful chemical compared to the diluted ammonia found in household cleaning products.  Ammonia is only dangerous to the public if it is released to the air, and even then it would have to be released in a large enough quantity to drift beyond the property line of the Lewis Creek Plant.  It is important to realize that the likelihood of a release of anhydrous ammonia is very slim and the release of quantities large enough to cause long-term health effects is very unlikely.  Well-trained personnel using safe operating procedures at the Lewis Creek Plant will assure safe handling of the anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory Programs\n\nThe Lewis Creek plant is subject to regulation by federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Risk Management Program and by the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA).  Both of these agencies regulate the SCR process installed at the Lewis Creek Plant.  Entergy has designed the SCR process to have built-in safety features such as automatic shutoffs, flow controls, ammonia detectors, and other equipment that is designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  The personnel who operate the process are trained in proper operation and how to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  Entergy will implement the procedures outlined in its Risk Management Plan (RMP) to assure that the public and the environment are protected.  \n\n\n\nEntergy has developed this Risk Management Plan to reduce the potential of accidental releases of ammonia by performing a hazard assessment, developing a prevention program, and conducting emergency response planning\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response\n\nEntergy implements reasonable controls to prevent unforeseeable releases of hazardous substances"

Each situation is evaluated individually and appropriate measures are taken to protect the employees and the community. Entergy, first responders, and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) have established a program to warn the community if an accident occurs that could threaten the community.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substances\n\nEntergy handles several substances regulated by the RMP rule but ammonia is the only one present in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule.  The information below indicates the process as defined by the rule and the regulated substance.\n\n\n\nRegulated Process:  This covered process consists of a storage tank containing a maximum of 150,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The liquefied ammonia is loaded into this tank from a tank truck/rail car.  This tank is supplied with redundant relief valves.  This operation is monitored by an unloading technician.  This ammonia is then transferred from the storage tank to the Selective Catalytic Reduction units on each boiler.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History \n\nThe five-year accident history includes all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or in deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage off site.  There have been no recordable accidental releases at the Lewis Creek Plant associated with the use of ammonia or any other chemical subject to the EPA Risk Management Program.  \n\n\n\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\n\nEntergy performed an offsite consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of ammonia to affect the public or the environment.  The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios and alternative release scenarios. Entergy does not expect the events that would cause a worst case scenario to eve"
