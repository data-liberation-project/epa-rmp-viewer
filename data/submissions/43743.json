The quantity of Cl2 maintained on-site for this purpose exceeds the threshold limit as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 40 CFR, Part 68, under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act. \n\nThe City of Sand Springs and its facilities are devoted to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  This is evident by the established training procedures utilized by the City personnel\n\nThe SSWTP supplies drinking water to both Sand Springs residents and rural water districts.  The treatment process is designed for a production capacity of 10 mgd.  Chlorine is used to inactivate pathogenic organisms in the treated water before distribution and to maintain a chlorine residual within the distribution system to protect the water quality.  The chlorine supply is pulled into the process from one-ton containers under a vacuum.  The presence of the vacuum prevents gas from escaping into the atmosphere in case of potential failure downstream of the vacuum regulator.  This vacuum feed begins at the regulators, which are mounted directly to the ton containers, eliminating gaseous pressure piping in the system.  The gas is then mixed into a water solution and fed into the treatment. \n\nThe chlorine system components at the plant comply with applicable local, state and federal standards.  In addition, consistent maintenance and regular training sessions will minimize the potential for a toxic release.\n\nThe SSWTP has not had any accidental chemical releases within the last five years.  If a release were to occur, then the chlorine gas detectors would notify plant by sounding an alarm.  For a small leak with no potential safety or health hazard, plant personnel would stop the leak using personal protective equipment (PPE"

      "SummaryText": ").  If unable to stop the leak or if the leak is substantial posing health or safety hazard, then City personnel would contact local fire, Brentag, police and other city staff respectively.  Other regulatory agencies would be contacted as required.  The Emergency Planning and Response Team work with plant personnel to minimize the impact of the release by training and initiating drills to verify preparedness as drilled in accordance with the county emergency response procedure manual.  \n\nOriginal RMP was submitted September 2000.  First 5-year RMP update submitted August 2005.Second five year RMP update submitted May 21, 2010.\n"
