      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention\nBodycote Thermal Processing's overall intent is to minimize, where possible, the storage and use of highly hazardous chemicals in our heat treating facilities.  When highly hazardous chemicals are required to properly perform our heat treat processes, facility management is expected to ensure the safety of Bodycote associates and protection of the environment.  All managers must comply with Bodycote's Policy on Environmental issues.\n\nFacility and Substances Handled\n\nBodycote Thermal Processing operates a 15,000 square foot plant that provides heat-treating services to the metal working markets throughout upstate New York.  The facility uses ammonia in gaseous form along with hydrocarbon gases to create a hard, wear resistant surface on steel parts.  Processes that require the use of ammonia are carboniting and nitrocarboniting.  Both of these processes are common to the heat treating industry.  Ammonia is used to supply nitrogen in a form readily absorbed by steel surfaces.  Commercially available nitrogen cannot be readily absorbed by steel and therefore is not a less hazardous substitute.\n\nThe ammonia is stored in a 9,200-gallon steel tank as a gas liquified by pressure.  The tank was installed in 1976.  The tank and all associated piping were repainted in August 2001.  Secondary containment was provided for the tank and product transfer area in July 2001.  A low line pressure alarm was installed in July 2001.  The tank and associated piping is on a 5-year inspection program, the most recent inspection being November 2004.  Vaporized ammonia is drawn off the tank and delivereed to the heat treat process via a piping system.  A qualified vendor fills the ammonia tank approximately once every 3 months.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility maintains compliance with OSHA standard 1910.119, \"Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals\".  Also, the supplier of the chemical, LaRoche Industries, has supplied "

      "SummaryText": "the facility with recommended practices for the storage and handling of ammonia.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has never had a reportable release accident.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, facility personnel will activate a bell sound indicating an ammonia release.  Personnel are expected to evacuate the facility and meet at a designated area outside the facility.  The plant manager or shift supervisor willl either contact 911 or pull the fire alarm linked through the securiy system that dials 911 automatically.  Training and a practice drill are performed once per year.  The General Manager coordinates all public notifications.  The facility is included in the Monroe County LEPC \"Hazardous Materials Response Plan\".  This plan includes additional support to the facility in the event of an ammonia release.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the most recent Process Hazard Analysis conducted on June 23, 2004, changes to the current facility safety program are not necessary."
