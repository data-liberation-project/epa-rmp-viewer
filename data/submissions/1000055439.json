If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Alhambra Fire Department, Madison County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2.  The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\r\n\r\n     The primary activity at the facility, which is located at 401 Elm Street, Alhambra, IL  is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and handling system consists of 1-26,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, associated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\r\n\r\n     The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 336,000 pounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse tanks.\r\n\r\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\n     This facility has developed a worst-case and alternative-case scenario, however, since this is security-sensitive information it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as required by EPA regulations.\r\n\r\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\n     This facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility has implementd the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safet"

Five year accident history.\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\r\n-    have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\r\n-    to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n6.  The emergency response program.\r\n\r\n     The facility has:\r\n\r\n-    a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.28;\r\n-    provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\r\n\r\nIn the event of any emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the Alhambra Fire Department and County LEPC and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire department and LEPC.\r\n\r\n7.
