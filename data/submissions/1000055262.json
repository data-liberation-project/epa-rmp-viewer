Epichlorohydrin is the only RMP regulated substance stored or processed in amounts greater than threshold quantity in the Shipping/Loading area.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nHexion's constant emphasis on safety ,ongoing analysis of the potential hazards of our process, and detailed training of our employees allow us to operate safely.  Part of the Accident Prevention Program also involves identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  This is accomplished through Process Hazard Analyses and periodic review of policies and procedures.  Additionally, the site has various safety features to detect, contain and control, and mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\r\n\r\n1. Release detection\r\n\u00bf\tProcess alarms\r\n\u00bf\tOperator surveillance\r\n\u00bf\tPortable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment \r\n\u00bf\tPerimeter chlorine detection system\r\n\r\n2. Release containment and control\r\n\u00bf\tRelief systems designed to prevent equipment overpressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare)\r\n\u00bf\tDikes to contain liquid releases\r\n\u00bf\tRedundant equipment (i.e. back-up firewater pump)\r\n\u00bf\tAutomatic control valves to allow rapid isolation of the process\r\n\u00bf\tChlorine emergency containment system\r\n\r\n3.

In addition, there are procedures that address maintenance, inspection, testing, and use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific response duties.  The emergency response program is updated as needed to address changes to Resins processes.  The Management of Change process is used to trigger updates to the emergency response plan, including notification and training of personnel affected by the change.  All the above actions of the emergency response program are undertaken by Hexion through a service agreement with Shell. \r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nDiligent compliance with our RMP Prevention Program forms the framework on which we will continue to improve the level of safety at the facility.  Some of the key components of the safety improvements we expect to achieve are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The Management of Change provisions ensure that we consider the potential safety and health impacts of any change we make to process chemicals, technology, equipment or procedures.\r\n\r\n2. The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure continual evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in our safety standards.\r\n\r\n3. The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of our safety program.\r\n\r\n4. Internal and third party compliance audits will ensure we maintain and increase our level of safety protection.\r\n\r\n5.
