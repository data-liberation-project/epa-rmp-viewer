Refrigeration is required for controlling air temperature in storage areas. Refrigeration is provided through evaporation of liquid anhydrous ammonia by a heat source.  The evaporated ammonia gas is contained in a closed loop system where it is mechanically compressed back into a liquid state for re-use.  Liquid ammonia is moved by system pressure from storage through piping to locations where refrigeration is needed. \n\n\n\nBlues City Brewery is committed to providing a safe working environment. We will achieve this mission by promoting a culture in which employee safety is paramount in each and every endeavor. We will actively promote and maintain the following beliefs in everything we do:\n\n\n\n?    Safety performance is critically important to the success of this company\n\n?    Concern for employee safety will be evident and embedded into all phases of our work by design and through the business decisions that we make. \n\n?    Each employee is empowered with responsibility for his or her personal safety and the safety of their fellow employees and stakeholders. \n\n?    Continuous improvement is a way of life at this facility; we use feedback and experience to refine and build upon our culture to ensure continual forward progress. \n\n?    Safety incidents are preventable; we will strive to ensure that our policies, practices, and decisions are proactive on all accounts.\n\n?    Management is responsible for ensuring employees have the knowledge, skills, and equipment necessary to protect themselves and others. \n\n?    We will not be satisfied to simply meet safety compliance standards. \n\n?    Every task must be performed with concern for the welfare of ourselves, fellow employees, our contractors, our visitors, and the co"

Each person within the company must understand his/her roles and responsibilities for the overall program management and for each individual program. The success of our program depends on all employees incorporating our culture into every part of our day-to-day business practice and decisions.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nBlues City continues to update the comprehensive set of operating procedures to provide instruction in the safe operation of facility processes covered by this RMP.  Procedures shall provide a reliable and consistent reference for all phases of process operations.\n\n\n\nEach procedure contains procedure steps, operating parameters and limits, safety and health hazard information, safety control measures, and assignment of responsibility for performing the procedure.  \n\n \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe brewery maintains an internal emergency action plan containing specific procedures for prompt response to emergencies that impact property and personnel onsite. \n\n\n\nPeriodic compliance audits will ensure that the plan is kept up-to-date. All employees are trained on this plan during new-hire training and receive refresher training on a routine basis.\n\n\n\nThe brewery maintains a working relationship with the City of Memphis Fire Department and the Shelby County Emergency Management Agency. These agencies are knowledgeable regarding the risks associated with the ammonia system and response procedures during an emergency. \n\n\n\nNo reportable incidents have occurred at the facility since 2014; therefore, there have been none during the last five year period.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes - Safety Improvements\n\nBlues City Brewery has no planned changes at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
