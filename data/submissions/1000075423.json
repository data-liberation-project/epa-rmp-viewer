This commitment is demonstrated by the company's efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the process. Pioneer's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within their capabilities, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nPioneer Energy (Pioneer) owns and operates a Vaporcatcher skid and a natural gas liquids (NGL) tank at the Serrahn Pad in McKenzie County, North Dakota.  The Vaporcatcher is designed to process tank vapors and recover liquid products from vapors by physical separation and cryogenic means.  The Vaporcatcher is considered a small natural gas processing plant for regulatory purposes. NGLs recovered from this process are marketed for off-site sales.\n\n\n\nThe NGL product contains methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components. The regulated flammable substances include these same components. This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nResults of the worst-case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to RMP Program Level 2 requirements.  Details are included with the backup documentation associated with this RMP plan.\n\nThere is one worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances at the Vaporcatcher at the Serrahn Pad.  The scenario consists of a vapor cloud explosion "

The WCS results in the largest impacted area with a 0.4-mile radius.\n\n\n\nThe WCS has an offsite endpoint and would affect two (2) oil and gas facilities (industrial) public receptors.  Pioneer has controls to prevent such a release and to manage consequences. Mitigation measures include relief valves, check valves, grounding equipment, and rupture disks.\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for the flammable substances at the Vaporcatcher at the Serrahn Pad is assumed to be a vapor cloud explosion resulting from the release of 78,000 pounds of NGLs from a pipe between a Vaporcatcher skid and the NGL tank. The release would occur from a break in the 1-inch pipeline that would involve 1,300 pounds per minute being released for 60 minutes before the leak was stopped. The ARS would impact a radius of 0.2 miles, which includes an offsite endpoint and a nearby industrial public receptors. \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatcher at the Serrahn Pad is not covered by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program since it can be operated remotely, and Pioneer does not keep employees at its location. This results in the process being Program Level 2. The following sections detail how Pioneer complies with the Program 2 requirements for accident prevention. \n\n\n\nA. Process Safety Information/Process Controls\n\n\n\nPioneer keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process.  These technical documents address the following:\n\n\n\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\n\n3. Maximum intended inventories\n\n4. Upper and lower limits of process equipment\n\n5. Equipment design basis and configuration information\n\n6. Identification of necessary regulatory equipment design documents\n\n7.

For specific areas within the process, Pioneer has documented safety-related limits for specific parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator's procedures manual.  The company maintains the overall process within these limits by using remote controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems. \n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings.  This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed changes to safety features to ensure these are not compromised. \n\n\n\n B. Hazard Review\n\n\n\nThe Vaporcatcher at the Serrahn Pad identifies and controls hazards associated with the RMP covered scenario.  This program systematically examines and explores for potential hazards, then establishes controls to put in place to manage the potential hazards.  The hazard review is conducted using checklists by Pioneer's employees and/or consultants who have operation, maintenance, engineering, and safety experience.  This review evaluates and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards identified.  The findings are forwarded to Pioneer for review.  The approved mitigation options in response to the hazard review findings are tracked until they are completed.

Procedures will be updated, if necessary, whenever a major change occurs and prior to startup of the changed process. \n\n\n\nCovered process Operating Procedures are readily available to operators for the process unit and to other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and ensure the covered process is operating within its safe limits.\n\n\n\nD.  Training\n\n\n\nPioneer has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the covered process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test or hands on observation specific to the plant operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.

As a non-responding facility, the RMP emergency response program and emergency response plan requirements (40 CFR 68.95) are not applicable at this facility.  However, the facility does maintain an emergency response plan that serves as guidance for facility employees to notify first responders, secure critical operations before evacuation, evacuate the facility, and account for personnel, among other items.  Facility personnel are trained in procedures and use of equipment appropriate to their role in response to small accidental releases. Pioneer will also coordinate with local planning and response organizations to ensure emergency responders are informed of the substances, quantities, and risks associated with the facility in response to a release. Pioneer will coordinate with emergency organizations at least annually, unless more frequency is needed.
