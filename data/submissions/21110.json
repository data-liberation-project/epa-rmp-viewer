If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to respond as per the procedures set forth within our Emergency Response Plans Manual for Esso Eastern Inc., Guam.  As part of the Emergency Response Plans Manual the Guam Fire Department will be immediately notified and requested that they respond to the emergency. \n\nA description of your facility and regulated substances handled.  This facility is a wholesale LPG distribution terminal.  We receive, store, and distribute LPG.  Our facility consists of two 300 metric ton storage bullets mounded together under bedding sand and encased in concrete, a bulk loading gantry, a cylinder filling shed and associated pumps, compressors, and piping.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios.  Our worst case scenario would be, during a typhoon flying debris shearing/rupturing a pipeline at a point below an isolation valve immediately above a storage bullet.  If the entire contents of one storage bullet were to be released (300 metric tons at 85% ambient) resulting in a vapor cloud explosion, the resulting endpoint distance would extend off-site and have public receptors within the endpoint distance.  Our alternative release would be a hose rupture from the two-inch diameter liquid line at the bulk-loading gantry resulting in a five-minute release and explo"

      "SummaryText": "sion. The endpoint distance from the resulting explosion would not extend off-site and there would be no public receptors.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical -specific prevention steps. Our facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable Federal and local codes and regulations.  This system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58, and all applicable laws.\n\nFive-year accident history. We have not had an accident involving LPG that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.\n\nThe emergency response program. In the event of possible emergency involving our LPG plant, it is our policy to respond as per our established Emergency Response Plans Manual.  These plans include the immediate notification of the Guam Fire Department, the Port Authority of Guam Police, and our surrounding neighbors. The Guam Fire Department will be requested to respond to the emergency.  Quarterly drills are conducted with employees and annual drills are co-ordinated and conducted with Guam Fire Department.  Our last major drill was conducted in May 1999.  \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety. There are no current changes planned for our facility.  The Emergency Response Plans Manual was updated with current facility schematics and drawings to be available for Guam Fire Department use in the event of an emergency.  This was a recommendation resulting from the May 1999 fire drill."
