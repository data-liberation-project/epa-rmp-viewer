The accidental release prevention and emergency policies at the facility:\n\nThe Na-Churs Alpine Solutions (Na-Churs) facility located at 421 Leader Street, Marion, Marion County County, Ohio complies with applicable requirements for ammonia storage, and it is Na-Churs policy to adhere to all apllicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an accidental release were to occur involving the ammonia storage system, Na-Churs would immediately notify the Marion Fire Department, who would respond to the emergency.\n\n2.  A description of the facility and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility produces plant food for commercial and private use.  The plant food product is produced by mixing several chemicals in a reactor, including ammonia.  The ammonia storage process consists of two (2) above ground storage tanks (20,000 and 23,000 gallons) and associated piping, valves, pumps, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential failure of the 23,000-gallon storage tank (largest vessel) filled to 90% of its holding capacity (administrative controls limit each ammonia storage tank to 90% capacity), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization.\n\nThe following assumptions/conditions were utilized for the worst-case scenario:\n\n- Administrative controls in place;\n- Passive mitigation (diked area) considered;\n- Spill instantaneously covers diked area; \n- Urban topography; \n- Atmospheric stability class F;\n- Wind Speed of 1.5 meters/second; and\n- Ambient air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius\n\nThe maximum area of the pool was calculated assuming a pool depth of one centimeter and Equation 3-6 of US EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis, EPA 550-B-99-009, April 1999 (Guidance) as follows:\n\nA = QS \u00d7 DF \n\nwhere: A = Maximum area of pool (square feet) for depth of one centimeter\nQS = Quantity released (pounds)\nDF = Density F"

The public receptors affected under this worst-case scenario include:  a school, a nursing home, private residences, and commercial, office, and/or industrial facilities.  According to a 1999 Environmental Data Resources \u00bf Offsite Receptor Report, the residential population within this 0.4-mile radius is approximately 3,419 persons.\n\n\n4.  The alternative release scenario:\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Na-Churs facility considers the potential release of ammonia through the transfer hose (rupture of the connection between the ammonia unloading station piping and the ammonia delivery tanker truck), resulting in a liquid spill and subsequent vaporization.\n\nThe following assumptions/conditions were utilized for the alternative scenario: \n\n- Initial operational flow rate of 200 gallons per minute;\n- Cross sectional area (3\u00bf pipe) of 7.065 inches;\n- Operational pipe pressure of 1 atm;\n- Change in pipe elevation of 1 foot;\n- Release duration of 0.3 minutes;\n- Urban topography; \n- Atmospheric stability class D;\n- Wind Speed of 3 meters/second; and\n- Ambient air temperature of 25 degrees Celsius\n \nUtilizing RMP*COMP, the distance to the toxic endpoint (0.14 mg/L) was determined to be < 0.1 miles.  The public receptors affected under this alternate scenario include: private residences, and commercial,"

The ammonia system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with applicable state law.\n\n\n6.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThe Na-Churs facility has never had an accidental release from the ammonia storage system resulting in deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place.  \n\n7.
