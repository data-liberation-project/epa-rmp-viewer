There have been no chlorine incidents in the most recent five-year history period.\n\nIn 1995, a Process Safety Management (PSM) program was initiated at the Plant using a consulting organization. A PSM Compliance Manual was developed for the site. Key items included in the manual were:\n\no Written site specific procedures for Employee Involvement, Management of Change, Incident Investigation, Pre-Startup Reviews and Self Audits.\n\nO Chlorine safety information as required by the regulations\n\no Standard Operating Procedures for chlorine management\n\no Chlorine system maintenance procedures \n\no Training on PSM and its key components including Management of Change, Mechanical Integrity and Incident Investigation.\n\nO Conducting  Process Hazards Analyses for the three chlorine processes\n\no Developing an initial Emergency Response Plan \n\no Training in support of the certification of operators\n          \nThe plant superintendent and the company safety managers annually review and update procedures and activities to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations. Recent activities include RMP Self-Audits in late 2003 and RMP training in March 2004. \n\nThe plant superintendent and company safety officer are meeting several times per year to review and update procedures and to maintain compliance with all aspects of the PSM/ RMP regulations.\n\nIn addition to RMP/PSM compliance, the plant has implemented a number of programs to improve the safe handling of chlorine and other chemicals.\n\nO In 1998, a full vacuum chlorine delivery system was installed inside a dedicated chemical storage building. The vacuum process has proven to greatly reduce leaks by reducing the amount of equipment th"

      "SummaryText": "at is exposed to pressurized chlorine.  \n\nO Plant inventories are being maintained to a maximum of 5 full cylinders of chlorine at the site.\n\nThe site's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has been significantly upgraded. In 1999, the ERP was revised to include offsite response and communication. The County LEPC and other local response organizations have been incorporated into the ERP. The services of a Hazmat Team to provide hazardous materials response has been obtained. Where necessary, communication plans have been developed to residences that may be impacted by a release. Chlorine Response Drills are being routinely conducted.\n\nAs well as RMP and PSM compliance, the organization has an active safety program. Hydro Management Services has an active Safety Committee. The committee meets monthly and its duties include reviewing new safety procedures, accident investigations, safety surveys and safety communications.\n\nAt the Wastewater Plant, there are monthly safety meetings to review an OSHA subject or discuss a safety issue. Routine training is conducted for topics such as:\n\n- Hazard Communications\n\n-Personal Protective Equipment\n\n-Lockout/Tagged\n\n-Confined Space\n\nAs a result of our programs, the plant has had an excellent safety record over the past three years. As mentioned earlier, there have been no reportable chlorine releases from the plant.  The plant has worked extensively to upgrade its safety program.\n\nReport by:\n\nGary Stainback                                                               \nDirector of Operations\nHydro Management Services, Inc."
