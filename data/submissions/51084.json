Lake Mary WTP has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA regulatory requirements.  A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at this facility is described below.\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n     The City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals. The City has also established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  To increase employee safety and awareness, the City:\n? Maintains up-to-date safety information and operating procedures,\n? Performs regular preventative maintenance,\n? Provides periodic refresher training on safe handling of chemicals, and\n? Conducts periodic drills.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n     Lake Mary WTP utilizes surface water supplies to produce potable water through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations. The regulated substance handled at Lake Mary WTP is chlorine.  The chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers, with a maximum of 7 containers (14,000 lbs) on site. \n\n\nRelease Scenarios\n     Worst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility.  These release scenarios have been performed in accordance with the regulation.\n\n     \nPrevention Steps for Chlorine\n     The prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA RMP rule, and includes:\n? formal and on-the-job training,\n? written operating procedures, and\n? a process equipment preventive maintenance progr"

      "SummaryText": "am.\n\nAccident History\n     There has been no release of the covered chemical in the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n     Lake Mary WTP has established and maintains an emergency response program that is coordinated with local response agencies.  The goals of the program are to protect on-site employees from the hazardous effects of a release and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n     Ideas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, a process hazard analysis of the chlorine system was conducted with key employees to fulfill the prevention program requirements. During these sessions, recommendations were make for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases.  Each recommendation will be or has been considered for implementation. In addition, the exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.  Prior to the initial start up of the new process, initial training was conducted to familiarize employees with the process systems, safety, and the operation & maintenance program."
