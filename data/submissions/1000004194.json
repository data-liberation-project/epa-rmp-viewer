Simplot company to provide a safe work environment for every employee and to protect them from injury and illness resulting from unsafe acts or conditions during hours of employment.  J.R. Simplot will also comply with all federal, state and local laws.  The Unit Director has the responsibility for leadership of the safety and health program, for its effectiveness and improvement and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n\nAmmonia safety programs are key items in the plant safety and health program.  J.R. Simplot takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increase that could cause a system failure, a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems.  A training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and emergency action procedures which enable trained personnel to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\nThe Boiler and Refrigeration Supervisor is responsible for the management of the ammonia safety programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJ.R. Simplot Company Caldwell Potato Plant produces frozen potato products for sale to the public.  The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to cool and freeze the food products and the production areas.  The maximum ammonia inventory at the plant is approximately 46,400 pounds.  Ammonia is the only regulated substance handled at the Caldwell Plant.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has a program level 3 accident release prevention program for the ammonia system that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Re"

Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have not been any ammonia-releated incidents at the Caldwell Plant during the previous five years that resulted in significant on-site or offsite consequences.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility does not have an emergency response plan. An emergency action plan has been implemented at the Caldwell Plant.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to fires, ammonia leaks and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.\n\nThe emergency Action program includes the following elements:\n\no Fire Plan\no Ammonia Leak Procedures\no Evacuation Procedures\n\nF. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nChanges were recommended to improve the equipment and the system operating procedures when the ammonia refrigeration system was analyzed in 4/24/09.  The recommended changes have been evaluated and will be implemented as required.\n"
