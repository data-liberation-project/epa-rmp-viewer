This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Lineage Logistics policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \n\nThe Program 3 at Lineage Logistics - Salem, is a facility run program with continuous support from Lineage Logistics - Compliance Department that includes; Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nLineage Logistics - Salem is located at 2525 Ewald Avenue SE, Salem. Oregon 97309., and it is situated approximately 1.3 miles west of Interstate 5. The area immediately surrounding the facility is mostly urban with some industrial and residential areas.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All of the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage Logistics - Salem, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over the 10,000-lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.  As a result, the anhydrous ammonia covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to OSHA PSM and EPA Program 3.\n\nProgr"
