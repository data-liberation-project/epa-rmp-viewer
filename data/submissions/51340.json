The portion of the Port facility that is subject to Risk Management Plan (RMP) regulations is operated by BP Amoco Chemicals Co. Green Lake, hereafter referred to as ?BP Amoco?.  The RMP incorporates the release prevention, emergency response, and training provisions of both the owner and operator, since these two entities coordinate implementation of on-site procedures to ensure that both Port and site BP Amoco employees are properly prepared to prevent and respond to emergencies.\n\n1.2   Owner History\n\nThe Port was constructed in the 1950s and designed to accommodate the transfer of chemicals and petrochemicals between ship or barge traffic and pipelines connected directly to remote client facilities.  In 1998, a major expansion of the Port was initiated to accommodate BP Amoco material transfers and storage.  An additional tank was commissioned in 2004.  The Port owns all equipment used to transfer and store chemicals at the facility, and BP Amoco is responsible for operation of the equipment to properly manage the chemicals.\n\n1.3   Operator History\n\nThe process used to produce BP Amoco Green Lake products contain quantities of listed hazardous chemicals that require application of Process Safety Management (PSM) as required in OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910 and the RMP.  BP Amoco has an outstanding environmental record and is an OSHA VPP Star site, is ISO 14000 certified, and is a participant of the Clean Texas 2000 initiative.  The facility has received the following awards:\n\n* ?Best In Texas? from the Texas Chemical Council for the years `89, `91, `92, `95, `96, `97, `98, `99, `00, ?02 and `03;\n\n* NPRA Gold Award  & Award for Achievement - `95, `97 and `98;\n\n* Governor?s Awar"

The model RMP*Comp Version 1.07 was used with default weather conditions for worst case and neutral conditions.\n\n2.0   Release Prevention Program\n\n2.1   Responsibility\n\nCompliance with the RMP is the responsibility of the Port Director.  The Port Director works in cooperation with the BP Amoco Plant Manager who is in direct consultation with the PSM/RMP Coordinator.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator provides technical expertise for process safety, communicates requirements to appropriate manufacturing managers, and coordinates policies and procedures to meet process safety requirements in support of the manufacturing areas.  Because the day-to-day operations at the Port facility associated with BP Amoco are the responsibility of BP Amoco, the PSM program has been developed by BP Amoco, along with the Process Hazard Analyses, Process Safety Information compilation, Standard Operating Procedures, Inspection and Testing procedures, and other safety-related programs.  Due to the nature of the owner/operator relationship, emergency planning and response procedures and plans have been a collaboration of the Port and BP Amoco.  Both the Port and BP Amoco employees who are assigned to Port operations undergo operating and emergency response training specific to the potential hazards related to management of acrylonitrile and ammonia at the Port.\n\n2.2   Employee Participation\n\nEmployee participation, as appropriate, in the development of all safety-related programs and procedures has been utilized to ensure the practicality of the systems and to advance the understanding "

All employees are properly trained in the applicable safety practices, policies and procedures to safely conduct the activities of their job assignments and to respond to emergency events.\n\n2.3   Process Safety Information\n\nBP Amoco has a compilation of process safety information (PSI).  The PSI is available for conducting process hazards analyses.  The PSI includes:\n\n* MSDS information pertaining to the hazards of the chemicals used or produced by the processes;\n\n* Information on the process technology including block flow diagrams or simplified process flow diagrams, process chemistry, maximum intended inventory, safe upper and lower limits and other information included in operating manuals and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs); and\n\n* Information on the equipment used including P&IDs, electrical classification, relief system design and design basis, ventilation systems, safety systems, material and energy balances for new processes and equipment.\n\nControlled copies of the PSI documents are kept in the department responsible for them.  The PSI documents are maintained through application of BP Amoco Green Lake Management of Change Procedure.  Management of Change also involves a technical review that ensures and documents that changes in equipment comply with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.

The hazards analyses are updated at least every five years.  The priority order for the initial hazards analyses are based on a documented rationale.\n\nThe PHAs are carried out using acceptable methodology and address:\n\n* Hazards of the process;\n* Previous incidents;\n* Engineering and administrative controls;\n* Consequences of failure of controls;\n* Facility siting;\n* Human factors; and\n* Qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects.\n\nThe PHAs are performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations.  The teams include at least one employee with experience and knowledge in the process as well as one person knowledgeable in the PHA methodology being used.  All PHA recommendations are addressed and resolved with appropriate documentation in a timely manner.  Planned actions are adequately managed with scheduled milestone completion times.  PHA reports and documentation are retained for the life of the process.  The PSM/RMP Coordinator is assigned to provide leadership for ensuring that the process hazards analyses are in accordance with requirements.

Procedures are routinely reviewed for content at least every three years depending on the criticality of the procedure as determined by the area managers or their designee.  Procedures are also modified and updated as needed as part of management of change.  Each Area Manager certifies annually that the operating procedures are current and accurate for process units within their area of responsibility.\n\nThe Area Manager is responsible for maintaining operating procedures for their department.
