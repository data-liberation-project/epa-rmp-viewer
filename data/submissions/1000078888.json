One component of this system is a program to manage the risks of accidental releases at the Pasadena PVC facility.  This program conforms to the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's regulation 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirement Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule) and the requirements of OSHA 1910.119.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP plan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at the Pasadena PVC facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled [68.155(b)]\n\n\n\nThe Occidental Chemical Corporation - Pasadena PVC Plant facility handles one chemical regulated by the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Prevention Steps [68.155(c)]\n\n\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility's prevention program has been prepared so that it conforms to both the OSHA Process Safety Management and the EPA Risk Management Program regulations.  The program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information, Process Hazard Analysis, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Review, Compliance Audits, Incident Investigation, Employee Participation, Key Procedures, Contractors.\n\n\n\nEach of the elements listed above are documented, and routinely reviewed for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History [68.155(d)]\n\n\n\nThere were not any RMP accidents at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program [68.155(e)]\n\n\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility has established a written emergency response plan and maintains an emergency response te"

The drills are used to test the response time of the Emergency Response Team, to test the plant employee accountability program, and to activate the plant's Emergency Command Center (\"ECC\").  In addition, the Pasadena PVC facility has developed a Special Situations Plan (\"SSP\") which is a program designed for responding to emergencies that may have impacts beyond the immediate plant and is a supplement to the Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe facility is a member of the Southeast Regional Local Emergency Planning Committee (\"LEPC\"), which includes industrial and public entities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety [68.155(f)]\n\n\n\nThe Pasadena PVC facility constantly tries to improve the safety of the processes through annual reviews of our plant procedures, near misses and incident investigation programs, and a program soliciting safety and environmental suggestions from the plant employees.  Specific changes include installation of additional process controls and enhancements related to the automated isolation of storage spheres and DCS monitoring of process operating conditions.\n\n"
