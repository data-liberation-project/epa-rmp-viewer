      "SummaryText": "The Springettsbury Township\u00bfs Wastewater Treatment Facility is a regional wastewater treatment plant which serves Springettsbury Township and surrounding communities. As part of normal operations (disinfection of wastewater), the facility receives, stores, and handles containers of liquid chlorine.  As a result, accidental release prevention and emergency response policies have been instituted which include: operating and maintenance procedures; training and incident investigation programs for handling chlorine; notification of key plant personnel during an emergency; immediately available SCBA and protective equipment to be used only by trained personnel; an on-site emergency response plan and procedures for notification of local emergency planning individuals in the event local emergency response is needed.\nThe chlorine-specific accidental release prevention steps in place at the facility provides written procedures that incorporate operational and maintenance data and training procedures for dependable use of relief valves, leak detection systems, shut-off systems and alarms.  Mitigation systems in use include complete enclosure of the chlorine supply and chlorination system.\nNo accidents have occurred in the last five years.  Procedures are in place to identify and record any future accidents or incidents.\nAn on-site Emergency Response Program, including an evacuation plan, assembly areas and other safety information has been developed.  This program has been coordinated with the \u00bfOff-Site Hazardous Materials Response Plan\u00bf, which has been prepared in conjunction with the Local Emergency Management Agency and was included as part of the Program.\nThe Township plans to continue updating the program as required and will review all portions of the program at least every five years and as necessary as on-site conditions change. The operations staff receives response training annually."
