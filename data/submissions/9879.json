THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT OUR FACILITY.\n    THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH NFPA-58 REQUIREMENTS FOR LP GAS STORAGE, AND IT IS OUR POLICY TO ADHERE TO ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS.  IF AN EMERGENCY WERE TO OCCUR, IT IS OUR POLICY TO NOTIFY THE GIRARD FIRE DEPARTMENT AND REQUEST THAT THEY RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY.\n2.  A DESCRIPTION OF OUR FACILITY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES.\n   THIS FACILITY SELLS PROPANE ON THE RETAIL LEVEL TO CONSUMERS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 134,000 POUNDS IN OUR TWO 18,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A TANKER TRUCK HOLDING 35,640 POUNDS.\n3.  THE WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n    A.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS FAILURE OF ONE OF OUR 18,000 GALLON TANKS WHEN FILLED TO THE GREATEST CAPACITY ALLOWED (88% AT 60F), RESULTING IN A VAPOR CLOUD EXPLOSION.  ACCORDING TO EPA'S LOOK UP TABLES, THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT IS .5 MILES.\n    B.  THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO IS BASED ON A LINE BREAKING WHILE PUMPING.  THE DISTANCE TO ENDPOINT IS .1 MILES WITH A TOTAL RELEASE OF 4,660 POUNDS.\n4.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n    THIS FACILITY COMPLIES WITH EPA'S ACCIDENT PREVENTION RULE AND ALL APPLICABLE STATE AND LOCAL CODES AND REGULATIONS.  THE PROPANE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED, INSTALLED AND MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH NFPA-58 AND THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL.\n5.  THE FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n    THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTS INVOLVING PROPANE THAT CAUSED DEATHS, INJURIES, PROPERTY OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, EVACUATIONS, OR SHELTERINGS IN PLACE.\n6.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n    IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY INVOLVING OUR PROPANE SYSTEM, IT IS OUR POLICY TO NOTIFY THE GIRARD FIRE DEPARTMENT AND REQUEST THAT THEY RESPOND TO THE EMERGENCY.  WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS POLICY WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAVE INSPECTED OUR PROPANE SYSTEM.\n7.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE S"
