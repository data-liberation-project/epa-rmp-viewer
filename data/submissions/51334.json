It is the policy of Nor-Am Ice & Cold Plant C to comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations, and to conduct its business in an environmentally sound manner that avoids any unreasonable adverse impact on the environment or its neighboring community.\n\nIn keeping with this policy, Nor-Am Ice & Cold, Plant C is continuing to develop and implement OSHA's Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119(o) and EPA's Risk Management 40 CFR Part 68 programs to ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community.  \n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nNor-Am Ice & Cold, Plant C operates as a cold storage warehouse.  The major process is the storage and distribution of ice.  Ice is delivered to and from this facility by trucks.\n\nThe only RMP regulated chemical handled by Nor-Am Ice & Cold, Plant C at the Saint Joseph, Missouri facility, is anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia is used at the facility in the refrigeration system for cooling the building, and cooling and freezing ice.  The anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system.   Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to the facility by supplier tank trucks to initially charge the system and occasionally thereafter to replenish the system from periodic maintenance.  \n\nWorst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\n\nAs stipulated in EPA guidelines, 40 CFR Part 68.25, the worst-case and alternate case release scenarios were calculated for the covered process at the Nor-Am Ice & Cold, Plant C facility. \n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Nor-Am Ice & Cold, Plant C, Saint Joseph, Missouri facility is subject to both EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention program and OSHAA?s Process Safety Management (PSM) program.

The Emergency Action Plan focuses on evacuation of the facility in the event of an ammonia emergency, with the local emergency response agencies performing rescue, firefighting, first-aid, medical treatment, and other response functions. The facility is continuing to develop and implement a written Emergency Action Plan which documents specific procedures to be implemented in the event of various emergencies, including ammonia releases.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nUpgrade and update safety programs as warranted and needed.\n"
