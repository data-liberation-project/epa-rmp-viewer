      "SummaryText": "Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nPPL Montour LLC Risk Management Planning policy provides a unified approach to prevent accidental releases of chemicals including anhydrous ammonia through the integration of engineering and administrative controls.  All applicable procedures from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to.  PPL Montour LLC has developed accidental release mitigation policies specific to the covered process and chemical which are supported by other safety policies implemented by the plant.  The PPL Montour LLC emergency response program policy dictates the implementation of response plans detailed specifically to the PPL Montour LLC covered process and chemical and to the emergency response services available in the community.  An offsite emergency response plan, developed by the Montour County Emergency Management Agency, has been in-place for other chemicals at the site.  That plan has been modified to include anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nThe PPL Montour LLC facility, located in Montour County is a fossil fuel based steam and electric plant.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.  NOx is reduced by mixing and reacting with ammonia in the presence of a catalyst.  The anhydrous ammonia system includes railcars, and tanker trucks, bulk tanks, process piping, various safety & monitoring systems, compressors, and pumps.  This system is typically manned, and is monitored daily by operators.  The system was originally used on a seasonal basis in warm weather, but is now used year round. Maintenance employees are on staff to respond to any alarms and to maintain the system.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nAdministrative controls have been developed to minimize the potential for release and consequences.  These controls consist of storage volume limitations, dikes ar"

Mitigation measures employed consist of process equipment perimeter ammonia detectors, overhead sprinkler system to knock down ammonia gas, and computerized alarms and interlocks.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release program for anhydrous ammonia is as follows:\n\n* Operation, maintenance, safety, and emergency response training for employees who operate, maintain, inspect, and work with the ammonia system.\n\n* Effective, detailed procedures for maintenance, operation and troubleshooting of the systems.\n\n* Preventative maintenance programs in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations and/or industry standards to maintain the mechanical integrity of the system.\n\n* A Management of Change program that identifies potential concerns and addresses these concerns before system changes are implemented.\n\n* A compliance audit program that reviews conformance to the standards.\n\n* Contracting of vendors with ammonia handling experience, written safety policies, and training in ammonia use, awareness, and response.\n\n* Effective Management support of all program elements.\n\n\n\nAccident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents during the operation of the anhydrous ammonia system.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nMontour SES has a comprehensive emergency response plan, including an Off-Site plan that has been developed in coordination with the Montour County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).  Montour SES has contracted emergency responders trained in accordance with the appropriate levels of response; responders who can specifically handle potential releases of anhydrous ammonia.
