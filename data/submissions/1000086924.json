The PHA Revalidation study included a HAZOP process using Guidewords / checklists and a facility inspection.  The PHA Revalidation provided mitigation measures to improve safety at the DFA - Goshen facility located at 1110 South 9th Street in Goshen, Indiana.  As a result of the PHA Revalidation, a number of recommendations were made, such as some equipment upgrades and improvement of existing safety procedures and piping diagrams.  \r\n\r\nThe DFA - Goshen safety committee is also planning to complete several items over the next year, as a continual effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\r\n\r\n1.\tContinue to train all employees in the facility Safety Plan/Programs.\r\n2.\tContinue to have employee involvement in Safety Plan Development.\r\n3.\tContinue employee involvement through safety team participation.\r\n4.\tContinue internal and external safety audits/inspections and implement changes as needed."

This prevention program covers the process that handles ammonia above the threshold quantity of either PSM or RMP rules.\r\n\r\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.
