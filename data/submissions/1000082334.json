              "Description": "Tank Farm\n\nBasic Process Description\n\n     The tank farm is used for the storage of crude oil, finished products that will either be sold as a finished product or blended with other stocks, and products that will be used as stocks for other refinery processes. Tanks range in size from 310,000 barrels to less than 1,000 barrels.  \n\n\n\nInspections:\n\n    Tanks are inspected on a scheduled basis using inspection intervals established by regulatory, industry standards (API,NBIC,ASME), and recognized best practices. Inspection intervals, tracking, and completion of inspections are handled by the refinery MI (Mechanical Integrity) program/group.\n\n\n\nOngoing management\n\n     The ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements. Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which require modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review. Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets). Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.  The Refinery has not had any incidents involving the tank farm that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release in the last 5 years.  \n\n\n\n     Marathon calculated the mass of RMP regulated flammable materials in each tank using detailed engineering calculations.   Per 68.115(b)(2) tanks that contain less than 1% by weight of a regulated substance in a mixture, the mixture is not included in the total quantity calculations for comparison against the threshold quantity.  In addition, tanks whose contents do not have a National Fire Protection Association flammability hazard rating of 4 were not included in the total quantity calculation per 68.115(b)(2).  The RMP regulation also includes exemptions for gasoline and Naturally occurring hydrocarbon mixtures [68.115(b)(2)(i) and 68.115(b)(2)(ii)].  The total mass of RMP regulated flammable materials in the tank farm is 4,000,000 lbs\n\n",

              "Description": "Partial Recycle Isomerization Process (P.R.I.P.)\n\nBasic Process Description\n\n      This process takes the light straight run gasoline produced in the Crude Unit and, through a reaction process, converts into a higher-octane gasoline component called isomerate.  Hydrogen from the Hydrogen Unit is used in this process. A small amount of LPG is also produced as a by-product.\n\n\n\nInspections\n\n      The preventative maintenance program for the P.R.I.P unit includes periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) inspections of the unit components.  The inspection and testing schedule is based on a risk based mechanical integrity (RBMI) program, applicable standards, manufacturer?s recommendations, and best engineering practices.   The P.R.I.P. unit is involved in major plant turnarounds approximately every four years, during which the process is shut down for maintenance and inspections.  Additional testing and maintenance are performed during slowdowns, which occur approximately every two years.  The last turnaround and slowdown occurred in 2016 and 2018, respectively.  \n\n\n\nOngoing management\n\n     The ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements. Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which require modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review. Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets). Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.  The Refinery has not had any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n     Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated flammable substances using detailed engineering calculations.  The P.R.I.P. unit contains a number of RMP regulated flammable mixtures totaling 120,000 lbs.\n\n",

              "Description": "Diesel Desulfurization Unit\n\nBasic process description:\n\n     The Diesel Desulfurization Unit (DDU) uses a hydrotreating process to remove sulfur from the No. 2 Diesel (DF2) and Arctic Diesel (DFA) produced in the Crude Unit.  To do this, the hydrotreating process converts the sulfur in the diesel to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) that is stripped out of the diesel products in the Fractionation section of the unit.  The DDU produces diesel products with a sulfur content below 15 ppm. At this sulfur level, the products meet the Environmental Protection Agency's Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) specification. The two ULSD products made in the DDU are a summer-grade diesel called No. 2-D S15 and a winter-grade diesel called No. 1-D S15. The DDU also produces a sour naphtha product that is piped to the Hydrocracker to be stabilized and a sour off-gas that is sweetened in the Amine Unit before being used as fuel gas in the refinery.\n\n\n\nInspections\n\n      The preventative maintenance program for the DDU unit includes periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) inspections of the unit components.  The inspection and testing schedule is based on a risk based mechanical integrity (RBMI) program, applicable standards, manufacturer?s recommendations, and best engineering practices.   The DDU unit is involved in major plant turnarounds approximately every four years, during which the process is shut down for maintenance and inspections.  Additional testing and maintenance are performed during slowdowns, which occur approximately every two years.  The last turnaround and slowdown occurred in 2016 and 2018, respectively.  \n\n\n\nOngoing management\n\n     The ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements. Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which require modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review. Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets). Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.  The Refinery has not had any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n     Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated flammable substances using detailed engineering calculations.  The DDU unit contains a number of RMP regulated flammable mixtures totaling 17,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n",

              "Description": "Amine Unit & Flare Gas Recovery Unit\n\n\n\nBasic Process Description    \n\n     The Amine Unit uses a solvent to absorb hydrogen sulfide out of the LPG and fuel gases that are produced in the Crude Unit, Vacuum Unit, Hydrocracker and Reformer. The absorption is accomplished in scrubbing towers located at the southwest corner of the Hydrocracker. The scrubbed LPG is sent to the DIB Unit for further processing. The scrubbed fuel gas is piped to the refinery fuel gas system where it is used for process heaters and utility steam boilers.  The hydrogen sulfide rich amine is sent to the Amine Regeneration section of the process. In this section, the hydrogen sulfide is stripped out of the amine and sent to the Sulfur Recovery Unit. The regenerated amine is cooled and circulated back to through the scrubbers.\n\n\n\n     The Flare Gas Recovery Unit consists of 2 compressors and related equipment that takes suction from the refinery flare headers and return the gas to the refinery fuel system.  A seal drum keeps flare gas from the flare, yet provides an outlet to the flare during a major unit upset.  \n\n\n\nInspections\n\n     The preventative maintenance program for the Amine unit and the Flare Gas Recovery Unit includes periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) inspections of the unit components.  The inspection and testing schedule is based on a risk based mechanical integrity (RBMI) program, applicable standards, manufacturer?s recommendations, and best engineering practices.   The Amine unit and Flare Gas Recovery Unit are involved in major plant turnarounds approximately every four years, during which the process is shut down for maintenance and inspections.  Additional testing and maintenance are performed during slowdowns, which occur approximately every two years.  The last turnaround and slowdown occurred in 2016 and 2018, respectively.  \n\n\n\nOngoing Management\n\n     The ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements. Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which require modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review. Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets). Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.  The Refinery has not had any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n     Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated flammable substances using detailed engineering calculations.  The Amine unit and the Flare Gas Recovery Unit contains a number of RMP regulated flammable mixtures totaling 83,000 lbs.  The total quantity of hydrogen sulfide in the Amine unit and Flare Gas Recovery unit is below the 10,000 lb RMP threshold.\n\n\n\n",

              "Description": "Crude Unit\n\nBasic Process Description\n\n     The Crude Unit is the first process in converting crude oil into petroleum products. This unit takes the oil and heats it to approx.. 700 degrees F and injects it into a tower where, through distillation, products such as diesel and jet fuel are produced. Also distilled out of the crude oil is heavier oil called gas oil, which is sent to the Hydrocracker for further processing.  Naphtha and light straight run gasoline are produced as feed-stocks for the Reformer and PRIP Units.  Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is also distilled out of the crude oil. This is processed in the Amine Unit to remove hydrogen sulfide before being sent on to the Deisobutanizer and LPG units, which separate the LPG into propane and butane.  Petroleum gases that are produced from the crude oil are also sent to the Amine Unit for hydrogen sulfide removal and then used as fuel gas for the refinery heaters and boilers.\n\n\n\n     After distilling all of these products from the crude oil, the residue is removed from the bottom of the distillation tower and sent to the Vacuum Unit for further processing.\n\n\n\nInspections\n\n      The preventative maintenance program for the Crude unit includes periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) inspections of the unit components.  The inspection and testing schedule is based on a risk based mechanical integrity (RBMI) program, applicable standards, manufacturer?s recommendations, and best engineering practices.   The Crude unit is involved in major plant turnarounds approximately every four years, during which the process is shut down for maintenance and inspections.  Additional testing and maintenance are performed during slowdowns, which occur approximately every two years.  The last turnaround and slowdown occurred in 2016 and 2018, respectively.  \n\n\n\nOngoing management\n\n     The ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements. Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which require modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review. Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets). Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.  The Refinery has not had any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n     Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated flammable substances using detailed engineering calculations.  The Crude unit contains a number of RMP regulated flammable mixtures totaling 1,000,000 lbs. ",

              "Description": "(LPG) Liquefied Petroleum Gas Unit Basic Process Description\n\n     The LPG unit separates the remaining fuel gas from the LPG that has been processed in the DIB Unit. It then takes the LPG and separates it into Propane and Iso-butane. The propane stored in Tank 80 is sold commercially. The Iso-butane is vaporized and used as fuel gas and/or stored in Tank 70 to be used as a blending component for gasoline.  \n\n\n\nInspections\n\n     The preventative maintenance program for the LPG unit includes periodic (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) inspections of the unit components.  The inspection and testing schedule is based on a risk based mechanical integrity program (RBMI), applicable standards, manufacturer?s recommendations, and best engineering practices.   The LPG unit is involved in major plant turnarounds approximately every four years, during which the process is shut down for maintenance and inspections.  Additional testing and maintenance are performed during slowdowns, which occur approximately every two years.  The last turnaround and slowdown occurred in 2016 and 2018, respectively.  \n\n\n\nOngoing management\n\n     The ongoing management of refinery process hazards requires the regular implementation of many PSM/RMP prevention elements. Changes regularly occur in refinery processes, which require modifications to the process safety information, implementation of the management of change procedure, and require a pre-startup safety review. Incident Reports are written regularly to document and investigate incidents that resulted in; property damage, environmental contamination, vehicle accidents, and injuries including first aid or incidents that may have resulted in something occurring (such as process upsets). Incident Reports are considered a key component in our overall prevention program as we focus on learning from small incidents before they become significant.  The Refinery has not had any incidents that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release in the last 5 years. \n\n\n\n     Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated flammable substances using detailed engineering calculations.  The LPG unit contains a number of RMP regulated flammable mixtures totaling 41,000 lbs.\n\n",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Marathon Kenai Refinery, located in Nikiski, Alaska, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from crude oil.  The refinery uses or produces several regulated flammables, such as pentane, propane and butane.  Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated substances using detailed engineering calculations.  \n\n\n\nThe 2019 Resubmittal includes the 2017 update for the Flare Gas Recovery Unit within the Amine Unit, and the 2014 update for the Mega Splitter within the Crude Unit.  No other major process changes have occurred at the facility and the chemical quantities are unchanged from the latest submittal.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for the Marathon Kenai Refinery were reviewed to ensure all modeling inputs, including process volumes and composition, are still valid. The Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) has not changed since the 2011 submissions, with the exception of current population estimates within the radius of impacts (ROI) of the WCS and ARS made during the 2014 recertification.  Marathon evaluated the populations within the ROI's using MARPLOT, an EPA tool that utilizes 2010 census"

The Kenai Refinery has had an excellent record of accident prevention since the start of our operation in 1969.  In fact, we have never experienced an incident that impacted people or property outside of the Refinery since 1969.  One reason for our success at preventing accidents is that we investigate even minor incidents promptly and thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  Thus, we can eliminate many problems before they become accidents.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Kenai Refinery.  This program includes the required elements of our Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Refinery maintains technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  The documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Refinery has developed procedures for operating the processes within safe limits for temperature, level, composition, pressure, etc.  The Refinery ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform PHA evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and is considered adequate for the complexity of the processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA's are facilitated by someone with experience with the selected method.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed and resolved by local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  PSSR is integrated into the Management of Change (MOC) program and is required for every MOC.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years by a Corporate approved/appointed audit team, or a third party consulting firm mixed with Marathon personnel from across the Corporation.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably had the potential to have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release, that could have caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are utilized by operators and maintenance personnel and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  They are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nThe operating procedures at the Refinery provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit variances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators as electronic files on computers located in the control rooms and in hard copy for all emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or working within a RMP-covered process.  New employees receive 40 hours of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) basic training.  Personnel in refinery operations receive an additional six weeks of job-specific training. "
