This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Marathon Kenai Refinery, located in Nikiski, Alaska, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, propane, butane, and gasoline) from crude oil.  The refinery uses or produces several regulated flammables, such as pentane, propane and butane.  Marathon calculated the quantity of RMP regulated substances using detailed engineering calculations.  \n\n\n\nThe 2019 Resubmittal includes the 2017 update for the Flare Gas Recovery Unit within the Amine Unit, and the 2014 update for the Mega Splitter within the Crude Unit.  No other major process changes have occurred at the facility and the chemical quantities are unchanged from the latest submittal.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) and an alternative release scenario (ARS) for the Marathon Kenai Refinery were reviewed to ensure all modeling inputs, including process volumes and composition, are still valid. The Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) has not changed since the 2011 submissions, with the exception of current population estimates within the radius of impacts (ROI) of the WCS and ARS made during the 2014 recertification.  Marathon evaluated the populations within the ROI's using MARPLOT, an EPA tool that utilizes 2010 census"

The Kenai Refinery has had an excellent record of accident prevention since the start of our operation in 1969.  In fact, we have never experienced an incident that impacted people or property outside of the Refinery since 1969.  One reason for our success at preventing accidents is that we investigate even minor incidents promptly and thoroughly to determine ways to prevent similar incidents from occurring.  Thus, we can eliminate many problems before they become accidents.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Kenai Refinery.  This program includes the required elements of our Process Safety Management (PSM) program.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Refinery maintains technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  The documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the Refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The Refinery has developed procedures for operating the processes within safe limits for temperature, level, composition, pressure, etc.  The Refinery ensures that the processes are maintained within these limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The Refinery also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Refinery has a comprehensive PHA program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\n\n\nThe Refinery primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis method to perform PHA evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and is considered adequate for the complexity of the processes.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The PHA's are facilitated by someone with experience with the selected method.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed and resolved by local management.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA"

A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  PSSR is integrated into the Management of Change (MOC) program and is required for every MOC.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Refinery periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years by a Corporate approved/appointed audit team, or a third party consulting firm mixed with Marathon personnel from across the Corporation.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Refinery promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably had the potential to have resulted in, a fire, explosion, or toxic gas release, that could have caused major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to Refinery management for resolution.

Periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as unit startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are utilized by operators and maintenance personnel and provide a basis for consistent training of new employees.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  They are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\n\n\nThe operating procedures at the Refinery provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit variances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators as electronic files on computers located in the control rooms and in hard copy for all emergency procedures.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process or working within a RMP-covered process.  New employees receive 40 hours of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) basic training.  Personnel in refinery operations receive an additional six weeks of job-specific training. "

After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  Before operating in a process operators must be certified by demonstrating adequate skill and knowledge in that specific process.  All operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted routinely with the maximum time frame to be at least every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.

Changes are reviewed to:\n\n(1)    Ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards;\n\n(2)    Verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change;\n\n(3)    Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes; and\n\n(4)    Operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSR)\n\nThe Refinery conducts a PSSR for any facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides an additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the des"

Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  \n\n?    Employees have access to all information created as part of the Refinery Safety Program.  \n\n?    Regularly held safety meetings in each department are one way in which employees are able to participate in the review and development of programs and work practices. \n\n?    An Employee Safety Steering Committee was established to promote employee feedback and participation.  This committee is represented by one individual from each department and is responsible for gathering employee feedback and promoting participation. \n\n?     Other specific ways that employees can be involved in the Refinery Safety Program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery.\n\n\n\nHot Work Permit\n\nThe purpose to this Hot work program is to establish a written policy to prevent fires resulting from any temporary work involving open flames, welding, burning, spark producing, or anything else that could create an ignition source.  A Hot Work Permit is required for any hot work performed within a covered process area.    \n\n\n\nContractors\n\nThe Refinery uses contractors to supplement its work force.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the Refinery has a contractor management program in place to ensure that contractors: \n\n(1)    Perform their work in a safe manner;\n\n(2)    Have the appropriate knowledge and skills;\n\n(3)    Are aware of the hazards in their workplace;\n\n(4)    Understand what they sho"

The Refinery uses a third party consulting company who evaluates and monitors contractor qualifications and safety records.  Contractors are to be approved before they enter the Refinery.  Refinery personnel periodically monitor contractor performance through job site audits and the third party consulting company reports to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  The information and data from the audits is communicated to contractors to facilitate continuous improvement.  \n\n\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the Kenai refinery have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the Kenai refinery.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures or human errors. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, the Refinery has safety features on many units to help contain and control a release, quickly detect a release, and reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n?    Portable hydrocarbon detectors;\n\n?    Heat, smoke, and flam"
