The facility receives, raw natural gas and treats the gas to remove water (H2O). DT has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. The plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs. Employees receive training in the procedures to be followed by employees who remain to operate critical plant operations before they evacuate. DT has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police, Sheriff's Office, or similar). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, DT conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel. DT's management is committed to the following: 1. Preventing accidents; 2. Training our employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident; 3. Participating in community emergency preparedness; 4. Addressing any citizen concerns by fully ex"
