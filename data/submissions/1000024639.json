      "SummaryText": "The Dannon Company Inc. West Jordan Plant is a dairy food manufacturer that contains a refrigeration system for cooling the product in the process and storage. The refrigeration system utilizes anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia, a substance regulated by EPA, is one of the most economical refrigerants available. However, the properties of ammonia makes it necessary to observe certain safety precautions while operating the refrigeration system to prevent employee exposure, and to reduce the threat of exposure to nearby members of the community.\n\nThe Dannon Company Inc. West Jordan Plant has opted to follow the EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Rule, Program Level 3, to help prevent a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. The amount of ammonia estimated to be contained inside the refrigeration system is 14,324 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe Dannon Company Inc. West Jordan Plant complies with EPA's Chemical Accidental Release Prevention Rule, and applicable state codes and regulations to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. The ammonia refrigeration system has been constructed according to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines (IIAR). The operators are required to complete a training and certification program to operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\n\nThe Accidental Release Prevention Program does not guarantee against an accidental release. An offsite consequence analysis was completed using a computer model to simulate a release of the ammonia from the refrigeration system. This information is available onsite. An alternative release scenario, which is the most likely scenario, was also considered and is also available onsite.\n\n\n\nThe Dannon Company Inc. West Jordan Plant has an established Emergency Action Plan to respond to emergencies. The plan was developed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.38. The plan requires Dannon Employees to exit the facility during a fire or ammonia release to a safe area. The emergency agencies will be not"

Dannon maintenance employees will be available as a resource during an ammonia release emergency. The plan also addresses natural hazard emergencies, fires, bomb threats, civil disturbances, and utility outages.\n\n\n\nThis location has not experienced an ammonia release in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nThe Dannon Company Inc. West Jordan Plant wanted to evaluate the potential failures of the refrigeration system, and if the safeguards were sufficient to prevent a catastrophic release of ammonia. An initial Process Hazard Analysis was completed and was last re-validated in 2007. Planned changes to improve safety resulting from this analysis are documented in the Process Hazard Analysis report in the Risk Management Program. Also, the guidelines from the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) will be followed where applicable, to manage the refrigeration system."
