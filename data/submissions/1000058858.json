The New Town Water Plant employees do not respond to releases other than those that can be stopped by closing a valve and will not enter the room to stop a chlorine release if the chlorine concentration is estimated to be above safe levels.  The New Town Water Plant relies on the Mountrail County LEPC and Municipal Fire Department to manage response procedures in the event of a major chlorine release at the facility. \r\n \r\nThe New Town Water Plant is committed to comprehensive employee training and communication with offsite responders in the event of a major chlorine release.  The facility has examined the hazards associated with the regulated process, identified additional safety measures, and set a schedule for implementation of those safety measures.  The New Town Water Plant intends to use the Risk Management Program as a means to operate more safely and efficiently and to communicate more effectively with offsite responders and the public it serves."

      "SummaryText": "The New Town Water Plant, as part of 2014-2016 plant expansion, has added chlorine storage at the Water Plant.  On-site chlorine storage will include room for two (2) one (1)-ton cylinders replacing two (2) 150-pound cylinders. The additional storage requires the filing of a Risk Management Plan (RMP) to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) complying with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  As part of the development of this report New Town has updated associated emergency response procedures and communication procedures with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and Municipal Fire Department to form a cooperative response to potential releases at the facility.  The prevention program focuses on training employees in safe operating and maintenance procedures and to recognize the potential hazards of the regulated chemical and processes.\r\n \r\nThe New Town Water Plant is located on the southwest side of the City of New Town.  The 2,000 gallons per minute (gpm) plant was constructed in 2013 and expanded in 2016. The facility is owned and operated by the City of New Town. The facility can treat 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD). The facility is ground water plant using lime softening, recarbonation, fluoridation, stabilization, and chlorine/chloramine disinfection.  Chlorine is introduced into the water using a vacuum feed system.  If the vacuum is broken on any of the distribution lines the chlorinators will automatically shut down.  \r\n\r\nTo minimize the potential for an accidental chlorine release the City of New Town has installed total containment systems for each of the one-ton cylinders stored on site.  The containment system is manufactured by TGO Technologies, Inc, and is referred to as a ChlorTainer. ChlorTainer is a total confinement system employing a self-contained vessel within which the ton cylinder is stored and chemical is fed, minimizing risk from a chlorine leak at the New Town Water Plant. ClorTainers are housed in the chlo"

The room is equipped with a high volume ventilation system that starts when the room light is turned on. The New Town Water Plant operates the facility approximately 12-hours per day, seven (7) days per week depending on water demands. The chlorine room and its components are visually inspected at least once per day during operation.  The door to the chlorine room is kept locked at all times.  In addition to the exhaust system, an observation window between the plant and the chlorine room allows the room to be visually checked before entering. A chlorine leak detector is located inside the storage area. \r\n\r\nThe New Town Water Department Foreman will have overall responsibility for maintaining and implementing this procedure.  The purpose of the RMP is to ensure that responsibilities are assigned for all program elements and that all parties participating in the RMP understand their respective roles.\r\n\r\nThe New Town Water Plant has examined their chlorination system and the potential hazards it presents onsite and offsite and formulated a scenario to alert the public to the worst possible release.  The Worst Case Scenario for this facility involves the release of 2,000 pounds of gaseous chlorine (the entire contents of one (1) container), directly into the atmosphere, over a 10-minute period.  The analysis estimated that a release of this magnitude would create a radius of influence of 3.0 miles.  The radius of influence represents the distance the chlorine plume would travel from the facility, under assumed meteorological conditions, before the concentration is reduced below the Emergency Response Planning Guideline 2 (ERPG-2) level, the \"toxic endpoint\".  A population of 2,269, or 100 percent of the total population of the City of New Town, resides within this radius.  The USEPA requires that the radius of influence is calculated considering a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second,"

This scenario involves a release occurring inside the chlorine room. The alternate scenario modeled for this facility involves a leak from the lead gasket between the regulating valve and the chlorine container after the cylinder is being placed in the ChlorTainer.  Each time a new cylinder is connected to the system, a new lead gasket is installed prior to being placed in the ChlorTainer.  Although the gasket is checked for leaks immediately after installation, the alternate scenario assumes a small leak is not detected prior to sealing the Chlortainer vessel. The leak continues throughout the night and the entire contents of the vessel are released over a period of 855 minutes (14\u00bc hours).  Because the vessel is inside a chlortainer within the enclosed chlorine storage area, the room and ChlorTainer act as a passive mitigation measures and contain the release.  A conservative radius of influence for this release is 0.2-mile with  approximately 82 household located within this radius.  In recognition of this potential release, the New Town Water Plant will integrate RMP training with their existing training program.  Increased employee awareness of the consequences of even a small release is expected to further reduce the likelihood of such a scenario occurring\r\n\r\nPrior to the submission of this plan the New Town Water Plant has not had any incidents involving chlorine that have resulted in an injury.  \r\n\r\nThe prevention program documents procedures within the facility that promote safe operation of the regulated process and reduce the potential for an uncontrolled release of the regulated substance (chlorine gas).
