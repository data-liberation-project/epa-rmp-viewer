Moreover, the worst-case meteorological conditions for Wellford are incorporated into the endpoint distance of the trimethylamine gas release. The conditions are assumed to be:  temperature of (39oC, humidity 68%) and a windspeed 1.5 m/sec. Within ten minutes all the contents in the tank are released (51,840 pounds) and a vapor cloud explosion occurs. The distance to the endpoint for this vapor cloud explosion (i.e. one pound per square inch) extends beyond the facility's property line.  The distance to endpoint includes a residential population and industrial facilities. \n\nAlternate Release Scenarios\n\nSeven alternate release scenarios are examined for the facility.  The first scenario involves the failure of the formaldehyde reaction vessel, causing a liquid pool to form.  Three plausible situations can occur involving the trimethylamine process: failure of the reaction vessel, causing a vapor cloud explosion; failure of the reaction vessel, causing a flash fire; and failure of the storage vessel, causing a pool fire.   The fifth, sixth, and seventh scenarios all involve the ethylenediamine storage vessel.  The fifth scenario involves the complete failure of the storage vessel, the sixth scenario entails a release from a 1/4 hole in the tank, and the seventh situation describes a flange release.  The sixth and seventh release scenarios are situations that are more likely to occur than the other scenarios due to the facility's past history and the area's surrounding industry release incidents.  Typical meteorological conditions for Wellford, South Carolina are used to determine the five alternate scenarios.  The average temperature is 16 oC, humidity 68%, and windspeed 3.1 m/sec.  \n\nAlternate Scenario 1: There is assumed"

The solution evaporates at a rate of 2.9 lbs./minute for 8 hours, resulting in an endpoint distance beyond the facility's property line. The radius of concern includes a residential population and industrial facilities.\n\nAlternate Scenario 2: There is assumed to be a complete failure of the trimethylamine vessel, resulting in a total release of the gas, causing a vapor cloud explosion.

A five-year accident history is defined by the RMP regulations to include accidents related to regulated chemicals that result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  Sybron Chemicals has not had any accidents involving a release of a regulated substance in processes within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSybron Chemicals believes the best way to manage risk is not only to prevent accidents, but also to correctly know what to do if an accident should occur.  After careful consideration of the identified release scenarios, the accident history, and a review of the latest inspection report from the Occupation Safety Health Administration (OSHA), no changes to the current systems are planned.  The Emergency Response Program will continue to reduce the risk through continuous use of safety precautions and instruction manuals that already exist at the facility.  Sybron Chemicals' Process Safety Management Procedures Manual includes such Risk Management components as: process safety information, equipment identification, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, inventory restrictions, process or facility change, and an employee participation plan. The extensive Safety, Emergency and Environmental Procedures Manual includes such Risk Management components as: injury/incident reporting and investigation, hot works permits, line breaking, head/eye/foot protection, respiratory protection, hazard communication plan, forklift safety, waste notification, and plant emergency operations.  In addition, the facility has already incorporated process controls including, relief and check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms, backup pumps, and grounding equipment, where appropriate."

The Wellford Plant is a chemical manufacturing facility, where materials considered hazardous by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency are used, stored, manufactured, and packaged.   \n\nSybron Chemicals uses three regulated chemicals that are above threshold quantities specified in the Risk Management Program regulations.  These chemicals are ethylenediamine, formaldehyde, and trimethlamine, which are chemical additives used in the manufacturing of textiles.  Sybron Chemicals stores ethylenediamine in a storage tank at a 95% administrative capacity limit, which is approximately 71,250 pounds.  Formaldehyde is stored in a storage tank at a 95% administrative volume control, which holds 31,635 pounds.  The regulated trimethylamine is stored in a storage tank at an 80% administrative capacity limit, which holds 51,840 pounds.  Sybron Chemicals adheres to the appropriate government rules and industry guidelines for the storage and use of these flammable substances.\n\nRisk Management Planning\n\nSybron Chemicals has an extensive information sharing practice with its workers and the general public regarding the chemicals used at the facility and their associated risk.  Sybron Chemicals is subject to the Risk Management Program requirement under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act due to its storage and process use of ethylenediamine, formaldehyde, and trimethylamine.  The facility uses both passive measures and active mitigation to minimize the likelihood of releases and their potential impact on the public and on the environment.  \n\nThese mitigation systems include a range of various deterrents to further minimize a release.  The mitigation system for the trimethylamine tank and associated reactor vessel includes:\n-excess flow valves that limit the possibility of excess fluid escaping\n-  a vapor recovery system\n- a venting system through a s"
