      "SummaryText": "I.BACKGROUND\nThe Mt. Poso Cogeneration plant (Mt. Poso) uses anhydrous ammonia to limit nitrous oxides in the stack emissions as required by their APCD operating permit.  Ammonia is a regulated substance under the Clean Air Act (CAA) which requires facilities storing or handling regulated substances in threshold amount s to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and to implement an effective accidental release prevention program.  Mt. Poso has a Risk Management Plan and an accidental release prevention program in place meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions and Title 19, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention program (CalARP).    Ammonia is also a regulated substance under the Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard thus requiring Mt. Poso to comply with Cal-OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. \n\n\nII.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nMt. Poso Cogeneration Company is to conduct business in a manner that is lawful, compatible with the environment and conductive to the health and safety of employees, contractors, facilities and the community.  They will conduct operations in compliance with applicable industry standards, OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs PSM Standard, EPA\u00c2\u00bfs Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, and the California Accidental Release Prevention requirements. \n\nMt. Poso Cogeneration Company will conduct business consistent with the EH&S Policy and the following EH&S Principles:\n\n\u00c2\u00bfActivities will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, industry standards and guidelines.\n\u00c2\u00bfActivities will be managed to protect people and property and to control Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company\u00c2\u00bfs liabilities.\n\u00c2\u00bfAll Mt. Poso Cogeneration Company\u00c2\u00bfs employees will be individually and collectively accountable for the execution of the EH&S Policy.\n\u00c2\u00bfEH&S goals will be achieved through the prudent use of resources, and through communication, education, proactive management, assessment"

Poso has a twelve-year history of operating in compliance with the California Risk Management Prevention Plan (RMPP), California Accidental Release Program (CalARP), and the Cal-OSHA PSM program.  Compliance with these accident prevention programs and the company\u00c2\u00bfs EH&S principles will continue to ensure an incident free operation. \n\n\nIII.FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nMt. Poso operates a nominally rated 49.9 megawatt, coal-fired, circulating fluidized bed, cogeneration facility, in Kern County.  Mt. Poso began operation in 1989.  Mt. Poso operations personnel, under an Operation and Maintenance Agreement, perform the day-to-day operation.  Mt. Poso provides steam for enhanced recovery of crude oil.\n\nAmmonia is used to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions, which improves air quality.  The emissions control operations include storage and handling up to 21,250 gallons of anhydrous ammonia, a substance that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified as an acutely hazardous material.  The USEPA and California have established a program for reducing the hazards associated with the storage and handling of such materials.  The program was initiated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Title III, Section112(r) and codified in 40CFR Part 68.  The California Accidental Release Program (CalARP) pursuant to Sections 25531 through 25543.3 of the Health and Safety Code has additional regulations.  As part of this program, Mt. Poso is required to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and an accidental release prevention program for its anhydrous ammonia storage and handling facilities.\n\nThe maximum capacity of the ammonia storage tank is 25,000 gallons.  Written operating procedures and a high-level alarm prevent more than 21,250 gallons from being present in the 25,000-gallon tank, or 85 percent of maximum capacity.\n\n\nIV.HAZARD REDUCTION\nProcess Hazard Analyses are conducted at the Mt. Poso facility as required by the PSM/RMP regulatio"

      "SummaryText": "ns. The PHA is a systematic review of design, equipment, safeties, and operating procedures and is required every five years.  In April 2008, a PHA revalidation was conducted for the ammonia denox process, using the \u00c2\u00bfChecklist\u00c2\u00bf methodology.  The most likely events, which could lead to potential off-site impacts, are corrosion failure, an external event, and on-site accidents.  The revalidation reviewed recommendations from the previous PHA and determined that all had been resolved.  \n\nEngineering controls and mitigation systems include equipment compatible with anhydrous ammonia, ammonia sensors, relief valves, check valves, manual and automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, emergency air supply, emergency power, and grounding equipment. \n\nAdministrative controls include: health, safety and process training for all employees, contractors and visitors, procedures for different aspects of operation, record keeping, proper installation of equipment, regular inspection, ammonia truck off-loading procedures, storage tank/system operation procedures, ammonia injection procedures, repair and maintenance for all equipment using anhydrous ammonia.  Plant personnel supervise the deliver and off-loading of ammonia.\n\n\nV.ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe PSM/RMP Program has been established by Mt. Poso to protect company and contract personnel, the surrounding community, and property by preventing or minimizing the consequences of catastrophic releases of anhydrous ammonia.  The program complies with both the Federal/State RMP requirements, and Cal-OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (Section 5189 of Title 8 of CCR).  \n\nThe program is a comprehensive management program that integrates engineering controls, administrative procedures, and employee participation into each of the following prevention program elements.   \n1.Employee Participation\n2.Process Safety Information\n3.Process Hazard Analysis\n4.Operating Procedures\n5.Training\n6.Contractors"

Poso has coordinated with the Kern County Fire Department, the local emergency responders.  Mt.
