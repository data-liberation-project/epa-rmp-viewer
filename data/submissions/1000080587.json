In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to reduce the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage,  handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\r\n\r\nOur safety programs reduce accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Bonduelle. - Fairwater consists of three totally independent refrigeration systems.  Engine rooms #1 & 2 are used for the freezing of vegetables.  The main products frozen are green peas and sweet corn.  Engine room # 3 is used to cool the frozen storage warehouse.\r\n\r\nThis facility's general accidental release prevention program and ammonia-specific prevention steps are based on OSHA PSM standard 29 CFR 1910.119 and EPA RM Program regulations in 40 CFR Part 68.  The key prevention step"

Continuing efforts to maintain, inspect and test equipment, along with continual review and revision of operating procedures will allow us to continue our good safety record.\r\n\r\nThis facility's emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the local fire department.  The trained emergency responders receive annual refresher training.  We conduct annual drills for implementaion of the emergency response plan at the facility.\r\n\r\nBonduelle. - Fairwater will continues to review operating procedures and response plans in order to ensure safety at the facility."
