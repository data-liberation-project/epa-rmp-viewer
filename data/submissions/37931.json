If an accidental release should occur,the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department,or other authorities,to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the enviroment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.anhydrous ammonia is received,stored,and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient. Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees,authorized management and authorized contractors.the worst -case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a (storage tank or tank car) released as a gas over 10 minuets.the maximum quanity released would be 120000 pounds, which represents the volume of the (largest storage tank or tank car) as limited by design standards.the distance of the endpoint of .14mg/l for the worst-case scenaro is 1 mile.the alternative release scenario based on the most likely potenttial incident is a release for a break in a transfer hose.the distance to the endpoint of .14mg/l for the alternative scenario is .19 miles thie release has the possibility of extending beyound the facility boundary.this facility complies with epa's accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. This facility has implemented the provisions of safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, k-61.1, published by the american national standards institute, inc.  As adopted by state regulation and the standards of the u. s. occupational safety and health administration(osha) 29 cfr 1910.111, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths;injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,"
