This Plan has been developed as a pro-active environmental directive to support and ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations.  This is an integral part of Interstate Chemical Company, Inc.'s overall corporate objective and supports our commitment to quality and environmental protection at all levels within the company.\n\nThis Plan will increase employee awareness of environmental responsibilities and both strengthen and ensure the trust of the community.  We acknowledge the importance of emergency preparedness, accidental release prevention  and pollution prevention as being fundamental to the protection of our workers, community and environment.  It is the goal of Interstate Chemical Company, Inc. to assure quality and environmental integrity in all aspects of business.  \n\nEmergency response has been incorporated into management procedures and is practiced on a routine basis.  Should response measures become necessary, training has been given in the proper chain of command for notification.  Interstate Chemical Company, Inc. is in direct contact with the Hermitage fire department and is represented in the Mercer County LEPC.  \n\nThe regulated substance handled is;\n7 Hydrofluoric Acid 70% CAS# 7664-39-3\n\nPrimary Activity;\n7 Storage and distribution of 55 gallon drums\n\nUse of regulated substance;\n7 Distribution and storage\n\nQuantities handled/stored;\n7 On site storage consists of 10 - 55 gallon drums\n\nWorst Case Scenario;\n\nHydrofluoric Acid (70%) is brought into this warehouse in 550 # factory pack drums, no repackaging of this product is performed.
