Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSpring Wheat Bakers recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the McDonough facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Vernon Culver, Engineering Manager, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also com"

      "SummaryText": "municated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nSpring Wheat Bakers plant in McDonough is a relatively new facility which started its operations in May 1999.  The company operates an ammonia refrigeration system at this bakery and raw dough manufacturing site to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 28,000 pounds.  Since ammonia releases from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program regulation.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Spring Wheat Inc. facility involves the release of 18,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the high pressure receiver.  This quantity corresponds to 80 percent of the total volume of the high pressure receiver.  It is the maximum allowable quantity which could be present in the receiver based on administrative controls in place at the facility. Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 2.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tThe worst-case weather conditions which were used for this scenario are not typical;\n\t \tUnder normal operating conditions the ammonia inventory in the receiver is considerably lower;\n\t \tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the receiver; \n\t \tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service and the receiver is relat"

The assumed leak size is 1/6 which would provide a liquid release rate of 28 pounds per minute of ammonia. Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in the Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n\t \tIndustry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pumps at the facility;\n\t \tAmmonia is not corrosive in this service and the pump is relatively new;\n\t \tThe facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the pumps; \n\t \tThe facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate potential releases from any leaking equipment.\n\n\nD.
