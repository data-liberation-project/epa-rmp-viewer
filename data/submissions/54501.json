The Company endeavors to execute this policy through the daily implementation of its Safety Programs. Company safety program includes, but is not limited to a comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM), which is executed through Western Precooling Systems (WPS); which owns the OBC facility. The PSM Program is an integrated approach to the safe operation of processes using Regulated Substances. The PSM Program is specifically designed and intended to prevent accidental releases, and to deal safely with emergencies if and when they do happen. It is the primary goal of OBC to protect its employees, visitors and neighbors from harm due to Company operations.  Refrigeration Technicians employed by WPS are trained for their Response Action.\n\nThe Company recognizes the need to be prepared to respond safely to accidental releases that could occur should established prevention programs fail. Ocean Breeze Cooling policy includes development, maintenance and implementation of its Emergency Action Plan, and to train its employees in notification and evacuation procedures. WPS policy includes maintaining appropriate emergency response capabilities and to deal with emergencies safely if and when they do happen.

Emergency response pre-planning has been coordinated through the Local Emergency Planning Committee (CUPA in California), including the submission of appropriate EPCRA Inventory Reports. Each company strives to execute its emergency response policies through skilled employees that are provided with adequate and appropriate equipment and training.\n\n1.2  General Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nOcean Breeze Cooling is a facility located in Oxnard, CA in a commercial/industrial area of the city. The facility was built in the early 1980?s according to locally adopted codes in effect at that time. Improvements over the years have been made according to codes in effect at the time. Ocean Breeze Cooling is 100% owned by Western Precooling Systems but operations are separated: \n\n?    Ocean Breeze Cooling manages pre-cooling, refrigerated storage and shipping of fresh produce.\n?    Western Precooling Systems maintains the refrigeration system.\n\nThe facility provides refrigeration effect for the removal of field heat from freshly harvested vegetables and fruit (primarily strawberries). The product that comes to the facility for pre-cooling and short-term storage is on site generally for four days from harvesting. The facility is a seasonally operated plant with product harvest periods picking up in the month of October and finishing in July. The remaining months see little fresh product, however the refrigeration equipment is still operative. Annual maintenance is performed on the equipment during August and September.\n\nThe refrigerant in use is Anhydrous Ammonia, CAS #7664-41-7, which is used in a closed-loop mechanical refrigeration system. Pressure and temperature controls are installed in accordance with appropriate standards, including isolation and overpressure relief valves. Refrigeration equipmen"

Vacuum Tubes, Refrigeration Trailers (Compressor Units), Pressure Cooling Units, Cold Storage Room Evaporators and associated valves, instrumentation and piping.\n   \n1.3  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nWPS is the company that operates and maintains the ammonia refrigeration equipment at the site. WPS has developed comprehensive written procedures for the operation and maintenance of ammonia-handling equipment, including the steps to be taken in the event of a release or threatened release. The written procedures include necessary safety precautions for Plant operation, from installation and start-up to daily operation, to teardown and removal of portable equipment. As equipment maintenance needs are determined, the need is expressed at the workload meetings conducted by the WPS Area Manager. The specific repair task or upgrade for the expressed need is decided by the WPS Area Manager and entered into the Service Call system. Tasks are tracked through the Service Call system. Through this regular routine of inspect, discuss, assign and confirmation of completion, Ocean Breeze Cooling and WPS have reduced equipment operational problems and also reduced the release potential.\n\nWPS actively encourages its ammonia technicians to seek Certification through the Refrigerating Engineers and Technicians Association (RETA).    \n\nA comprehensive Process Safety Management Program (PSM) has been established for the site, in accordance with CCR 8, 5189. The PSM Program is specifically intended to promote the safe operation of ammonia-handling equipment and processes. PSM is an integral part of daily Plant operation. The written PSM document is maintained online by OBC.\n\nChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIt has become apparent in the industry that a mishap while draining oil from the system is one of the most common incidents to occur.

If a release were to develop during the oil-draining task, the mechanic simply releases the handle of the self-closing valve and flow is terminated.  WPS has installed these types of valves at the oil drain points.\n\nIn 1996 and 1997 modifications were made to the piping system that gave more support to the piping in the event of seismic activity. At the same time WPS decided to reduce its offsite consequence potential by piping all High Side relief valves to water absorbing tanks (dispersion/diffusion). High Side relief valve excursions were identified as the most common unwanted release situation and by routing to a secondary containment system the effects of a relief situation no longer affected people on or off-site.  \n\nOther release prevention steps taken at OBC:\n\n?    The facility is enclosed with fencing and gates to limit access to the facility to increase the security of the facility from potential ?wrong-do-er?s?.\n?    Employees are trained for hazard communication (discovery and communicating) for releases, fires, vandal?s etc. Training is documented through an Online Training System (WBBM) and the ?Personal Qualifications Standard? booklet, which is in each employees training record file.\n?    A strong relationship exists with the Oxnard Fire Department. There have been demonstrations and tours of the system with the first responding engine companies to familiarize the crews with the facility layout and where hazardous areas are located.\n?    The compressor area is microprocessor controlled with internet access for computer monitoring and parameter changes. The equipment may be shutdown from off site via phone if it were not possible to directly access the control area.\n?    There is an automatic texting function that is connected to the computer control.  When there is an equipment failure, or when the pressures are rising and approaching the shutdown setting, or if there is a power failure, this text alert to the techni"

Major maintenance and equipment upgrades were implemented in 2008-2009.\n\n1.4  Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn June, 2006 a 480 lb release from an evaporative condenser was reported to the NRC, OES, CUPA. The evaporative condenser was replaced in August, 2006.  This reportable release did not result in any on or offsite consequences as defined by the RMP rule.  \n\n \n1.5  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Emergency Response Program is divided into two elements, as only properly trained and qualified personnel are authorized to respond to emergencies. Personnel that are not involved in the actual cooling process are trained to detect, notify and evacuate. Only personnel trained to 29 CFR 1910.120(q) standards and the Oxnard Fire Department would respond to an actual release. Available Emergency Response equipment includes personal ammonia electronic monitors as well as other emergency gear (the equipment is under the control of WPS). Written ammonia emergency response procedures are detailed in the facility?s ?Thirty Minute Plan?. The ?Consolidated Contingency Plan? and the ?Emergency Action Plan? detail procedures for non-responding personnel. Each of these Plans are maintained on-site and updated on a regular basis.\n  \n1.6   Planned changes to improve safety\n\nThe primary mechanisms to identify and plan safety improvements include (but are not limited to):\n?    Process Hazard Analysis revalidation/update;\n?    Compliance Audits;\n?    Routine maintenance (Mechanical Integrity Program);\n?    IIAR Bulletin 109 Inspections;\n?
