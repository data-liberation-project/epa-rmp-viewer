Aqua Ammonia is received, stored and distributed to area farms as a source of land applied nitrogen fertilizer.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Program\n\n         \n\nThis aqua ammonia facility implemented the provisions of various anhydrous ammonia rules as they relate to aqua ammonia such as: \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1); standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\"; and standards of CalOSHA, 8 CCR 500-515, \"Unfired Pressure Vessel Safety Orders - Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Also referenced is \"Standards for Storage and Handling of Nitrogen Fertilizer Solutions Containing more than 1% Free Ammonia\" by the National Fertilizer Solutions Association, Peoria IL, 1974.    \n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nIn the past five years there have been no accidental releases at this site. \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed a written emergency contingency plan (Integrated Contingency Plan). The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans as mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR - 1910.38, 1910.119, and 1910.120, EPA 40 CFR - part 264 subpart D, part 265 subpart D, part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA-FRP - 49 CFR part 194; and, California Heath and Safety Code Section 25503 of Division 6.95.  Elements within this plan include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and community right to know, pre-emergency planning, and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety and Environmental programs are very dynamic, since this is an ongoing process, changes toward improvement are evaluated and implemented periodically. The need for improvement is identified by facility employee inputs, inspections and audits which are performed regularly at this facility."
