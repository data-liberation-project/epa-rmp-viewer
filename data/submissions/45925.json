      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n1.1 Introduction \nCalpine Corporation operates the Los Medanos Energy Center (LMEC), a nominal 500 megawatt power plant located in Pittsburg, California. The Los Medanos Energy Center uses aqueous ammonia (24.5 percent solution) as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere. Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. As the company responsible for operating Los Medanos Energy Center, Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\n1.2 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Los Medanos Energy Center accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n  \nCalpine Corporation recognizes the responsibility to make our environment, community and employee safety a primary part of our daily concerns. Calpine Corporation is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.

The environmental, health and safety program at LMEC includes this CalARP RMP and the aqueous ammonia system manual.\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment. Los Medanos Energy Center has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\n1.3 Facility Description and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Los Medanos Energy Center is located approximately 0.5 miles northeast of Pittsburg, California in Contra Costa County.  LMEC is situated on a 12-acre site at East 3rd Street, east of the intersection of East 3rd and Harbor. The facility sits on the northwest corner of property owned by USS-POSCO Industries. The plant is a merchant facility marketing electrical power on the open power exchange market and ancillary service support to the California Independent Systems Operator (CAL-ISO) grid. Lines owned by Pacific Gas and Electric transport electricity generated by this facility.  LMEC will provide steam and electricity to USS-POSCO and backup steam to Dow Chemical. \n\nThe facility currently stores aqueous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in two 10,000 gallon steel bulk storage tanks.  Ammonia is used at the Los Medanos Energy Center to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhaust from the two Combustion "

Ammonia is pumped from a storage tank, diluted with exhaust gases, and injected into the two HRSG Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions. The Auxiliary Boiler utilizes air blowers for dilution and injection of the ammonia into the boiler?s injection grid. Figure 1-1 shows a diagram of the aqueous ammonia process.\n\nAs indicated in the table below, the Los Medanos Energy Center stores and handles a maximum of approximately 129,000 lbs (17,000 gallons) of aqueous ammonia at a concentration of 24.5 percent. This exceeds the EPA RMP and CalARP thresholds of 20,000 pounds for concentrations greater than 20 percent based on the pounds of ammonia in solution (e.g., 31,612 pounds) using the following equation:\n17,000 gallons x 7.59 pounds/gallon x 24.5 percent solution\n= 31,612 pounds of aqueous ammonia\n\nTherefore this process is subject to CalARP and federal RMP regulations. Aqueous ammonia is used for selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the exhaust of Heat Recovery Steam Generators and Auxiliary Boiler at the Los Medanos Energy Center. Because it is not part of the NAICS codes listed by USEPA in 68.10(d), it is not subject to CalOSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (due to its concentration being less than 44 percent) and there are public receptors in the toxic endpoint zone for the worst-case release scenario for aqueous ammonia, the aqueous ammonia process falls into CalARP Program 2.\n\nHydrogen is also stored onsite, however the maximum quantity is well below the CalARP/RMP thresholds and is, therefore not subject to CalARP/RMP requirements.\n\n1.4 Offsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as ?worst case? and ?alternative? release scenarios.

The worst-case release scenario for Los Medanos Energy Center is the rupture of an ammonia bulk storage tank, resulting in a release of 64,515 pounds of aqueous ammonia solution into the secondary containment area and the subsequent evaporation over a 10-minute duration.  In practice, this type of total release of a bulk tank would be unlikely to occur during the lifetime of the plant. The passive mitigation provided by the containment area was considered for both the worst-case and alternative release scenariosfor ammonia.  The storage tanks and associated piping are all outside; therefore no building mitigation was considered. \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis for aqueous ammonia was conducted using Equation (2) on page 4-13 and 4-14 and the equation on page 4-63 of the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (EPA 550 B 98-010, October 27, 1998). The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. The toxic endpoint selected by EPA was 198 ppm. All required EPA-model input parameters were included in completing this activity, including conservative meteorological conditions ? Stability F class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, highest daily maximum temperature (109 degrees F), and 50 percent humidity (per EPA guidelines). \n\nThe results of the dispersion modeling analysis for this worst-case release scenario indicate that the distance to the toxic endpoint is 970 feet.

Active mitigation consists of mechanical, electrical, or human input. CalARP also requires that the selected alternative release scenario be calculated such that it will reach a toxic endpoint offsite, unless no such scenario exists. Contra Costa County Health Services Department (CCCHSD) requires that the worst credible release modeled with conservative meteorological conditions be used for the alternative release scenario.\nThree release scenarios considered in the hazard review were ranked moderate in severity and possible in likelihood: the delivery truck rolls during unloading and piping is damaged, a pipe leak and a gasket leak.   Because a release in the unloading area would drain to the underground containment vault, the worst credible release selected for the Los Medanos Energy Center assumes a spill of 300 gallons of aqueous ammonia from a pipe on the discharge side of the ammonia supply pumps. This scenario would result in a released quantity that would cover the containment area to a depth of at least 1 cm.  Thus, the rate of the ammonia release rate for this scenario was calculated to be 44.02 lbs/min. This is a conservative scenario (assumes more ammonia is released) because one ammonia supply pump would only discharge 2.8 gallons a minute.  This is unlikely to happen as the control room would receive a low-pressure alarm and the ammonia supply pump would be shut off within a few minutes.  \nThe modeling approach used was similar to the worst-case release scenario, the calculations assumed Stability F Class, wind speed of 1.5 meters per second, average air temperature of 77 degrees F, and a humidity of 50 percent.\n\nThe results of the dispersion modeling analysis for the alternative release scenario indicate that this scenario has a smaller offsite impact.

The primary codes and standards that were used for the ammonia system are provided in Table 1-2.\n\n1.5.5 Hazard Review \n\nThe intent of the hazard review is to provide information that will assist Los Medanos Energy Center staff in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of hazardous accidental releases.  A hazard review is a systematic effort to evaluate potential causes and consequences of accidental releases.  The hazard review focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human factors, and external events, including seismic events that might affect the process.  \nSeveral methodologies can be used to perform a Hazard Review or a Process Hazard Analysis as described in Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures, Second Edition with Worked Examples, Center for Chemical Process Safety of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, 1992. For less complex systems, the What-if Analysis/Checklist method is commonly used. The What-If Analysis is a brainstorming approach in which the Hazard Review team identifies potential accidental release scenarios and recommendations for risk reduction.   The Checklist method uses industry checklists or checklists developed by staff familiar with the process. \nWith the concurrence of the Contra Costa County Health Services Department, the What-If Analysis/Checklist method was selected for evaluating potential accidental releases at Los Medanos Energy Center.   Calpine Corporation believes this approach provides the most detailed and applicable level of analysis, incorporating both general industry information and plant-specific kn"

For each potential accidental release scenario identified by the Hazard Review team, onsite and offsite consequences were determined using a risk-ranking matrix.  This matrix provides a qualitative evaluation of risk based on the likelihood and severity of each potential accidental release scenario. Risk was evaluated assuming that existing accidental release controls and safeguards fail.  \n\nThe Hazard Review team brainstormed recommendations to reduce the risk of accidental aqueous ammonia releases for each significant release scenario.  Significant release scenarios were defined as any accidental release that would probably occur during the lifetime of LMEC and could result in an onsite injury requiring medical treatment, or any offsite injury or death.\nIn support of the evaluation of seismic events, Calpine Corporation also conducted a seismic assessment of the ammonia process.  The purpose of the assessment is to provide reasonable assurance that a release of regulated substances having offsite consequences would not occur as a result of an earthquake. This seismic assessment was conducted in accordance with the provisions of Contra Costa County CalARP Program Guidance Document (June 1998) and Guidance for California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program Seismic Assessments (September 1998). The seismic assessment was conducted by a registered structural engineer with over 15 years of experience and included the following activities:\n\n? Determining the seismic hazards.
