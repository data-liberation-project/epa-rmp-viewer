      "SummaryText": "This facility follows MSHA Standards, OSHA standards, ASTM Standards, ANSI Standards, and ASME Standards pertaining to the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia.  In May of 2009 the site Emergency Response Plan was completely revised including provisions for anhydrous ammonia release scenarios.  Emergency response training in the form of site evacuation drills are conducted routinely and site environmental and safety personnel are fully aware of the hazards and responses necessary should an anhydrous ammonia release occur.  With the revision of the Emergency response plan in May of 2009, site emergency response personnel were familiarized with changes to the plans and site safety training includes emergency response provisions relating to site emergencies, including anhydrous ammonia.   It is our policy and practice to utilize the facilities own response team to respond to onsite emergencies and to notify the Blanding Fire Department to enlist their assistance, as necessary.\n\nThe facility utilizes two 140,000 lb tanks for storage of anhydrous ammonia.  This reagent is used in the uranium extraction process.  The ammonia tanks are inspected on a daily basis, including exterior tankage and piping.  There has never been an accident at the facility involving anhydrous ammonia that caused deaths, injuries, environmental damage, property damage, or evacuations."
