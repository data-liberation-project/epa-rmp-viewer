      "SummaryText": "A.  Describe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nMeadow Gold Dairies recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, equipment, property and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the protection of the environment are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the facility.\n\nThe Company has a Plant Safety Program.  The primary objective of the Plant Safety Program are to achieve maximum efficiency and safety performance.\n\nTo accomplish the Company's goal in preventing the accidental releases of ammonia and minimizing the impact of any release, the facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management and Risk Management program to comply with OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119) and EPAs Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Emergency Response programs have been reviewed as well.  The objectives of the PSM/RMP programs are to prevent accidental releases through use of good operating procedures and mechanical intregrity of the ammonia refrigeration system.  The Plant Manager is responsible for the management of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs.\n\nB.  Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nMeadow Gold Dairies operates a milk processing facility where milk products, juice, juice drinks, and cottage cheese are processed, packaged, sold and distributed from this facility.  Ice cream is also stored, sold and distributed.  An important part of the processing and handling involves an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling during processing and storage at the facility.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop system whereby liquid ammonia from the high pressure receiver located outsid"

      "SummaryText": "e the building is piped in special piping to refrigeration equipment used for cooling or freezing.  During cooling or freezing, the pressure of the ammonia is reduced so that the ammonia can take away heat from the milk products being cooled or stored.  The ammonia returns to the engine room in larger special piping in vapor form at low pressure to the booster or high side compressors where the vapors are compressed and piped to the condensers located outside.  Forced air and recirculated water cool and condense the vapors in the lines.  From the condensers, the ammonia flows by gravity back to the high pressure receiver, completing the loop.  Ammonia is a non-corrosive chemical; therefore, does not deteriorate the inside of vessels, lines or valves.  It also carries a small amount of oil from the compessors.  All vessels containing ammonia are ASME pressure rated above the maximum operating pressure.\n\nC.  Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe program consists of the following elemenets:\n\na.  Employee Participation:  Maintenance employees participated in developing the Process Hazard Analysis (PHAs), Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and other elements of the program.\nb.  Process Safety Information:  Piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) have been developed where all ammonia vessels, lines and valves are numbered on the drawings.  All ammonia valves (except small guage valves) are numbered.  Information has been collected  which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system.  The written information includes the ammonia MSDS.\nc:  Process Hazard Analysis:  Studies were conducted with maintenance personnel using the What-if/Check list technique to look at the system and identify potential hazards.\nd.  Operating Procedures:  Written procedures have been developed with describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\ne.  Training:  A training program h"

Contractors:  Contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform  work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.\ng.  Pre-Startup Safety Review:  A pre-startup safety review will be completed for all new ammonia projects involving a change to the system to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, operating procedures developed, P&IDs developed, PHAs completed, and construction has been completed according to the design specifications.\nh.  Mechanical integrity:  Annual inspections of the ammonia refrigeration system including lines and valves by a team of management and hourly personnel.  Any recommendations are resolved promptly.\ni.  Hot Work Permits:  Procedures to be followed to ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning in any area other than one designed as hot work.\nj.  Management of Change:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\nk.  Incident Investigation:  The procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\nl.  Compliance Audits:  Audits will be conducted every three years to ascertain whether or not the program is in place and working properly.\n\nD.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nNo ammonia-related incidents were identified for the facility in the previous five years which resulted in significant on-site or off-site consequences.\n\nE.  Description of the Emergency Action Plan\n\nAn emergency action plan has been implemented at the facility.  This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures.  The program has been coordinated with the Lincoln Fire Department.\n\nTh"
