Pelham Junction includes nine (9) large aboveground storage tanks containing various grades of gasoline and other petroleum products. Petroleum is received and distributed by pipeline. The Facility also includes a butane operation in which butane is received by trucks, stored on-site in a horizontal, pressurized vessel, and blended into gasoline. This Risk Management Plan (RMP) covers the butane operations conducted at the Facility, identified in this document as the \u0093Butane Blending Process\u0094. The Butane Blending Process has been designated Program Level 3 under the RMP rule.\n\nThe Butane Blending Process was constructed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association Code #58 - The Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code (NFPA 58) and CPC intends to follow the most current future editions to the extent feasible and adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and Local codes/laws. If an emergency were to occur, it is Pelham Junction's policy to contact the Pelham Fire Department and the Shelby County LEPC, as appropriate, through the 911 Service and request their assistance. Pelham Junction maintenance a written Emergency Response Action Plan and ensures that it is coordinated with the local response agencies annually at minimum.  The Pelham Fire Department is aware of the Butane Blending Process, its safety systems, access points, and protective procedures in the event of a significant release.  The Terminal is fully secured with fencing and controlled access in accordance with its site security plan. In addition, Pelham Junction currently maintains a trained incipient stage fire response and first responder-operations level hazardous materials response team to respond to the initial stages of an emergency.\n\nThe Pelham Junction Butane Blending Process complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Accident Prevention Rules (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D-"

The Facility completes regular compliance audits to ensure that policies are being implemented properly and revalidates its process hazard analysis every 5 years. In addition CPC actively seeks employee input on process safety improvements."
