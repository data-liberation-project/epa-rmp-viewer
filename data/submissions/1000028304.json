      "SummaryText": "m, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and assure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nCHS Inc. primarily uses the What If analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The What If technique asks a series of questions to review potential hazard scenarios and possible consequences.  This analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the underground storage as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to the Process Hazard Coordinator for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps assure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo help assure that process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, CHS Inc. periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures (CHS Inc.: Doc 8505)\r\nThe CHS Conway Terminal maintains written procedures that address operations needed for the storage and transfer of refinery products.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These proc"

The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nTraining (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc. 8506)\r\nTo complement the written procedures for underground storage operations, the CHS Conway Terminal has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees operating underground storage equipment. New employees receive basic training in underground operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests and skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. \r\nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to assure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors (CHS Inc.: PSM, Doc. 8507)\r\nThe CHS Conway Terminal uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near underground storage equipment, procedures are in place to assure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner, have the appropriate knowledge and skills, are aware of the hazards in their workplace, understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, understand and follow site safety rules and, and inform CHS Conway Terminal personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work"
