The impact from this scenario is no more than 0.02 miles.  There are no residential, public or environmental receptors within this impact radius. \n\nFrom 2006 through 2008, Building 7, a warehouse building, underwent a series of major upgrades to enable it to be reclassified as an Aerosol Storage Warehouse.
