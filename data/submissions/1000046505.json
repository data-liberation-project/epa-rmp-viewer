All new employees are provided training on the following topics, at a minimum:  the requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, hazardous chemicals used in the plant, how to read and get information from Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), hazards associated with each treatment process, operation, testing and routine maintenance of safety systems used in processes involving highly hazardous chemicals, use of personal protective equipment, emergency procedures, understanding process safety management, and the location of SDSs, the Process Safety Management Plan (PSMP) for the facility, and other safety information.  Employee training for highly hazardous chemicals is provided for all employees at the time of their initial assignment to the facility or to a specific process and any time a new chemical or process is introduced in the plant.  In addition, once every three years and more often if necessary, the City must provide each employee with a refresher training course covering these topics.  Further training is also provided on various topics related to the facility and its processes once per week.  \n\n\n\nThe City of Cayce Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant - E. H.
