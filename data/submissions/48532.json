These Regulations deal with the risk involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals. In complying this way, we promote overall facility, employee, and public safety. Patrick Cudahy's program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence of, and minimize the consequences of, significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs are in place to prevent the potential for accidental injury, illness, death, and to avoid the potential for property and environmental damage. \n\nPatrick Cudahy's safety programs are applied to all activities involving hazardous chemicals including use, storage, handling, or the on-site movement of chemicals. Any group of vessels interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process. \n\nPatrick Cudahy's safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and best practices that govern processes, activities, and or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and revised as necessary. All information is communicated to employees of Patrick Cudahy Inc. through training and documentation.\n\nPatrick Cudahy Inc. is a processing and packaging company that utilizes approximately 180,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia in its refrigeration system to cool the facility's production and shipping area's.\n\nIn a Worst Case Scenario, failure of the hig"
