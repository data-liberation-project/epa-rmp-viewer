Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Falcon Safety Products are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the manufacture of a variety of aerosol products. We have 2 regulated substances at our facility.  The first is Difluoroethane (Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-) which is used in our aerosol filling process as a propellant for the manufacture of compressed gas dusters and horns.  The other is Isobutane which is used on our filling process as a propellant for the manufacture of compressed gas horns.\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58, NFPA 30B, NFPA 13 standards.    The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFalcon Safety Products maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is H"

The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/19/15\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Falcon Safety Products  maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nFalcon Safety Products has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFalcon Safety Products carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Falcon Safety Products to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Falcon Safety Products .  The most recent review was performed on 07/11/2019.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nFalcon Safety Products conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 11/30/2018.  These audits are carried out at least anually and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFalcon Safety Products promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nFalcon Safety Products truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors "

Additional emergency shutdown stations have been added to expedite shutdown of the system in the event of emergency.  Continual modification of existing product equipment such as heat tunnel elevation, protective cages, additional guards, etc. have been implemented to reduce the possibility of injury.  Additional e-stops have also been added outside the aerosol fillers to allow exterior shutdown.  Using desktop scenarios, we continue to find the opportunity for improvements within the facility.\n\n\n\nA camera surveillance system has also been added to the facility to provide additional security and safety of the employees and facility. Security and first aid drills will also be added to the evacuation plan.\n\n\n\nWith the addition of a 10,000 gallon tank we have implemented a modification to the existing deluge system to include coverage for the new tank and have upgraded all piping and sprinkler heads.  Existing facility sprinkler system has also been upgraded according to NFPA recommendations which protects all interior sections of the building.
