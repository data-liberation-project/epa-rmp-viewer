The Low Temperature Accumulator also collects the liquid/vapor mixture produced by these evaporators; the vapor returned is then drawn to the compressors.\r\n\r\nThe evaporators maintain the appropriate room temperatures by transferring heat from the air in the room to the ammonia inside the coils, using fans to move air across the coils. The result is (partially) vaporized ammonia that is returned to both the High Temperature and Low Temperature Accumulator vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Glycol Heat Exchanger transfers heat from the ammonia vapor to the glycol solution, which heats the glycol solution. The glycol is used for under floor heating in a separate closed system.\r\n\r\nThe compressors (RC1 thru RC4) draw the suction return vapor that is collected in the High Temperature and Low Temperature Accumulator vessels and compresses it to discharge high pressure vapor (hot gas). The compressors are the primary energy input into the system. Hot gas is used internally within the system to assist with defrosting the evaporator coils based on a timed cycle. The main high stage discharge flow is routed to the Condensers, which discharge the latent heat in the ammonia to the atmosphere using sprayed water and fans, resulting in high pressure liquid ammonia. This liquid is recycled into the High Pressure Receiver vessel.\r\n\r\nThe system also incorporates an automatic purger. Ammonia in the system is automatically purged of any non-condensables, i.e., air and water vapor. Non-condensables are purged from the condensers and the High Pressure Receiver.

The facility has also installed ammonia sensors in the Engine Room, in the cold storage areas which will alert operators in the event of an ammonia detection. \r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nThere have been no federally reportable incidents nor any that resulted in serious injuries or offsite consequences within the last five years (April 2014 - April 2019). \r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan (plan) in effect at the facility.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives: \r\n \r\n- save lives;\r\n- minimize and avoid injuries;\r\n- protect the environment; and\r\n- minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe Plan provides the notification procedures and evacuation routes for emergencies that may arise at the facility. The Facility is non-responding and has personnel trained to support the HazMat response team if required (up to 300 ppm of ammonia).\r\n\r\nThere is a specific program (CEHS-0042) which outlines the training, qualifications and procedures for authorized ammonia Incident responders and observers.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.  Facility personnel receive annual training regarding the emergency procedures and the Emergency Response Team holds regular drills.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\n\r\nIn 1996, the refrigeration system was thoroughly examined for safety hazards by way of a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  In addition, five Revalidations of the initial Process Hazard Analysis have been conducted.  \r\n\r\n\u00bf\t1st Revalidation: 1999 \r\n\u00bf\t2nd Revalidation: 2004\r\n\u00bf\t3rd Revalidation: 2009\r\n\u00bf\t4th Revalidation: August 2010\r\n\u00bf\t5th Revalidation: August 2015\r\n\r\nThe PHA Revalidations consisted of a:\r\n\r\n- Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study\r\n\r\n- What-If"

The Corporate Compliance Team administers the facility's safety and environmental policies.  The Corporate Compliance Team periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure compliance, and oversees implementation of the safety and environmental programs.  These programs include forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Response, as well as the Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nDubois Logistics is located at 851 Beaver Road in Dubois, PA.  The primary business of Dubois Logistics is to provide refrigerated warehousing and storage for various food products.  In order to conduct operations, the facility maintains a refrigeration system containing approximately 16,274 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  The refrigeration system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, and then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for glycol chilling, dock operations, cold/freezer storage, and ice making.  Typical operating conditions range from 2 Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 165 psig on the high side of the system.  \r\n\r\nOff-site Release Scenarios\r\nC&S has conducted an OCA based on the EPA document titled RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidelines, and used the EPA's RMP*Comp Version 1.07 to estimate the distance traveled to a toxic endpoint defined by the EPA regulation. This data were then used to es"

The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Dubois Logistics to prevent the accidental release of ammonia from the facility.  The Operating Procedures program ensures that the ammonia system is operated in a safe manner.  The Training program ensures that personnel fully understand how to perform their jobs in a safe manner.  The Mechanical Integrity program ensures that the ammonia system is in proper working condition based upon routine testing, inspections, and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications and industry standards.  The Management of Change program ensures that process modifications are implemented in a safe manner.  The Pre-Startup Safety Review program ensures that adequate safety measures are in place before ammonia is introduced into a process.  The Hot Work Permit program ensures that Dubois Logistics' employees and contractors perform hot work (e.g. welding) in a safe manner.  The Contractor Safety program ensures that contractors understand the hazards of ammonia and must take specified precautions to safely complete job requirements.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the refrigeration system has been designed with several safety features to prevent the accidental release of ammonia.  For example, the compressors are equipped with safety mechanisms that will cause the units to shut down if operating conditions exceed design"

Although these scenarios are highly unlikely in the event of a release, it provides the local responding agencies with a maximum possible impact in the event of an accidental release. In considering these releases, the most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used. Passive mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios\r\nAlternative scenarios were developed to assess what potential impact may occur in the event of a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenarios for each of the regulated chemicals. Several possible release scenarios were considered, and the scenarios with the greatest offsite impact were chosen. In considering the alternative release scenario, the default meteorological conditions for alternative scenarios were used in RMP*Comp. These scenarios represent a more realistic release, and have a downwind distance and impact considerably smaller than the worst-case scenario. No passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account when considering these release scenarios.\r\n\r\nProcess Description\r\n\r\nThe High Pressure Receiver is a horizontal vessel that maintains a reservoir of liquid ammonia that is supplied by liquid injection to cool the compressor lubrication oil. The liquid is pumped to the compressors, where the heat from the oil partially boils the ammonia and causes the vapor to return to the High Pressure Receiver.
