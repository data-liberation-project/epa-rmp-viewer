Airgas' Process Safety and Risk Management Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee participation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nPropane and Propylene are the regulated substances that are managed at the Airgas - Mid America fill plant in Poca, WV.   Airgas - Mid America trucks pick up returned (empty) propane and propylene cylinders from customer locations and transport the returned cylinders to the stationary source.  Propane is stored at the stationary source in four small, interconnected bulk tanks.  Propylene is stored at the stationary source in a large bulk tank.  Propane and Propylene are transferred from the bulk tanks into propane and propylene cylinders, respectively.  The full propane and propylene cylinders are distributed by Airgas - Mid America to customers.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the stationary source are located in the Volume 2 Process Safety and Risk Management Manual.
