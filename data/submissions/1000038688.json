      "SummaryText": "The City of Oakdale Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 1724 Highway 10 East, Oakdale, Louisiana.  Chlorine is used to chlorinate the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant.  On average, 6000 pounds of chlorine are stored in one ton cylinders.  The maximum stored on site is 10,000 pounds.  In case of a leak, the City of Oakdale has an emergency policy which requires City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 Center.  Local police and fire departments are notified.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in evacuating citizens in the affected areas.\n\nCurrently, the City uses daily inspections and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is operating properly.  There are no active or passive mitigation being used at the facility at the present time.  Plant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine stored in one ton cylinders.  Formal and on-the-job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination system.\n\nThe City of Oakdale has no history of reportable releases for chlorine at this site.  There has been no injury or property loss associated with this chemical.  The City of Oakdale site is included in the written community emergency response plan.  The facility does not have its own written emergency plan.  The facility notifies 911 Center which contacts the State HazMat, local fire, and police departments for assistance.\n"
