      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 40 CFR 68 \n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n\n\n\nCabot Corporation (Cabot) owns and operates a carbon black research, development, and manufacturing facility, called the Cabot Pampa Development and Manufacturing Center (also known as \"PDMC\") located in Pampa, Gray County, Texas. Ethylene (CAS# 74-85-1) is the only RMP chemical stored on-site with the storage quantity greater than 10,000 lbs. Ethylene will arrive the site in tube trailers in the week of January 11, 2021. Ethylene will be consumed during the month. Partially- or fully-empty trailers will leave the site by February 8, 2021. Therefore, the ethylene will be on-site for less than 30 days and may be brought on-site in future for short durations. \n\n\n\nPer RMP guidance, changes to the process that make the site no longer subject to Part 68 requirements must de-register the RMP within 6 months of making the change. Since the timing of future use of ethylene at the site cannot be forecasted accurately at this time, Cabot is using the Predictive Filing option rather than de-registering after the current use and re-registering again. Cabot will evaluate offsite consequence analysis if the quantity of ethylene is higher than the currently represented values or if there are changes to release scenarios and re-submit RMP, as necessary.\n\n\n\nEthylene will be stored as unliquified compressed gas in DOT-Approved Tube Trailers. Pressure will be less than 1500 psig and temperature will be ambient. The ethylene is not refrigerated or liquefied.\n\n\n\nWorst-case Release: The worst-case release scenario is modeled as the release of ethylene\n\nfrom one ethylene tube stored at the trailer. The release quantity is 860 kg (1,900 lbs). The worst-case release scenario is characterized as a vapor cloud explosion. At the flammable vapor cloud explosion endpoint of one (1) pound per square inch (psi) overpressure, this flammable release yielded an overpressure endpoint distance of 0.1 miles, as calculated using RMP*Comp. \n\n\n\nAlterna"

      "SummaryText": "tive Scenario #1: Release of Ethylene Through Vent Valve Left Open\n\nCabot's procedure for ethylene use requires purging of lines with nitrogen (N2) before and after a line break or trailer connection/disconnection. It also requires purging with N2 before normal service. Purging of some parts of the line is manual, and small (1/4-inch nominal) vent valves are used to vent the purged gas. It is physically possible to accidentally leave one of these vent valves open when ethylene service is started. Doing this would cause a release at the following conditions:\n\n\n\n?    1500 psig ethylene (maximum) vented through an opening of 0.25 inches.\n\n\n\nAs one layer of protection against this event, Cabot PDMC monitors vent flows with a flow switch. This device notifies operators that a vent valve has been left open, and will eventually close off ethylene flow if these are not closed. It is estimated that the leak could persist for 5 minutes before being closed off.\n\n\n\nA leak of 5 minutes at this condition, through an open ?-inch vent valve at choked flow, would release ethylene at a maximum rate of 0.77 kg/s (100 lb/min). This ethylene would not ignite, as it would be released to a safe area far from ignition sources, through the vent system. This scenario is characterized as a vapor cloud explosion.\n\n\n\nAlternative Scenario #2: Process Vessel Seal Failure\n\nWhile Cabot PDMC will hydrotest or pressure-test, as well as leak-test, the ethylene service, it is possible that a fitting may leak after connection to the trailer for some time.\n\n\n\nCabot PDMC estimates that a leak may be undetected for 3 hours, which is roughly the frequency with which the plant staff will patrol/check the line. A fitting leak can be modeled by assuming a 0.03-inch hole in a pipe exposed to the maximum pressure (i.e., 1500 psig). The release scenario is therefore:\n\n\n\n?    1500 psig ethylene (maximum) vented through an opening of 0.03 inches for 3 hours\n\n\n\nThe estimated release of ethylene will be at a rate of 0.012 "

Within this zone all possible ignition sources are prohibited, as is vehicle travel. Any instruments will be explosion-proofed (Class 1 Div 2) following NFPA 55 and FM Global guidelines. This scenario is characterized as a vapor cloud explosion. \n\n\n\nThe facility has taken the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR Part 68. Employees are trained to recognize the hazards of the process and all changes to the process are reviewed to ensure that the safety, health, and environmental consequences of the change are addressed prior to the implementation of the change. The facility is also subject to OSHA's PSM rule. No reportable accidental release has occurred in the past five years since this is the initial RMP submittal.\n\n"
