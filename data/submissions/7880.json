The American Pride Coop Policy\n\nThe management and employees of American Pride Coop, Henderson facility is committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release would occur, the American Pride Coop has in place a memorandum of understanding with the Brighton fire department.  This agreement calls for a joint response and mitigation of any release thus minimizing the impact of a release to the community and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at this site is the storage and blending of crop production and crop protection products for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for application.  The maximum quantity handled would be 187,149 pounds in one 30,000 gallon storage tank,  one 8,000 gallon storage tank, one 6,000 gallon storage tank, and one railroad tank car of 155,125 pounds.  The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a rail car holding, 155,125 pounds\n\n3.  The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n7 The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a railroad tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 155,125 pounds, which represents the volume of the storage vessel at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is 1.22 miles.\n \n7 The alternate release scenario is based on the potential incident resulting in a release from a break in a two-inch transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200 ppm} is .56 miles.\n \n4.  The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\nThe American Pride Coop has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American N"

The Five -Year Accident History \n\nThere has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at Henderson facility.  Furthermore; to our knowledge, there has been no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage caused by this facility.\n\n6.  The Emergency Response Program\n\nThe American Pride Coop, Henderson facility has a written emergency action plan in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.38.}  The American Pride Coop has provided to the Colorado Emergency Planning Commission and the Adams County local emergency planning committee the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III {EPCRA}.  The American Pride Coop has a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA's standard {29 CFR 1910.120}, including a memorandum of understanding with the Henderson Fire Department for response to our facility.  Additionally, the American Pride Coop has trained its employees in accordance with OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.\n\n7.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvements are an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations {at least annually} will be performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n"
