Based on a series of offsite consequence analyses (OCAs) performed using the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Manual, May 24, 1996, the worst case consequence scenario resulting from a catastrophic release of ammonia from the largest single vessel (the High Temperature Recirculator) would result in a toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles.  At this distance, several public and environmental receptors located beyond the property boundaries surrounding the facility would be impacted by such a release.

      "SummaryText": "Under the authority of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR 68) require facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute, or store certain chemicals to develop a Risk Management Program, prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP), and submit the RMP to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\r\n\r\nThe Mueller Quaker Dairy, LLC (MQD) facility, located in Batavia, New York uses and maintains an ammonia refrigeration system that will contain approximately 25,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia upon being fully charged.  Anhydrous Ammonia is a covered substance under the Risk Management Program with an applicability threshold of 10,000 pounds.  As such, the MQD facility is subject to the RMP requirements.  \r\n\r\nDepending on the specific characteristics of a covered process and the results of the offsite consequence analysis for that process, the process may be subject to one of three different sets of requirements, called program levels.   This report documents the steps undertaken by MQD to evaluate its program level and to implement obligations under this Federal requirement. \r\n\r\nBased on the evaluation performed by ERM in conjunction with MQD personnel, it was determined that the facility is eligible for classification under the Program level 3 requirements.  Program Level 3 eligibility requirements are detailed as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00bfThe facility must submit a single RMP, as provided in 40 CFR 68.150 through 68.185\r\n\u00bfThe facility must develop and implement a management system as provided in 40 CFR 68.15 that:\r\n\r\n o Oversees the implementation of the Risk Management Program elements;\r\n o Assigns a qualified person or position that will have the overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the Risk Management Program elements; and\r\n o Documents the lines of authority for administering the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n\u00bfThe facility must conduct a hazard assessment as provided in 68.20 through 68.42"
