(PAPCO) owns and operates a natural gas liquids recovery facility, the Warren Refrigeration Fractionation  Processing Plant, in Warren, Pennsylvania. The plant is designed to recover liquid products from natural gas via physical separation, dehydration, and refrigeration.  Petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas.   The plant handles and stores process flammables such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane and isopentane and heavier components in excess of threshold quantities. PAPCO management is aware of potential hazards posed by processing and storing natural gas and natural gas liquids. Programs are established to prevent accidental releases and train personnel for emergency response in the event of a release.  The Warren plant has no recordable accidents in the past five years.   \n\n\n\nPAPCO has considered the impact of a \"worst case\" accident.  In this case, the A!A?worst caseA!A? would be a complete release from one of the  30,000 gallon product storage tanks (propane or butanes or gasoline), resulting in instantaneous formation of a vapor cloud which ignites and explodes.

Global positioning system (GPS) was utilized to estimate public receptors within a 0.4 mile radius.

A consideration of the 0.4 mile radius is incorporated into our notification and emergency response planning.\n\n\n\nPAPCO implements safety programs and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Operation, maintenance, training, and inspection procedures are being implemented.  In addition, PAPCO has coordinated with local emergency responders, including the Warren Fire and Rescue Department, Clarendon Fire Department, Warren County Sheriff Department, Warren Police Department and the Warren Emergency Management.  Warren Plant personnel and responders have been given an Emergency Response Plan information. \n\n\n\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan is developed to provide information about our management of risks associated with natural gas processing and liquids recovery.

To estimate the gas leak, the following simplified equation was used to estimate a release rate based on hole , pipe pressure, and the properties of the gas. This equation applies to choked flow, or maximum gas flow rate. Choked flow generally would be expected for gases under pressure.\n\n\n\nQR = HA x Pt x 1/A!A?Tt x GF \n\n\n\nTo summarize, a pipe containing methane gas is broken.  Methane gas was chosen due to the fact that it has the highest heat of combustion of any element in the process stream.  The release rate was estimated from the above equation. We estimate that the broken pipe would leave a hole with an area (HA) of 6 square inches. The temperature inside the pipe (T, absolute temperature, Kelvin) is 282 K, the air temperature is assumed to be 25 degrees C, and the square root of the temperature T is 16.8. The pressure in the pipe (P) is approximately 465 pounds per square inch absolute (psia). From Exhibit C-2, Appendix C, of EPA 550-B-99-009, the gas factor (GF) for methane is 14. Therefore, the release rate (QR) is:\n\n2,279 lb/min.  The gas is assumed to leak for a maximum of 10 minutes yielding 22,790 lb methane gas released.  Methane gas was chosen to represent the alternative worst case scenario because it has the highest heat of combustion of any element in the process stream.  \n\n\n\nIn the alternative release analyses, it was assumed that the vapor cloud was released and ignited, resulting in a vapor cloud fire (VCF).
