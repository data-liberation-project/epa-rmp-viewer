Anhydrous Ammonia Load-in/Storage/Load-out (14,300 gallon gross water capacity) @ 62,600 pounds.\n \nProgram 2 is the default program level for all facilities.  This faciliy does not manufacture fertilizers.  It purchases the agricultural chemicals wholesale and sells them retail directly to the farmers, who then use the products.  As such, it is not an OSHA PSM facility, nor does it have an NAICS code which requires a Program 3.  The facility has a few public receptors within the worst-case zone and therefore does not qualify for Program 1.  Program 2 is therefore selected for this facility.\n\nThe prevention program emphasises procedural and managerial steps which enhance maintenance and training.  There have been no accidents in the last 5 years.\n\nThe emergency response program includes a facility-specific evacuation plan for which the personnel receive training, as well as the county-wide emergency response plan with the Tulare County Fire Protection District as the designated responding unit, and the provision for notifying other agencies in the even"
