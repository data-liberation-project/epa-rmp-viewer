As an integral part of this commitment, Ineos has developed and implemented a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, emergency response and employee training associated with the processes at its Plaquemine, Louisiana facility.  This program complies with all of the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, \"Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions\" and with Chapter 59 of LAC 33:III, \"Chemical Accident Prevention and Minimization of  Consequences\".\n\nIt is Ineos' policy to always operate the manufacturing processes in a safe manner and according to the established procedures and good engineering and management practices.  As part of this policy, Ineos has established the appropriate management and administrative controls for the prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event that such a release may occur, trained emergency response personnel are available on site to take the necessary and appropriate corrective action to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  \n\nIneos has also established lines of communication with the Iberville Parish Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), in the event that an accidental chemical release may have beyond-the-fenceline effects and that additional emergency response expertise may be deemed necessary.\n\nFigure 1 presents an organization chart that shows the Ineos staff and supervisory positions responsible for the implementation of the various parts of the RMP program, in compliance with 40 CFR 68.15\n\n2.\tStationary Sources and Reg"

      "SummaryText": "ulated Substances Handled\n\nIn February 2001, Ineos and the Dow Chemical Company (Dow) finalized agreements whereby Ineos, as an independent business entity, operates the existing production units at the Dow Plaquemine facilities known as Block 55. Specifically, Ineos owns and operates the ethanolamines unit and operates the glycol ethers and polyethylene glycol units for Dow.    The 3 production units that now comprise the Ineos facility manufacture approximately 18 different ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivatives used in a wide variety of consumer products such as antifreeze, shampoo ingredients, automotive fluids, cosmetics, and water purification chemicals.  \n\nIneos uses a few organic chemicals as raw materials, including ethylene and propylene oxides, methanol, n-Butanol and ethylene glycol.  Inorganic chemicals used in the process include phosphoric acid, potassium hydroxide and ammonia, among others. Although chlorine is not used in the manufacturing processes, it is used on site for cooling water treatment.  \n\nNone of the products and byproducts manufactured at the Ineos facility is regulated under the risk management program (RMP) established by Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  The only RMP-regulated substances present at Ineos above the RMP threshold quantities are Chlorine and Ammonia (anhydrous).  Ethylene oxide  [Oxirane] and Propylene oxide  [Oxirane, methyl-] are both used as raw materials in the Ineos processes, but they are received by pipeline from nearby Dow facilities on a continuous basis and as needed in the chemical manufacturing processes.  Consequently, there are no storage facilities for these two chemicals within the Ineos Block 55 perimeter.\n\nMaximum inventories and threshold quantities for the RMP-regulated substances at the Ineos facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana are shown on the table below.\n\n\nTable 1\n112(r) Regulated Chemicals Present at the Ineos-Plaquemine Facility\nand their Threshold Quantities\n\nRMP Regulated Subs"

No storage of these chemicals over the RMP threshold quantities takes place within the Ineos perimeter.  The amounts shown are the volumes of the existing in-line surge drums.\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is received on the Ineos plant site primarily by pipeline and four times a year by railroad tank cars. It is stored under pressure in a spherical tank, DS-205.  From this tank, it is pumped into the process.  DS-205 has a gross storage capacity of  approximately 750,000 lbs. of ammonia, but the necessary administrative controls (written operating procedures and level controls and alarms) are in place to limit the maximum amount of ammonia in the tank to 500,000 lbs.  DS-205 has no refrigeration, therefore the material is kept under pressure and, according to operating personnel,  the storage temperature is usually between 75 deg F. and 85 degs F. The vapor pressure of anhydrous ammonia in this temperature range is between 140 and 180 psia.\n\nChlorine. The Ineos manufacturing processes do not use chlorine either as a raw material or as a reagent.  This chemical is only used for cooling water treatment, and two (2) one-ton cylinders are kept on site next to the cooling tower, for a maximum total amount of 4,000 lbs. of chlorine kept on site.  One cylinder is connected to the cooling tower and the other one is kept on stand-by.  The chlorine feed line is connected to the vapor side of the one-ton cylinder.  When the first cylinder is empty, the second cylinder is connected and a full cylinder placed on order.\n\n\n3.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIneos has taken all the ne"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the Ineos facility.\n\nHealth and safety procedures are being reviewed and revised as needed by Ineos.  The last review/revision of the theses procedures was in November 2010. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Ineos facility maintains detailed records of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes, including those that involve the regulated chemicals, ammonia and chlorine.  Documentation kept on site provides information regarding the chemical properties and chemical hazards associated with the regulated chemicals. These documents include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Copies of current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's), \n* Equipment specifications and manufacturer's design data, \n* Complete sets of construction drawings and specifications\n* A copy of the plant's Emergency Response Plan\n* Copies of Shop Drawings and assembly and maintenance instructions for all major components\n* Copies of the Operator's daily log sheets, showing material inventories and a record of the shipments of chemicals delivered on site.\n\nThe above records are updated as applicable and necessary.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nComprehensive studies were conducted by Dow to ensure that hazards associated with all processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  These studies included the process units that now comprise the Ineos facility. The methodologies used to carry out these analyses include What If/Checklist (combined), HAZOP, the Dow Fire and Explosion Index, the Dow Chemical Exposure Index, and Reactive Chemicals/Process Hazards Analysis (PHA).  It is Dow's practice that these studies be undertaken periodically by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering"

The most recent PHA/update on the process systems was performed by INEOS's technical staff on 09/14/2009.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within the manufacturing processes, Ineos maintains complete and up to date written standard operating procedures (SOP's) for each process.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  The SOP's also discuss potential deviations from the standard operating conditions, how to prevent such deviations and the corrective steps to take if and when they do occur. Operating information and process parameters are readily accessible to operators involved in the processes and the SOP's are reviewed and updated periodically and if required when any process changes are implemented (see also Management of Change section below).  The SOP's for the Ineos facilities are reviewed based on procedure user policy which falls into two review periods. Level-3 SOP's are considered critical and are reviewed annually and level 1-2 are reviewed every three years. \n\nAll SOP's are kept electronically on the plant's electronic document management system.  This allows for the control of all copies by the document manager and prevents unauthorized changes in the documents.  They are readily accessible 24 hours/day and located on computers in the control room.  Copies may be printed for use, and are labeled as \"uncontrolled\" copies.\n\n\nTraining\n\nIneos has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the manufacturing processes are competent in the opera"

It is Ineos policy that all new employees receive the necessary initial training according to their intended position and responsibilities and that periodic refresher training sessions are provided as needed.\n\nMaintenance and Mechanical Integrity\n\nThe Ineos facility has established a well-documented preventive maintenance (PM) program to ensure proper operations of all equipment. It includes periodic checks to verify that all equipment is always in good operating condition.  Process equipment examined by these periodic checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, pumps and process control systems and components. \n\nAny equipment deficiencies identified by the PM checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.  PM activities and routine maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Ineos to manage and document changes in process chemicals and raw materials, technology, equipment and/or operating procedures.  The most recent review/revision of MOC procedures was completed on 04/15/09 triggered by an internal PSM audit.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks and responsibilities are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and provided the necessary  training so that they understand the modification(s), the reason(s) for it (them) and how their job responsibilities will be affected as a result.\n\nIneos' MOC procedures were implemented under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements, thereby they are compliant with RMP requirements as w"

These procedures require, among other things, that process safety considerations be evaluated anytime that a process change is considered, to determine whether a process hazard analysis (PHA) is warranted and to evaluate any potential on-site and off-site impacts.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nProcedures are in place at Ineos to perform Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in existing processes. The most recent review was performed by INEOS on 3/25/2010(DS-205).  The purpose of these reviews is not only to confirm that the new or modified equipment and systems have been constructed and installed with all the necessary safety features, but also to establish that the operating and maintenance procedures are fully adequate and that they include all of the necessary information for safe startup, before the system is actually placed into operation.\n\nInternal Compliance Audits\n\nSimilarly, Ineos will conduct audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  There was a PSM compliance audit conducted by INEOS on 012/04/2009, certified by Professional Safety Associates, LLC,Steven P. Pereira, CSP. This also covered all RMP compliance requirments.\n\nIneos will continue to conduct these audits at least once every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits will be addressed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIneos incident investigation procedures were established in compliance with OSHA's PSM requirements.  Ineos has adopted these procedures and will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation, conditions and contributing factors leading to the incident as well as to identify any corrective actions to prevent the incident from reoccurring.

An integral part of the contractor selection procedure is a thorough evaluation of each candidate's safety performance.  After such a contract has been awarded but before the actual work commences, all of the contractor's employees who will be performing work inside the plant must undergo, as a condition of the contract, a mandatory safety orientation.   As part of this orientation, Ineos will inform the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes involved.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response, should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.  Contractors are also required to inform Ineos of any hazards they may introduce at the site.\n\n4.\tFive-year Accident History\n Ineos operations has not experience, within the last 5 years, any accidental releases of regulated substances that were reportable under 40 CFR 68.42(a) (i. e. that resulted in deaths, injuries or significant onsite property damage or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in place, property damage or environmental damage).
