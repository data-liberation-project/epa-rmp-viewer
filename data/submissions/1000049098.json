The Supervisor of each area, in conjunction with the Department Manager, is responsible for ensuring the PSI remains up to date. \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nATI provides appropriate resources to make the working environment around regulated substances safe. To assist in assuring a safe, controlled process, hazards are identified through the Process Hazard Analyses performed on each of the areas regulated by PSM/RMP. \r\n\r\nATI has performed Process Hazard Analyses (PHA) on each of the regulated processes. ATI will update the hazard analysis at least every five years to assure that the PHA remains applicable to any process improvements and changes. The level of detail in the PHA is intended to be appropriate to the complexity of the process. A copy of each PHA is available on the PSM/RMP SharePoint Page. The Department Manager, or designee, in coordination with the PSM Coordinator, are responsible for scheduling the PHAs and notifying the supervisor of maintenance, engineering, and operations of the area. The supervisors are responsible for ensuring appropriate representatives participate in the PHA. The ongoing recordkeeping requirements for  process hazard analysis are: \r\n\u00bfDocum"

The ATI facility at 1600 Old Salem Road in Albany, Oregon has developed management systems in compliance with various applicable regulations to prevent the release of regulated substances especially in locations which may cause detrimental effects to employees, the community, or the environment. This is accomplished through a systematic evaluation of process design, process technology, operational procedures, maintenance activities, non-routine procedures, emergency preparedness, training, and several other factors. \r\n\r\nThe facility plans to meet or exceed regulatory requirements. In the attempt to accomplish this goal, the management systems at the facility have been developed in such a way that the hazards are identified, understood, and controlled to prevent accidents and releases. The RMP regulated chemicals include chlorine and aqueous ammonia. \r\n\r\nPrograms have been developed to comply with OSHA's 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and EPA's 40 CFR part 68 subpart D, Accidental Release Prevention Provisions in the Risk Management Program.\r\n\r\n2.The stationary source and the regulated substances handled. \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to extract zirconium and hafnium metal from zirconium oxides and produce various metal alloy products. These products are sold to customers who produce final products for the nuclear industry, the industrial chemical process industry and other related industries. Zirconium chemical products as well as byproducts are also sold. \r\n\r\nThe regulated substances handled at th"

The development of the worst-case scenario is dictated by the EPA. The amount of the substance released for the worst-case scenario is equal to the greatest amount held in a single vessel or pipe line. For toxic chemicals that are normally gases at ambient temperature and are handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the chemical is assumed to be released as a gas over 10 minutes. The release rate to the atmosphere is calculated as the quantity released divided by 10 minutes unless passive mitigation is in place. \r\n\r\nThe alternative case release scenarios for the regulated toxic substances were developed by ATI based upon experience with the substances. These scenarios are considered more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenarios. However, the alternative case release scenarios are still considered unlikely to occur. As part of its release prevention program, discussed in detail in the next section, ATI is constantly monitoring, reviewing, and upgrading its standard operating procedures and equipment. In addition, ATI has developed a detailed Emergency Action Plan (EAP)to minimize the effects of a release should one occur. In addition to these administrative controls, ATI has automatic release mitigation systems in place for the regulated substances, which are discussed below. \r\n\r\nThe distance to the toxic endpoint for the worst-case and alternative case scenarios for each substance was calculated using EPA's RMPComp computer"

The RMPComp model is considered conservative and would generally give longer distances than computer modeling developed specifically for ATI. \r\n\r\nFor the following reasons the 2004 modeling used to calculate distance to the toxic endpoint continues to be valid: \r\n\u00bfAmounts of regulated substances handled at ATI have been reduced due to the elimination of on-site storage of phosgene and titanium tetrachloride. This elimination is due to process changes from the substitution of raw material feed stocks.\r\n\u00bfThe worst-case and alternative case scenarios for chlorine and aqueous ammonia are unchanged.\r\n\u00bfThe worst-case and alternative case scenarios for phosgene and titanium tetrachloride have been deleted.\r\n\u00bfThe population numbers were updated using 2010 U.S. Census data.\r\n\r\n4.The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps. \r\n\r\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements which will help the facility to minimize releases of regulated substances. A description of each of the elements is given below: \r\n\r\nEmployee Participation \r\n\r\nThe Facility has involved employees in the development and implementation of the elements of Process Safety Management and the Prevention Program. ATI encourages employees to participate with the understanding that their participation is a key factor to the success of any program. ATI is committed to maintaining a safe workplace, and as a result all employees are responsible for adhering to the PSM/RMP regulations. ATI has committed to the following: \r\n\u00bfIncluding employees from the process in Process Hazard Analyses \r\n\u00bfConsulting employees on the development of PSM/RMP regulation elements \r\n\u00bfProviding employees with access to the information developed through the PSM and RMP rules. \r\n\r\nA description of the Employee Participation Program is provided in the Process Safe"

The PSSR verifies the following information: \r\n\u00bfTraining is complete \r\n\u00bfSOPs are complete \r\n\u00bfConstruction/equipment is in accordance with the design specifications \r\n\u00bfA PHA has been complete, if it is a new facility \r\n\r\nRecords of the PSSRs and procedures are available on the Safety SharePoint Page The supervisor of the area/ construction project leader is responsible for ensuring a PSSR is performed. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity \r\n\r\nATI provides appropriate resources to ensure that the equipment used to process, store, or handle highly regulated substances is designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases of the regulated substances into the workplace or community. To accomplish this goal, a Mechanical Integrity Program is in place to ensure the continued integrity of the processes. The Mechanical Integrity Program is implemented for the systems that could potentially result in the release of a hazardous chemical. The program utilizes increased maintenance training, and preventive maintenance in conjunction with regular inspections and tests, to ensure equipment is in satisfactory condition. A summary of the Mechanical Integrity Program is found on the PSM/RMP SharePoint Page with more details located in the maintenance shop and production departments.
