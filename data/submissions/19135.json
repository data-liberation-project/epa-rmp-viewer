ARE COMMITTED TO THE PREVENTION OF ANY ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.  IF AN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SHOULD OCCUR, THE FACILITY IS PREPARED TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, OR OTHER AUTHORITIES, TO MITIGATE ANY RELEASE AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE RELEASE TO THE PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.\n\n2)     THE PRIMARY ACTIVITY AT THE FACILITY IS THE STORAGE AND BLENDING OF FERTILIZERS FOR SALE TO THE FARMERS.  \nANYHDROUS AMMONIA IS RECEIVED, STORED, AND DISTRIBUTED FOR APPLICATION FOR A CROP PROTECTION NUTRIENT.\nTHE MAXIMUM QUANTITY STORED WOULD BE 210,000#   IN TWO 18,000 GALLON AND A 12,000 GALLON STORAGE TANKS.  THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY HANDLED WOULD BE THE UNLOADING OF A SEMI-TRANSPORT CONTAINING 41,000#.\n\n3)     THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO WOULD BE THE RELEASE OF THE TOTAL CONTENTS OF A STORAGE TANK. THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASE WOULD BE 79,000 LBS.  WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE STORAGE TANK AT 85% CAPACITY AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\n\n4)     THE FACILITY HAS IMPLEMENTED THE PROVISIONS OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, K-61.1 PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDS INSTITUTE, INC. AND THE STANDARDS OF THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION  (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111.  STORAGE AND HANDLING OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\n\n5)     THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n             A)  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT:\n                         HAVE CAUSED ANY DEATH, INJURY, OR SIGNIFICANT PROPERTY DAMAGE A THE FACILITY: NOR\n                         TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, HAVE RESULTED IN OFF SITE DEATHS, INJURIES, EVACUATIONS, SHELTERIN"
