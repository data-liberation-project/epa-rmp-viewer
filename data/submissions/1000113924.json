      "SummaryText": "1.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Evergreen Packaging Pine Bluff Mill (EP Pine Bluff) has a long-standing commitment to operating the mill in a manner that is safe for our employees, the public, and the environment. A primary aspect of this commitment is the EP Pine Bluff system to help ensure the safe operation of our processes. Our commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention such as considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes, and by the extensive training of our operating personnel.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, EP Pine Bluff will implement procedures which are designed to control and contain the release in a manner which will be safe for our employees and will help prevent injury to the public and the environment. EP Pine Bluff\u0092s emergency response personnel receive thorough training in handling accidental releases. A Safety & Health Manager has been assigned to oversee response activities and to coordinate response efforts with local emergency agencies. Communications with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) served to support the original preparation of this plan and policies.\n\nTo effectively implement these policies, EP Pine Bluff established a management system headed by the Manager of Environmental Health and Safety to ensure the proper implementation and effectiveness of our Risk Management Program (RMP).\n\n2.0\t REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nEP Pine Bluff is primarily involved in the manufacture of high-quality bleached paperboard. To manufacture our products, EP Pine Bluff utilizes one substance, chlorine dioxide, which is regulated by the Risk Management Program Rule (the Rule) contained in 40 CFR 68. The chlorine dioxide used at EP Pine Bluff is generated on site, immediately absorbed into water, and then stored in a 1.05% solution. The Rule requires that all regulated toxic substances stored in quantities above the specified thresholds"

      "SummaryText": "are included in an RMP. Chlorine dioxide is present in an aqueous solution in storage tanks above the threshold quantity of 1,000 pounds. \n\nChlorine dioxide is also used in the water treatment process. This process uses a blend of purate (sodium chlorate and hydrogen peroxide) and sulfuric acid to produce chlorine dioxide for immediate use. There is no chlorine dioxide stored for this process; therefore, this chlorine dioxide process is not covered by the Rule. The regulated use of chlorine dioxide at EP Pine Bluff is as follows:\n\nTable 1.  Summary of ClO2 storage tanks.\nProcess Description\tProgram Level\tRegulated Substance\tMaximum Process Quantity\nChlorine Dioxide System\t3\tChlorine dioxide\t52,740 lb\n\n3.0\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nEP Pine Bluff performed an offsite consequence analysis to estimate the potential impacts of an accidental release of chlorine dioxide from our process. Chlorine dioxide was evaluated for possible worse case and alternative release scenarios. It is important to understand that EP Pine Bluff has invested extensive resources to prevent releases, and the potential for a worse case release is extremely small. The alternative release scenarios, though also highly unlikely, present a more realistic potential for occurrence and are based on historical data from our process or other similar processes. By identifying these potential releases, EP Pine Bluff has prepared an extensive program to prevent such an occurrence. This program is discussed in detail in the \u0093Prevention Program\u0094 section of this plan.\n\nThe primary objective of performing the offsite consequences analysis is to determine the distance at which the public and/or the environment might be affected in the event of an accidental release. This point is called the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects would be greater. The offsite consequence analysis can be found within the Hazard Assessment Documentation section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n4.0\tACCIDENT"

The requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management standard are nearly identical to Program 3 Prevention Program requirements of the Rule. The Prevention Program for the Chlorine Dioxide System is well developed and was in place prior to the implementation of the Rule.\n\nThe Chlorine Dioxide System Prevention Program consists of the following twelve elements.\n\n4.1\tProcess Safety Information\n\nEP Pine Bluff maintains a variety of technical documents that help ensure the safe operation of our processes. These documents address:\n\n\u0095\tphysical properties of hazardous substances handled,\n\u0095\tchemical properties and associated hazards of those substances,\n\u0095\toperating parameters and limitation(s) of the process equipment,\n\u0095\tdesign basis and configuration of the equipment, and\n\u0095\tspecific chemical inventories.\n\nEP Pine Bluff ensures the process safety information is available to all mill employees, the LEPC, and the local fire department and that the process safety information is kept up to date. The Safety & Health Manager is responsible for maintaining and updating this information as needed.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).  This information is supplemented by other technical information specific for these chemicals.  Continuous attention is given to revisions and updates on the hazards of chlorine dioxide and other chemicals used in our processes.  Information regarding toxicity, environmental impacts, corrosion concerns, inadvertent mixing hazards, and other safety and health concerns are addressed and communicated to the appropriate parties.\n\nEP Pine Bluff also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information a"

With this program, the Chlorine Dioxide System is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nTo perform the PHAs, EP Pine Bluff primarily uses the hazard and operability study (HAZOP) technique supplemented with checklists. The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorine Dioxide System operation and a leader with experience in PHA techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when appropriate. The team then prepare"

Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the Manager of Pulp and is tracked through completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\tTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, EP Pine Bluff periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorine Dioxide System is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained. The team findings are forwarded to the Manager of Pulp for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3\tOperating Procedures\n\nEP Pine Bluff engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Chlorine Dioxide System operation should be safely performed. These written procedures address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n\u0095\tunit startup,\n\u0095\tnormal operations,\n\u0095\ttemporary operations,\n\u0095\temergency shutdown,\n\u0095\tnormal shutdown, and\n\u0095\tinitial startup of a new process.\n\nThe written operating procedures include:\n\n\u0095\tsteps for safely conducting process tasks,\n\u0095\tapplicable process safety information, such as safe operating limits and consequences of process deviations, and\n\u0095\tsafety and health considerations, such as chemical hazards, personal protective equipment requirements, and action(s) to take in the event of an exposure to a hazardous substance.\n\n4.4\tTraining\n\nEP Pine Bluff trains workers, including supervisors with process operational respon"
