We store and distribute a wide variety of pesticides and fertilizers, including Aqueous Ammonia.  We are committed to the prevention of accidental releases of these products at our facility.  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling aqueous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby businesses and members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Local, State, and Federal rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle aqueous ammonia, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility.  This is culminated in the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\n\n\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38; has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA); has coordinated to the best of the abilities of Wilson Fertilizer Management response actions with the Local Fire Departments, including pre-emergency planning and emergency training; attempts to verify annually that the County Emergency Plan includes the facility in the event of a release of regulated substances; and, has instructed employees on procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nAqueous Ammonia is received by truck and is stored in bulk and portable tanks.  This facility has equipment for unloading transports and equipment to load semis.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel, customers, an"

Periodic inspections by the Office of the Indiana State Chemist are also conducted.  Employees involved in aqueous ammonia activities are trained thoroughly by the Management Team, contractor(s), insurance company representatives, and industry experts.  Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observations.\n\n\n\nThe major hazards identified with aqueous ammonia include toxic release, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquakes, and tornado.\n\n\n\nCheck valves and manual shutoff valves are utilized to minimize the potential for release.\n\n\n\nMaintenance programs are also in place.  Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date, or if a system or process is changed or upgraded.  The Office of the Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment, tanks, and safety training (they do not always leave documentation).  In addition, employees utilizing the equipment on a near daily basis informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have not been any reportable or investigated incidents at this facility\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has an emergency action plan, in accor"
