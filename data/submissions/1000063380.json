      "SummaryText": "The Andersons Ethanol, LLC\n\nAlbion Ethanol RMP Executive Summary\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC is located at 26250 B Drive North in Albion, Michigan.  The facility is located near the intersection of Michigan Ave. and B-Drive North in Sheridan Township, which is in Calhoun County.\n\n\n\nThe Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 55 people.  The following operations are performed at this facility:  grain receiving and storage; hammer milling;  fermentation;  distillation, dehydration and evaporation (DDE);  separation;  wet and dry distillers grain and solubles (WDGS / DDGS) drying, storage and shipping; corn oil separation; and ethanol storage and shipping.  A CO2 plant is co-located on the property on a parcel that is leased to a third-party business. \n\n\n\nThe plant receives corn by way of the pre-existing grain elevator or the secondary truck dump at the ethanol plant.  Corn is stored temporarily in the concrete silos, prior to being fed to eight hammer mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area.\n\n\n\nAdditives are incorporated into the process and the product is fermented, creating a beer mash.  The product goes through a scrubbing process to removed residual volatile organics and then enters the distillation and condensation process.  The beer is approximately 14% ethanol and 86% non-fermentable corn solids.  The ethanol is separated from the beer at this stage and leaves as 190-proof ethanol, which is sent to a bulk storage tank.  The 190-proof contains residual water, so it is filtered one more time, which produces 200-proof ethanol.  Lastly, the 200-proof ethanol is mixed with a denaturant and stored in either of three tanks prior to transferring to the truck or rail load-out areas.  Emissions from the DDGS drying process are controlled through a recuperative thermal oxidizers.\n\n\n\nThe distillation process removes the ethanol from the beer, non-"

      "SummaryText": "fermentable corn solids and water.  The remaining water is then removed from the residual mash or whole stillage.  The resulting product is called wet distillers grain (WDG).  A small amount of WDGS will be maintained as \"wet cake\" - having a moisture content of 65 - 70% -- and sold directly to customers as high quality animal feed.  Storage of wet cake is very limited, on the south side of the Energy Center.  The majority of WDG will be dried to approximately 12% moisture.  The resulting product is called dried distillers grain (DDG), which can be stored for extended periods of time in the large barn at the southeast corner of the property.  After leaving the dryers, the DDG is cooled before going to storage.\n\n\n\nRecuperative thermal oxidizers serve as the primary emission control devices for the five dryers as well as various process vents.  The thermal oxidizers are very efficient at controlling particulates, carbon monoxide, VOC's, HAP's and nuisance odors.\n\n\n\nThe facility also has two water cooling towers for non-contact cooling water used in the fermentation process and two fire pumps for emergency use.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMP Applicability & Chemical Description\n\n\n\nThe presence of four constituents in the natural gasoline used to denature the ethanol requires participation in the Risk Management Plan.  Natural gasoline is a flammable mixture.  The four constituents of natural gasoline subject to the Risk Management Plan are butane, pentane, neo-pentane or 2,2-dimethylpropane, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane.  Butane makes up 0.806% of the natural gasoline, pentane makes up 24.518%, neo-pentane or 2,2-dimethylpropane makes up 0.237%, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane makes up 22.96%.\n\n\n\nNatural gasoline is stored in a 165,000 gallon steel tank in the facility's tank farm.  Secondary containment consisting of a diked structure containing an impermeable liner and gravel overlay surrounds the tank farm.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release\n\n\n\nThe worst cas"

The storage tank capacity is 165,000 gallons or 910,800 pounds.  Of the 910,800 pounds, 441,989 pounds are made up of the materials subject to the Risk Management Plan.  \n\n\n\nAlternative Release\n\n\n\nThe most likely cause of a natural gasoline emergency is a release during a delivery due to a faulty hose or valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Deliveries are made by truck or railcar and pumped into the storage tank.  Deliveries by truck are typically 9,000 gallons or 49,680 pounds of which 24,105 pounds are RMP materials.  Deliveries by railcar are typically 30,000 gallons or 165,600 pounds of which 80,351 pounds are RMP materials.\n\n\n\nAll truck deliveries are made during business hours and are observed by the truck driver and facility personnel.  If a release were to occur the truck delivery, attendants could stop the flow within minutes.  The railcar unloading is attended by facility personnel at all times who would stop the flow from the pump and close the valve on the railcar in the event of a release.  The truck load-out area has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment.  The railcar unloading area has a containment dike.\n\n\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no denaturant-related accidents in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nPreventive maintenance is an integral piece of this facility's hazard management program.  All equipment including hoses, tanks, and valves are inspected at least monthly.  A good PM program is our strongest defense against a release of denaturant.  All hose replacements are documented.  Records of all maintenance tasks performed on the tank or appendages are also on file.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of How Natural Gasoline (Denaturant) Releases are Prevented\n\n\n\nPassive Mitigation\n\nThe natural gasoline storage and unloading areas are equipped with secondary containment.

Electrical equipment in the tank farm area is rated for Class 1 Division 1 to prevent any leakage from being ignited by electrical equipment. \n\n\n\nActive Mitigation\n\nHot work in the unloading area and tank farm is strictly controlled by hot work permits.  Unloading operations are attended at all times as described above.  Some of the fire hydrant(s) around the tank farm are equipped with water cannons to allow for fire suppression/control from a safe distance.  An emergency shutdown device is located at the truck load-out booth that will shutdown on pumps in the tank farm.  A Scully Signal System is used to prevent overfilling a truck.  The Scully System is programmed to automatically shut down loading when the amount designated by the truck driver is loaded into the truck.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nAll employees receive annual training on flammable liquids, emergency action plan and spill procedures, and hazard communication.  Documentation and attendance rosters are on file at the facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nContractors that are hired by The Andersons, Inc. go through a documented Prequalification process.
