The reason for submitting this RMP is to comply with the mandatory five years update and to report the change of ownership from ConAgra Poultry Company to Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Corporation.  This facility has one ammonia refrigeration systems with an inventory capacity above the EPA threshold reporting quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the system has not changed since the last RMP plan submitted in January 1999, and no significant additional controls have been added to the process.\n\nManagement at the Pilgrim\u00bfs Pride Athens, AL Processing Plant recognizes its responsibility in protecting employees, equipment, property, and the environment.  The safety and health of all personnel and the neighboring community are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the facility.\n\nPilgrim's Pride Corporation is committed to the safety of its employees, the communities surrounding its plants, and the environment.  This commitment includes both human health and environmental protection.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the refrigeration process equipment.  The Emergency Response Plan focuses on reducing the potential impact of an accidental release.  This is done by coordinating emergency actions of the plant HAZMAT Team with the Athens Fire Department.  This is achieved by ensuring that employees are trained on the proper response to an emergency situation and by getting the members of the Fire Department acquainted with the facility.\n\nBecause anhydrous ammonia is listed by both the US Occupational Safety and Heal"

These regulations are designed to prevent the accidental release of ammonia and minimize negative consequences in the event that a release should occur.  Our emergency response policy is designed to comply with all government emergency response regulations.\n\nAn offsite consequence analysis was performed for the Athens, AL facility site, including consideration of ammonia release scenarios as \u00bfworst case release\u00bf and \u00bfalternative release scenario\u00bf. We do have several active mitigation systems to minimize any effect incidents like these would have.
