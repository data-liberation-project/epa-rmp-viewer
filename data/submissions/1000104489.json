Broco Terminals is a CAP Program 3 facility, and EPA CAP Program 3 requirements fulfill OSHA PSM requirements.   \n\nThe RMP/PSM Manual contains the policies and procedures used at the Broco Terminal to assure continued compliance with the EPA CAP and OSHA PSM regulations. Most of the sections in this RMP/PSM Manual follow a standard format that includes the purpose, responsibilities, procedures, and documents. \n\nEmployees are required to review relevant elements of the procedures in this RMP/PSM program. This plan is available on-site for employee review. Recommendations to improve this document\u2019s accuracy or effectiveness can be directed to the Terminal Manager.\n\nThe goal of the RMP/PSM program, including supporting policies and procedures, is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur.\n\nThe 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) required EPA to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere and to reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.\n\nCovered facilities also must submit registration information (RMP Submission) to EPA no later than June 21, 1999 or the date on which the facility first has more than a threshold quantity in use or stored at the site, whichever is later. Covered facilities are also required to re-submit their Risk Management Plans every five years. The RMP Submission provides an electronic summary of the facility\u2019s Risk Management Plan.\n\nCovered facilities also must continue to implement the management practices documented in this plan and update their plans periodically or when processes change, as required by the rule."
