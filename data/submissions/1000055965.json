Risk prevention and emergency response procedures are in place at this facility.  The Emergency Response Plan lists the responsible personnel and the policies for responding to an accident involving the regulated substance.\r\n\r\nEarthbound Farm facility has both fixed and portable refrigeration systems onsite composed of  compressors with common thermosyphon receiver , evaporative condensers, vacuum tubes, evaporative cooling coils, pressure vessels, ammonia pumps, water chillers, ice generators and diffusion tanks. All compressors have safety switches that would shut down the compressors upon detection of unsafe operating conditions. All the pressure vessels and the compressors are protected by safety relief valves against high pressure situations.  There are ammonia detectors in the cold rooms and in the mechanical room for alarming. There is a list of responders experienced with ammonia refrigeration that would respond and determine specific responses for any incident.  Safeties and detection equipment are tested and maintained by experienced maintenance personnel as spelled out in the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) and testing and inspection program.\r\n\r\nEmergency response training will be conducted yearly for current employees and as required for new employees.  Records will be kept of all training performed at the site for a minimum of five (5) years.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF SOURCE AND SUBSTANCE HANDLED\r\nAmmonia refrigeration systems are used for cold storage, water chilling, produce precooling and ice generation. A fixed system is attached to the main storage and processing building and is used for cold storage, water chilling, ice generation.  Portable units support three vacuum cooling tubes.  The total charge for the all the refrigeration systems is approximately 65,000 LBS.\r\n\r\nThe Earthbound Farm facility is locate"

This facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in their precooling, cold rooms and process water chilling operations. Fresh produce is brought from the fields and cooled to remove field heat.  The produce is then packaged and stored in a cold storage warehouse prior to shipment from refrigerated docks.\r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration system equipment at the facility consists of portable and permanently installed equipment. The main refrigeration system configuration includes:  Low Pressure Re-circulating units with ammonia pumps, cold room evaporators, various safety equipment including refrigerant discharge diffusion tanks, compressors with a common thermosyphon receiver, evaporative cooling condensers, a high-pressure receiver and a plate and frame make-up water chiller, along with nine falling film water chillers in the processing rooms\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia (NH3) is a gas in its natural state and is extremely irritating to mucous membranes and lung tissue. The gas is pungent and may be suffocating as shortness of breath and labored breathing can develop if inhaled. Prolonged inhalation of high concentrations may cause bronchitis and/ or pneumonia, with some residual reduction in pulmonary functions. Repeated or prolonged contact of high concentrations of ammonia to the skin can cause frostbite, redness, pain and serious skin burn.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\nAn offsite consequence analysis for an ammonia release was performed to determine impacts to neighboring schools, businesses, residences, recreation areas, and historical and environmentally sensitive sites.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nEarthbound Farm maintains a release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases.  The program includes regular inspections, monitoring equipment and logging conditions, scheduled maintenance, and operator training.

Operators and mechanics are trained for safe operation and maintenance of the refrigeration system.  They are also trained in emergency response procedures in the event of an ammonia release.  There are emergency shut off switches outside the mechanical room for shutting down the system.  Ammonia detectors are installed in all refrigerated rooms and the mechanical room.  Personnel will automatically be notified if any detector exceeds set point.  Monitoring is 24 hours per day.  An emergency control box and diffusion tank allows system pressure to be relieved manually.

The Hazmat Team Chief is responsible in coordinating emergency response and will be contacting emergency response agencies, schools, daycare centers, and acute care facilities that may be affected by the release.
