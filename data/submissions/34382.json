              "Description": "ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\n\nPrevention Program Review: This facility implements a Prevention Program to minimize the risk of release, incident, or accident through the following activities: \n1. Safety information is reviewed periodically, no less than annually. The Company employs a Safety Coordinator; the Coordinator oversees training, safety, and conducts periodic site and equipment audits. Site Inspections are also carried out by the local fire department, and our loss control provider periodically inspects the site for compliance and safety.\n2. The major hazards identified with the process include toxic release, overpressurization, overfilling, equipment failure, earthquake, and tornado. Process controls, such as relief valves, check valves, grounding equipment, manual shutoffs (ESOV's), electrical remote shutoffs,  procedures, and excess flow devices are utilized to minimize the potential for release. \n3. Mitigation systems available include a deluge or water curtain provided by the responding fire department in the event of a release which would \"knock down\" the vapor cloud and neutralize the ammonia. The site has access to city water for vapor suppression.\n4. Employees are trained on an initial and ongoing basis. Employee Training is provided as well as annual refresher training available from our Safety Coordinator, industry seminars, and vendor programs. Competency is measured through written and oral testing, demonstration (hands-on), and observation. \n5. Maintenance programs are in place. Items are replaced if they fail, present a risk to the user, are required by law or standard, are out-of-date,  or if a system or process is changed or upgraded. OSHA 1910.111 standards are used to identify those needs. The Indiana State Chemist also makes periodic unannounced visits to our facility to inspect equipment, tanks, and safety training (they do not always leave documentation). In addition, employees utilizing the equipment on a nearly daily basis informally inspect the equipment for leaks, cracks, soundness, etc.",

HAMILTON COUNTY CO-OP employees receive regular training in the areas of operations and safety to minimize the potential of a release due to human error.\n\nThis facility is on a 9 acre complex  with over 9 building where different service oriented businesses are operated.  Anhydrous ammonia is received by transport truck,  stored in a bulk storage vessel, and redistributed as a fertilizer for our farmer members.  Our maximum quantity stored at any time is 140,000 pounds or 17,000 gallons in a 30,000 gallon capacity tank.\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be to have all the ammonia released from the tank and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 PPM.  According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. \n\nAs an alternative release scenario in the event of equipment failure, (transfer hose failure) and reaching a toxic endpoint of 200 PPM. According to DEGADIS modeling, this release (distance from point of dispersion to 200 ppm) would have off-site impact. \n\nWe have instituted procedures for storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia as required by OSHA 1910.111 and the INDIANA STATE CHEMIST into our plan.\n\nWe have not had release resulting in any of the criteria stated in 40 CFR 68.48 in the past 5 years.\n\nOur Emergency  Action Plan is up to date and all current personnel have been trained in the procedures.  In the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, the Hamilton County LEPC/HAZMAT Team will respond to the incident. Our facility is included in the county emergency plan administered by the LEPC. All new hires will receive this training as part of their new employee orientation.  All agencies, contracted emergency care providers and tenants have received training in the hazards associated with a release anhydrous am"

Through our inspection process and insistence of maintaining equipment with the federal, state, and local agencies, the opportunity for accidental releases will have little  or no chance of occurring."
