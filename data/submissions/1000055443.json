Topics include general information such items as objectives, hazards, location, equipment needed, P&ID's, task flow diagrams, and step-by-step procedures with specific warnings and comments. The SOPs cover different phases of operations such as: initial startup; normal, temporary and emergency operations; emergency shutdowns; and startup following a shutdown.\r\n\r\nTraining - All employees are who are involved with anhydrous ammonia have been properly trained, at a minimum, in understanding the MSDS, routine refrigeration system operation, emergency refrigeration system operation, emergency and normal refrigeration safety practices, and, if appropriate, the individual's role in the emergency response plan.\r\n\r\nContractors - This site follows strict guidelines for qualifying contractors who directly influence the safety of the process or the system. The contractor qualification procedure ensures that contractors and their employees are fully aware of the potential dangers involved with the ammonia process, that contractors understand their responsibility and train their people, and that a contractor's safety record is considered in reviewing the bids.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Review - Pre-startup safety reviews are required on all new or modified equipment/systems. This involves process safety information, process hazard analysis, training, safety procedures, operating procedures, and verification that construction and equipment are in accord with the design specifications.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Audits - The purpose of the Mechanical Integrity Audit program is to ensure that the equipment is maintained in good working condition. These are performed on all compressors, condensers, evaporators, pressure vessels, piping system, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\r\n\r\nHot Work Perm"

The stationary source is the Zentis North America Operating, LLC located at 2050 North Oak Drive, Plymouth, IN. The site is owned and operated by Meadowbrook Farms. The only RMP regulated substance in this facility is anhydrous ammonia--which is classified as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. This is a first time RMP submission for a new ammonia refrigeration system for a fruit processing facility. The refrigeration system in this facility does not meet the requirements of Program 1. It is subject to OSHA's PSM standard. Therefore, this RMP is written to meet the EPA Program 3 level of compliance.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION POLICY\r\n\r\nThis facility follows a Process Safety Management Program consisting of multiple binders (Volumes Number 1 through 21) to prevent the accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of 29 CFR 1910.119. Employees and management participate and cooperate in the PSM program to maintain a work environment that is safe to employees, the community, and the environment.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\r\n\r\nThe facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. The plan will be provided to the local LEPC for review.\r\n\r\nPROCESS CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\nThe process is the standard refrigeration cycle. It uses anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant. The only substance inside the refrigeration system is ammonia. The process causes the ammonia to boil into a gas and then cool into a liquid and then repeats the process. The refrigeration system lowers the liquid pressure to lower the boiling point and then evaporates the ammonia within the system using room air as the heat source. It then compresses the ammonia into a high pressure/temperature and cools the gas until it condenses. Th"

The ammonia changes state from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid. It does not chemically change; it is not consumed and does not wear out. It continuously circulates throughout the system.\r\n\r\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nThis food processing facility operates a two-temperature, single stage, anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with an engine room capacity of +19\u00b0F high-temperature suction and -30\u00b0F low-temperature action. This refrigeration system is a liquid recirculation system and is designed to operate at an over-feed ratio of approximately 3:1 for all evaporators. \r\n\r\n1 Low temperature system (-30)\r\n2. High temperature system (+19)\r\n3. Condenser system (95\u00b0FCT)\r\n4. Compressor low temperature system (-0)\r\n5. Compressor high temperature system (+19)\r\n\r\nMITIGATION MEASURES\r\n\r\nThere are some mitigating measures in place. The location for the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It also starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program. Various special elements have been incorporated into this program to meet the additional EPA requirements for the RMP. Following is an overview.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation - The Participation Program is an asset to both employees at the site and to the community as a whole. As a general rule, employees who are fully involved have a greater"

These are available to employees that operate, maintain, or repair the process equipment or piping. There are three major categories of information: ammonia data such as MSDS, safety information, first aid, chemical properties, IIAR safety bulletins, etc.; process information such as piping & instrumentation diagrams (P&ID's), block flow diagram, mass flow balance, design codes and standards, pressure safety relief settings, safety system/devices, ventilation system design, operating procedures, safe operating limits, and ramification of process deviation; and process equipment information such as equipment specifications, electrical classifications, materials of construction, installation manuals, operating and maintenance manuals, and manufacturer's manuals. Process Hazard Analysis - A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was completed using the What-if technique. This addressed hazards, engineering and administrative controls, consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls, facility sitting, human factors, and a qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health impact. The results of the PHA were prioritized and incorporated into a PHA Findings Report for follow-up a"

Hot work permits must be obtained before any work is done outside the shop area. The Maintenance Supervisor reviews and issues the permits to insure all fire prevention and protection rules are met. Permits indicate the appropriate dates and the work to be done. The permits are kept on file until workers have completed the hot work operations.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change - The Management of Change (MOC) procedure requires that all changes (even replacement in kind) be reviewed to see if there is a possible negative effect. The MOC review addresses the technical basis for the change, the impact on safety and health, modifications to operating procedures, and authorization requirements for the proposed change. Employees affected by the change are informed of the change before startup and trained in the proper procedures.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation - An incident investigation shall be performed any time there is an incident which resulted in, or which could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of ammonia. The purpose is to gain information that could prevent further accidents and to identify weaknesses in the emergency response plan that need to be addressed. Investigations are initiated promptly using a trained team. The findings and recommendations will be studied and appropriate corrective action taken.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Plan - This facility has a comprehensive emergency response plan that meets established criteria. This plan will be provided to the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits and RMP Revisions - To insure that all the other 12 areas of PSM program are followed, the company requires compliance audits. At a minimum, these must be completed every three years.\r\nResubmission of the RMP shall be done according to the RMP Management pr"
