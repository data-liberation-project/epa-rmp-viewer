In addition, the floors in the Distribution Center buildings are all sloped in order to contain any spill within a building and the internal drains drain to a reservoir which would contain any spill.\n\nEquipment includes catch boxes at the Tank Farm tanker unloading area, as well as the Building #4 unloading area.  Also, vapor monitors with alarms are located at the Tank Farm, within the Distillation Area, within the GR Filling Area, and at the tanker unloading area at Building #4.\n\nAll operators in the Distillation Area, the filling areas, and the tanker receiving areas are thoroughly trained on all operating procedures involving the handling and movement of toxic and flammable materials.  This has been done in accordance within the guidelines of the OSHA Process Safety Management Rule, 29CFR1910.119.  Included in this training is the prevention and mitigation of accidental spills.\n\nAll spills and other incidents at the site are required to be reported and are investigated by an Accident Investigation Team.  The Team is required to present corrective actions, and these corrective actions are tracked.\n\nA Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan has been prepared and is in effect for the facility.\n\nEmegency Response:\nThe site has a HazMat Team on all shifts while there is scheduled production.   This Team is trained and equipped to handle any spill which could occur at the site.  Yearly refresher courses are held, as well as bi-monthly training sessions.

All EMD Chemicals Inc. employees are trained in their responsibilities during emergencies, whether these responsibilities are active or passive.\n\nThe Norwood and Cincinnati Fire Departments are familiar with the facility and scheduled walk-throughs are conducted every other year where they observe first hand the facility and the materials handled.  In addition, the SARA312 is submitted yearly to these two Agencies, as well as the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee, and the Ohio State Emergency Response Commission.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE DESCRIPTION:  The EMD Chemicals Inc. Norwood facility consists of approximately 19 acres located on both the North and South sides of Highland Avenue at 2909 Highland Avenue, and 2910 Highland Avenue.  The operations on the North side include warehousing and distribution of finished goods, as well as offices.\n\nThe operations on the South side include Distillation and packaging of high purity solvents, laboratories, storage of raw materials and packaging supplies, repackaging of dry powders and liquids, waste chemical disposal, warehousing of finished goods, and office functions.  Included in these operations are the receipt and storage of bulk solvents, the receipt of bulk shipments of formaldehyde, and the receipt and storage of finished goods.\n\nRegulated substances handled in excess of threshold limits include Chloroform, Ethyl Ether, Formaldehyde, and  37% Hydrochloric Acid.  Chloroform is received in tank trucks at the Tank Farm and is off-loaded to an underground storage tank.  Ethyl Ether is received at the Tank Farm in tank trucks and is sampled at this location.  The tank truck is then moved to the Building #4 unloading pad where the Ethyl Ether is pumped to the filling area in Building #4.  The Formaldehyde is received in tank trucks at the Building #4 unloading pad, where the tank truck is sampled and unloaded; Formaldehyde is filled in Building #4.  37% Hydrochlori"

This Team is trained to take proper action to reduce as much as possible the hazards to site employees and visitors, the environment, and the public during any release.  There are HazMat Team members on all scheduled work shifts.  Training is done on specific chemical groups, such as flammables, corrosives, oxidizers, etc.\n\nAn excellent relationship, which has been one of mutual help, has been developed with the local and county emergency responders which would be of benefit should a release occur.  Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) have been done on all of the covered operations.  Included in these PHAs was the potential for releases and the process and system modifications to reduce the release potential.\n\nIn addition, a complete site hazard assessment was done by an outside consultant in late 1990 and early 1991.  Several areas for improvement were noted by the consultant and all of these areas have been addressed.  Where it was deemed necessary, corrections and changes were made to reduce the potential for accidents.\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  There have been no accidents at the EMD Chemicals Inc., Norwood, Ohio site during the past five years which meet the required reporting criteria.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Recommended changes from the several PHAs that have been done are continuing to be completed.  It is our plan to complete in 2004 all of the items which have the highest probability/severity ranking.

Any suggested changes noted by any employee are made a matter of concern and are reviewed to see if any improvements can and should be made.  In addition, the Program includes monthly Department Safety Meetings, scheduled Safety Audits of each department, a Site Safety Committee with monthly meetings, and a Review Board which meets monthly to formulate overall safety policy."
