Risk Management Plan - Executive Summary Facility Policy: The management and employees operating each of our facilities are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of hazardous material transported or stored on our locations. In the event an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department(s), Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. Facility Information - The NAICS code we feel most applicable for this activity is NAICS code \"424910 Farm Supplies Merchant Wholesalers\". Anhydrous Ammonia is the only product at this facility subject to EPA Risk Management Planning at this time. Anhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application to farm fields during the early spring and fall months. During the balance of the year little if any product transfer occurs. The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank. The facility is operated on an \"as needed\" basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery. Total annual hours for these needs do not meet the 2,080 hour requirement to qualify as a \"full time employee\" on site therefore item number 1.11 is Zero. Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times of day and night throughout the year. Time expended for these inspections is not included in our staffing calculation. Worst-case release scenario: The \"worst-case release scenario\" is considered to be the release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank. The maximum quantity released based on 85 % tank capacity as limited by design standards, the distance to the endpoint (point of di"

Alternative release scenario: There has not been an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site. We believe the most likely release would be caused by damage to the liquid valve on a nurse tank due to a transportation incident. This could lead to the total loss of contents of the tank. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is determined per instructions by EPA guidance. Accidental Release Program: Our Anhydrous Ammonia accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K61.1-1999 \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". We conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to: Excess flow valves, Breakaway couplers at risers, Emergency shut-off valves, Barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and Lock outs to prevent tampering when the site is unattended. We also maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Ammonia. We have developed an Emergency Action Plan for employees, customers, and visitor protection in event of fire, explosion, tornado, and other acts of god that require evacuation, emergency medical care, contacts for assistance, etc. for all areas of our company including the Anhydrous Ammonia facility included in this plan. The primary emergency coordinator is listed"

Five - Year Accident History: There has not been a release of anhydrous ammonia within the past five years that has caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility or to our knowledge has resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. Emergency Response Program: This facility is included in the written MN required incident response plan. We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA Standard 29CFR 1910.38. We have provided State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA). Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure they conform to the community plan(s). We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia and Propane training programs by the local fire department(s), local emergency response team, community planners, etc. that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site. Planned changes to improve safety: Safety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time."
