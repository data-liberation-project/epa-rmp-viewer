Employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses ammonia proof goggles, gloves, and respirators, as well as, assurance plenty of emergency safety water is available during maintenance operations.\r\n\r\nWith the aforementioned training in mind, it makes it very easy to report that absolutely no injury actions or property damage has occurred at this facility for the past 5 years.  \r\n\r\nOur emergency action plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and the area first responders.
