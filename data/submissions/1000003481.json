The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment.  The City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances but in the event of a release, our trained personnel and local emergency response agencies will respond to control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injuries to the public or the environment.\n\n\n2.0    Description of The City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility and Regulated Substances\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility handles one substance regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity.  This substance is:\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for disinfection of the water prior to distribution.\n\n\n\n3.0    Hazard Assessment\n \nThe RMP Rule requires The City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n \n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the toxic substance chlorine for the chlorination process unit at the facility.\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n4.0    Accid"

The following details the prevention program elements at The City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility that apply to these processes.\n\n4.1    Safety Information\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help ensure safe operation of The City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility processes.  Material safety data sheets (MSDSs) document the physical and chemical properties of hazardous substances handled at The City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility, including the chlorine in the covered process.  The engineering design documents include the operating parameters, the design basis and configuration of the equipment in each covered process, and references to applicable codes and standards.\n\n\n4.2    Hazard Review\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility performs and periodically updates hazard reviews of the covered processes to help identify and control process hazards.  Checklists are used to guide the hazard review.  These checklists include items to help ensure The City of Cleburne Wastewater Treatment Plant operates and maintains the equipment in a manner consistent with the applicable design specifications, codes, standards, and regulations.\n\n4.3    Operating Procedures\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility develops and maintains operating procedures to define how tasks related to process operations should be performed.  The operating procedures are used to:\n\n1. train employees and contractors, and\n2. serve as reference guides for appropriate actions to take during both normal and abnormal process conditions.\n\n4.4    Training\n\nThe City of Cleburne Water Reuse Facility trains personnel in the operating procedures to help ensure safe and effective performance of their assigned tasks. A record of all training is maintai"
