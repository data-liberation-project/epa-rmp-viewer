To help us achieve a workplace that is safe and free from hazards (i.e., chemical releases), we have developed different safety programs and policies.  The QTF Foods processing plant uses ammonia as a refrigerant, which is considered hazardous by OSHA & the EPA.  Because of the hazardoous properties associated with ammonia it is necessary to observe the many safety precautions in the handling of ammonia in our processes.  It is QTF's policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations while using guidance to best management practices as established by the Industrial Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR).  Safe handling of ammonia is the result of safety features built into the system, along with the training and safe handling procedures observed by our refrigeration personnel.\n     The QTF Food's emergency response to a accidental chemical release is based on OSHA's requirements for emergency action & response planning.  We have our own Hazardous Materials Response Team and have incorporated standard operating procedures in the unlikely event of an accidental release.\n\nDescription of the facility & the regulated substance handled.\n\n     The Quik-to-Fix Foods, Sioux Center Plant is part of an independent, value-added meat company with a long and successful history of supplying products to foodservice operators through a national distribution system.  The regulated substance used at our location is ammonia.  Ammonia, due to its environmental friendliness, economic and energy efficiencies is used within a closed system as a refrigerant for temperature control and product freezing.  Access to our processes is restricted to authorized manage"

      "SummaryText": "ment personnel, plant employees and contractors.\n     The maximum amount of ammonia that can be stored at this plant is 17,000 lbs.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\n     Failure of our largest storage vessel when filled to the greatest amount allowed would result in the release of 4,800 lbs. of ammonia.  The amount of ammonia released from the storage vessel, enclosed in a ventilated room, would be in liquid form which would vaporize into the surrounding atmosphere.  Ammonia has a strong, pungent odor and is colorless in a gas or liquid state.  Ammonia is not considered flammable but upon reaching a determined level of concentration within an enclosed space can be explosive.\n     The distance to endpoint under the worst case conditions, ammonia could travel 1 mile before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This was determined using EPA's RMP*Comp program.\n\nAltermative Case Scenario\n\n     Due to possible over pressurization within the ammonia system, a relief valve system is used and designed to release any pressure build up to the atmosphere.  This system prevents an over pressure situation which may cause vessel or pipe failure.  Ammonia released through the relief valve system would be of vapor form.  Relief valves are designed to close when the over pressurization situation is controlled which can be done manually or through computer controls.\n     The distance to endpoint for the alternative scenario is calculated at 1100 ft.  This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility boundary.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\n\n     The ammonia system within the Sioux Center Plant is in compliance with OSHA's Process Safety Management and EPA's Risk Management Program.  IIAR guidelines are implemented in the processes.  Key to the prevention program is our backup systems and computer controls.  Operating procedures have been established to maintain a consistent and safe system.  The engin"

Emergency response includes assembly of our in-house Hazardous Materials Response Team.  This is a team of individuals trained for containment and isolation during an ammonia release.  This team works closely with and has conducted joint training and emergency drills with the local fire department and emergency planning coordinator.  Efforts to alert affected community members is coordinated through Hazmat personnel and these local agencies.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\n\n     At present the computer system, controlling the ammonia system is being updated to ensure better process controls.  Hazmat and refrigeration personnel are continually learning new system controls and design improvements through training and outside agencies such as our ammonia contractor and IIAR."
