              "Description": "BP America Production Company - Pascagoula Gas Plant (\"facility\" or \"refinery\") views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its people, the local community, and the integrity of process equipment.  The following sections will provide an overview of the various elements of the facility's PSM program.\n\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe cornerstone of the PSM program is Process Safety Information (PSI).  PSI defines the chemical hazards, equipment, and technology in a given process.  Maintaining the PSI enables the facility employees involved in operating the covered processes to identify and understand the hazards posed by such processes involving OSHA OSM Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the facility documents safety-related-limits for parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process documents.  The facility provides a means of maintaining the processes within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems, such as automated shutdown systems.\n\n\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature rating, and electrical rating of equipment.  In combination with written procedures and trained personnel, this information facilitates that the safety features in the process are not compromised and provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes.\n\n\n\nPROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\n\n\nThe facility primarily uses the Hazards and Operability Study (HAZOP) PHA methodology to perform these evaluations.  This methodology is often used in combination with the Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) technique.  HAZOP methodology is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, and engineering experience.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures, if applicable. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help minimize the potential that process controls and/or process hazards could eventually deviate significantly from the original designed safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operational.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained for the life of the facility.\n\n\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3)temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are required to be reviewed and certified annually as current and accurate.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the facility maintains key process parameter documents that provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTRAINING\n\n\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing their training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) possessing adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to maintain their skills and knowledge at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n\n\nMECHANICAL INTEGRITY\n\n\n\nThe facility has well-established procedures for and practices to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, process controls, pumps and compressors, emergency shutdown systems, and critical instrument systems in a safe operating condition.  The mechanical integrity program includes (1)conducting training for maintenance personnel, (2) developing written procedures so that work is performed in a consistent manner and provides a basis for training, (3) ongoing inspection and testing of various types of process equipment to verify the equipment functions as intended and is within acceptable limits, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, if applicable, and (5) quality assurance measures to verify the equipment?s suitability for the process application for which they will be used.\n\n  \n\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\n\n\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its covered processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures and other changes to stationary sources that affect a covered proces be properly reviewed an authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by change, and (3)verify that modifications to operating limits and procedures, chemical hazard information, and equipment information have been updated.  In addition, the procedure includes a step for informing and training employees involved in operating the process and maintenance employees whose job tasks will be affected by a change in the process. \n\n\n\nPRE-STARTUP REVIEW\n\n\n\nThe facility conducts a pre-startup safety review (PSSR) for any new process or facility modification that requires a change in PSI.  The purpose of the PSSR is to confirm that (1) construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications and are field verified, (2) supporting systems are operationally ready, (3) safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency and accident prevention procedures are in place, adequate, and properly implemented, and (4) training of each employee involved in operating the process has been completed.  The PSSR review team uses checklist to verify all aspects of readiness. \n\n\n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the facility will periodically conduct a compliance audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  The facility?s performance relative to the provisions of 40 CFR 68 is required to be evaluated at least once every three years, with the RMP Compliance audit teams findings developed in a report.  The audit team, consisting of both hourly and staff personnel, develops findings that are forwarded to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team?s findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent compliance audit reports are required to be retained.    \n\n\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\nThe facility promptly investigates all RMP incidents that resulted in, or could have resulted in an RMP incident involving fire, explosion, material release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years so that reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.     \n\n\n\nEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION\n\n\n\nThe facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  The facility's written employee participation plan outlines the various ways that employees can participate, including, but not limited to, the following activities: (1) Regularly scheduled safety meetings; (2) Update and compile technical documents and chemical information; (3) Become a member of PHA teams; (4) Form teams to promote process and personal safety; and (5) MOC program.  In addition, all employees have access to PHAs and all other information required to be developed for RMP.\n\n  \n\nHOT WORK PERMITS\n\n\n\nThe facility has a hot work permit practice in place for all work performed at or near covered process areas.  The intent of the hot work permit is to confirm the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and safety measures are being utilized before the work begins.  The permit must document that the OSHA fire prevention and/or chemical protection requirements have been implemented prior to beginning the hot work operations.  The permit should specify the dates on which the work is authorized and identify the specific process/equipment on which hot work is to be performed.  All permits should be kept on file until the workers have completed the hot work operations.\n\n\n\nCONTRACTORS\n\n\n\nThe facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  The contractor safety program includes a contractor selection process and a Contractor Safety Element Coordinator/Director.  Before selecting contractors to perform any work on or near covered process areas, the safety performance of the contractor and contractor safety programs are evaluated.  \n\n\n\nIn addition to performing their work in a safe manner, contractors should (1) utilize the appropriate knowledge and skills to understand the process, (2) recognize potential safety and health hazards in their workplace, (3) inform plant personnel of any hazards identified while working, (4)understand what to do in an emergency situation using the emergency response plan, and (5) understand and follow site safety rules and safe work practices.  Verification that the contractor is fulfilling his or her responsibilities and is abiding to all relevant safety programs and procedures should be monitored periodically by responsible facility personnel.  \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE \n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan (ERP), which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire and/or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.

Enterprise Products purchased this facility from BP and assumed operational control of PGP on June 1, 2016.  The facility receives raw natural gas from deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, and then separates that gas into its components.  The raw natural gas passing through the plant contains the following regulated substances: methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, pentane, and isopentane.  This natural gas is processed for distribution throughout major pipelines in the Southeast and is provided to customers throughout the Southeast and all along the East Coast.   \n\n \n\nThe facility's risk management program and maximum chemical inventory were evaluated and it was determined that the facility's processes render the facility subject to 40 CFR 68 requirements.  Moreover, the processes render the facility subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) - Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, codified in 29 CFR 1910.119.  As such, the terminal is subject to RMP Prevention Program 3 requirements.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains a management system and associated policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs, and work practices that are related to RMP Prevention Program elements.  These policies, procedures, standing instructions, programs and work practices are measures that are designed to help the site identify planned changes, which vary at any given time, and are designed to further enhance the facility's existing safety programs and procedures.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nEnterprise Products views the health and safety of its employees and the community in which it operates as its top priority.  The Enterprise Products  facility has implemented a robust OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program to protect its peopl"
