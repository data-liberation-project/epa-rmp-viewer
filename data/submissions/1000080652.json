      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nLower Bucks County Joint Municipal Authority (LBCJMA) owns, operates and maintains a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). LBCJMA accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices. All Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to. LBCJMAA?s Emergency Response Policy Plans are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response service available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.\n\n\n\nThe chlorination system has been installed at LBCJMA to disinfect WWTP effluent prior to its discharge into the Delaware River, as per LBCJMA National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit.  LBCJMA WWTP serves Tullytown Borough and portions of Bristol Township, Middletown Township and Falls Township. The chlorination facility is located within the LBCJMA WWTP. The chlorination facility includes a chlorine cylinder weighing room, which contains liquid chlorine cylinders (four one-ton cylinders), and a chlorine feeding room, which contains two (2) chlorinator and electric panels. At any given time under normal operational conditions, a one-ton chlorine cylinder is turned on in the chlorine cylinder weighing room. The chlorine cylinder is connected to a manifold, which transports chlorine to the chlorinators. Chlorine gas flow to the manifold is controlled by a valve; at each cylinder and one at the manifold. Generally, there are six (6) cylinders, which are stored in a chlorine cylinder storage area.  The chlorination facility is normally unmanned. The WWTP operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur. There are four 150 pounds cylinder stored near the Return Activated Sludge building to feed chlorine to Return Activated Sludge line under only emergency conditions   to control growth of undesirable foam producing fil"

All these cylinders are stored in a locked enclosure and all cylinders are completely shut off.  \n\n      \n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two (2) chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case scenario\" and \"alternative scenario\". The EPA has defined a worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a specified endpoint. In case of vessels, need to only consider the largest amount in the vessel, regardless of interconnections with pipes and other vessels. For the consequence analysis, the total quantity in the single largest vessel process line is assumed to be released as a gas over a period of 10 minutes. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\n\n\n\nEPA's RMP*Comp was used to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreased to the \"toxic endpoint\" selected by EPA of 0.0087 mg/l or 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health affected or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario at LBCJMA WWTP Chlorination Facility involves a failure of the one-ton cylinder (a total of 2,000 lbs of chlorine) as only one-ton cylinder is on at any given time  under normal operation. The offsite consequence analysis for this scenario was performed for the set of conditions pre-defined by EPA, namel"

EPA set these conditions to facilitate the performance of the offsite consequence analysis.  EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely Stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec., temperature of 25A? C (77A?F) and humidity of 50% were used.\n\n\n\nWhen analysis of the worst-case scenario was performed using the EPA's RMP*Comp and using the EPA assumptions and considering the chlorine gas is in an enclosed space, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles was obtained. It was determined that there is an estimated residential population of 6,454 within the 0.9 mile radius.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves rupture of the flexible connection (pigtails) or pipe possibly due to corrosion. The analysis of the alternative case scenario was performed using EPA's RMP*Comp. The amount of chlorine released (considering it was released in an enclosed space) is 2,000 pounds, at an average rate over one hour (the duration of the release) of 34 lb/min. Toxic endpoint distance to ERPG-2 levels was obtained. The typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed 3 m/s, average air temperature of 25A?C and 50% average humidity. The estimated distance to the toxic endpoints of 0.1 miles was determined for the ERPG-2. An estimated residential population of 102 was determined to be within the 0.1 mile radius.\n\n\n\nSince the chlorine cylinder weighing room and the chlorine feeding system/chlorinators are located within the rooms, enclosure is considered as a passive mitigation system. Actuation of the chlorine detector is an active mitigation measure considered.\n\n\n\nThe general LBCJMA WWTP accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n High level of training of the operators and mechanics\n\n Preventive "
