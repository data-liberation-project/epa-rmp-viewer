Early Terminal received anhydrous ammonia from pipeline and dispenses anhydrous ammonia to tank trucks for fertilizer application.  Both of the transfer processes are accomplished with ammonia transfer pumps.  The Early Terminal also stores liquid anhydrous ammonia in two pressure vessels and two aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) within its facility.  \n\nThe liquid anhydrous ammonia stored in the pressure vessels are pressurized under atmospheric temperature.  One of the pressure vessels has a capacity of 66 tons and the other has a capacity of 200 tons.  A maximum of 266 tons of anhydrous ammonia could be stored in these pressure vessels.  The liquid anhydrous ammonia stored in the ASTs is refrigerated under atmospheric pressure.  Each AST has a capacity of 40,000 tons, so the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia which can be \nstored in the ASTs is 80,000 tons.  \n\nRationale for Risk Management Program Development, Implementation, and Update\n\nThe 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) require Environmental protection Agency EPA) to issue a rule specifying the type of actions to be taken by facilities to prevent accidental releases of substances into the atmosphere and reduce their potential impact on the public and the environment.  As the results of the 1990 Amendments, EPA issued the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (part 68 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)) that requires affected facilities to develop and implement a risk management program.  The affected facilities include any facilities that handle, manufacture, store, or use above the specified threshold quantities of toxic substances in a process, including ammonia.  The threshold quantities for ammonia to trigger the development and implementation of a risk management program are 10,000 pounds.\n\nThe risk management program is designed to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause seriou"

Since Agrium is handling more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia, it is required to develop and implement a risk management program.  To comply with the RMP rules, Agrium implemented an RMP program at the Early Terminal and submitted an RMP to EPA in 1999.  The Agrium's risk management program includes an offsite consequence analysis of a potential accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nThe RMP rules required that the RMP be updated at least every five years.  Agrium is updating the RMP for the Early Terminal to comply with the rules.  \n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe five-year accident history involves an examination of the effects of any accidental releases of \nanhydrous ammonia in the five years prior to the RMP update.  The five-year accident history \ncovers:\n\n\t- the release of ammonia from Agrium's facility.\n\t- the release that caused at least one of the following:\n        - On site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (40 CFR \n          part 68.42(a)); or\n        - known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental \n          damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (40 CFR Part 68.42\n          (a)).\n\nDuring the last five years, the Early Terminal has had no releases that caused death, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage either on or off site.\n\nRelease Prevention Program\n\nAgrium has a Release Prevention Program (RPP) in placed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials at this facility.  The RPP include:\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nAgrium has developed and will keep current working copies of the PSI including information pertaining to the hazards of the process, the technology of the process, and equipment of the process.  All employees are trained in the operation of the entire terminal and all contractors"

The incident will also be input into a computer program celled \nIncidEnter that ties to the Agrium corporate office.  The leader of the incident investigation team is knowledgeable of the plant and have received formal training in incident investigation.  There were no incidents at the Early Terminal for the last five years.\n\t\nCompliance Audit\nA compliance audit of the Agrium facility will be conducted at least every three (3) years to evaluate compliance of Agrium's process with the release prevention program (RPP).  The audit team will include one person knowledgeable in audit skills and techniques and team members with appropriate technical expertise.  \n\t\nManagement of Change (MOC)\nAgrium's MOC system was developed to ensure that changes at Agrium will not result in undetected unsafe situations and employees will be aware of all changes and their implications.  The Agrium's MOC system includes the following considerations before any changes take place:\n\t\n- the authorization requirements for the change.\n- the technical basis for the proposed change\n- the impact of the change on health and safety.\n- the necessary time for the change.\n- required modification to Operating Procedures.\n\t\nAfter changes are made, all employees will be informed about the change and training will be provided to the employees prior to startup of the modified process.  In addition, the PSI and OP will be updated to reflect the changes made.  No changes were made to the Early Terminal for the last five years.\n\t\nPre-Startup Review (PSR)\nWhen change to the process is significant enough to require a change in safety information under the MOC, Agrium will conduct a PSR.  The PSR Team Leader will develop a checklist and assemble team of key personnel to go over every element on the checklist during the PSR.  All PSR team members will be knowledgeable about the process and trained i"
