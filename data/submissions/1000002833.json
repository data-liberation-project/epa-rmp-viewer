This update is the facility's mandatory five-year update as required in 40 CFR Part 68.190.\n\nAt General Chemical's Syracuse Works, one listed chemical, Anhydrous Ammonia, is managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria (according to applicability thresholds listed in 40 CFR Part 68.10). No chemicals are managed on-site under program level 1 or program level 2 criteria.\n\nThis RMP executive summary describes Syracuse Work's risk management program which includes a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The release prevention and emergency response programs at this site were developed based on requirements from the CAA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119). \n\n* Section 1.0 - Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n* Section 2.0 - Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n* Section 3.0 - General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n* Section 4.0 - Five Year Accident History\n* Section 5.0 - Emergency Response Program \n* Section 6.0 - Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGeneral Chemical LLC recognizes that the responsible management of health, safety and the environment in and around its facilities is one of its highest corporate priorities and a key element in its successful business strategy. General Chemical LLC is committed to implementing policies and procedures which confirm that its operations are cond"

Achieving responsible health, safety and environmental management will be accomplished by: operating our facilities safely and prudently; efficiently using energy and materials; seeking ways to minimize or reuse wastes; and otherwise complying fully with known applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n2.0  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nGeneral Chemical's Syracuse Works manufactures Sodium Nitrite.  The process of producing Sodium Nitrite requires Anhydrous Ammonia to be used as a raw material. Sodium Nitrite has a broad range of applications.  For example, it is used as a corrosion inhibitor, and a meat-curing agent.  It is also used in the production of textile dyes, rubber compounds, and charcoal briquettes.\n \nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by the Syracuse facility as a pressurized liquid in rail cars and is unloaded into two storage tanks.\n\n3.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and foster safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Syracuse Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n* Process Safety Information - Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.\n\n* Mechanical Integrity - Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.\n\n* Process Hazard Analysis - Processes are routinely analyzed to identify and correct potential hazards, as well as increase the safety of the ope"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our program with the Onondaga County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee which is comprised of local government officials, local emergency response officials, and industry representatives.  Syracuse Works, the LEPC and local fire departments have coordinated communication to notify the public quickly, if necessary, as well as facilitate quick resp"
