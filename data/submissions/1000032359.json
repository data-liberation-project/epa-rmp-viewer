These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nE.  Training\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Mobile Bay plant utilizes task progressing experience as a means for operator growth and advancement.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g. Through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and task in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nF.  Contractors\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay plant uses contractors to supplement its workforces during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

The plant handles natural gas and natural gas liquids (which contain methane, ethane, propane, and other like materials).  The EPA considers these materials hazardous (flammable).  Because they are flammable it is necessary to handle them with certain safety precautions.  Mobile Bay has a strong commitment to employee safety, protecting the environment, and community advancement.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as extensive employee training and a standard practice to incorporate safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility.  Additional safety precautions include safety systems such as alarms, shutdowns, and overpressure relief valves.  These safety precautions provide protection for our employees' health and welfare and provide safeguards for the public and environment.  It is our policy to comply with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to implementing EPA's Risk Management Program to protect the public and the environment, the Mobile Bay Plant has implemented the fourteen (14) elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program to insure facility and process safety.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notifying local, state, and federal agencies, as well as adjacent business.  Local officials including our LEPC have reviewed our emergency response plan.  The Mobile Bay employees receive training covering these procedures.\r\n\r\n2.

The general accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the Mobile Bay plant that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the fourteen (14) OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nA. Employee Participation\r\n\r\nMobile Bay plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from tailoring, compiling, and updating plant operating procedures and participating in process hazard analysis (PHA) of new or modified processes.  Employees have access to all vital information pertaining to plant operations.  In addition, the plant institutes various ways to get employees involved.  One such way is the formation of the safety committee.  This committee focuses on safety issues related to the Mobile Bay plant.  The committee is made up of employees from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, and management.\r\n\r\nB.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nC.  Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay plant has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe facility primarily uses the What-if/Checklist method for identifying hazards.  Secondarily, the hazard analysis and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique may also be used.  The analyses are conducted using a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process a well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when they believe such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nD.

The emergency response plan will be reviewed annually with employees unless changes have occurred, which will be communicated immediately.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay plant participates in meetings with the LEPC, Mobile Fire-Rescue Department, Mobile County EMS, Life Flight Aeromedical Services, and Transco Station 82 (receptor) at the facility.  These meetings consist of a review of our emergency operation procedures as well as opportunities to participate in a tabletop exercise to discuss sequences of events during an emergency and the roles of responding agencies.\r\n\r\n6.  Planned changes in improving safety.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay plant recently upgraded its LEL atmospheric monitoring abilities in an effort to better recognize the presence of hydrocarbons in and around the Product Booster Pumps.  Proper maintenance procedures have also been put in place to maintain these sensors according to the manufacturer's recommendations.  The Mobile Bay plant has completed a facility siting project that included adding structural reinforcement to the North wall of the Control Building, improving the current HVAC to a positive pressure HVAC system with additional exhaust fans and additional gas detection sensors.  This is in an effort to provide better protection for employees.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay plant will continue to strive toward system upgrades in an effort to increase overall plant safety."

Management of Change\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.  The system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, procedures, and equipment information are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.\r\n\r\nK.  Incident Investigation\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Bay plant investigates all incidents according to SIP Guidelines resulting in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, gas release, major property damage, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for review.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and made known to all employees.\r\n\r\nL.  Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nCompliance audits are conducted to ensure procedures and practices are followed.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three (3) years.\r\n\r\n4.
