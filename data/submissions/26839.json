Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Silveredge Coop in Strawberry Point, IA are strongly committed to employee, public, and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance,\n\nand employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement\n\nappropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our\n\nresponse efforts with the Strawberry Point Fire Department, which provides additional emergency\n\nresponse expertise.\n\n\n\n  2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous\n\nammonia stored in two stationary storage tanks [one @ 18,000 gallons; one @ 12,000 gallons] at our\n\nfacility in Strawberry Point (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 516,000 pounds including\n\nthe capacity of the on-site nurse tanks.  The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains\n\n84,000 pounds at 89% maximum storage capacity.\n\n\n\n  3. Worst Case Release and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nWe utilized EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations for worst case scenarios\n\n(according to Jeff Eichenberger, Ag Products Inspector, IDALS) and RMPComp for the alternate\n\ncase scenarios of the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility.  The following details\n\nthese scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the \n\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (80,000  pounds) in gaseous form over a 10-minute period.

Any findings from the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely\n\nmanner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSilveredge Coop maintains written operating procedures to ensure that activities within our covered\n\nprocesses are conducted safely.  These procedures address various modes of operation; the\n\ninformation is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n\n(Appendix B).\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nSilveredge Coop has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are\n\noperating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nSilveredg"

Maintenance checks are conducted by qualified personnel with previous training in\n\nmaintenance practices.  Examples of process equipment that would receive maintenance checks\n\ninclude:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency\n\nshutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance\n\nchecks are corrected in a safe and timely manner (Appendix C).\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Silveredge Coop to manage changes in process chemicals,\n\ntechnology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other\n\nemployees whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly notified\n\nof the modification and offered training to deal with it.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nSilveredge Coop routinely conducts pre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and\n\nmodifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction,\n\nequipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing\n\nequipment into operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSilveredge Coop conducts compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the plan's\n\nprovisions, set out under the 40 CFR part 68, are being implemented.  Any non-compliance issue\n\ndiscovered during the audit is promptly corrected.\n\n     \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nSilveredge Coop truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team\n\neffort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident\n\nprevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to all\n\ninformation created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP, particularly information\n\nresulting from process hazard analyses.\n\n\n\n  5.
