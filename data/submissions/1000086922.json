Our goals are to have no accidents, no harm to people, and no damage to the environment.  It is our commitment to provide a working environment that is safe by identifying hazards; designing and constructing our facilities according to recognized standards, procedures, and management systems; operating and maintaining facilities within the  current design envelope; carefully selecting and training our workforce; managing changes to the organization personnel, systems, procedures, and equipment; and maintaining emergency management plans to identify equipment, training, and personnel necessary to protect the workforce, public, and environment in the event of an incident.\r\n\r\nDescription of Facilities/Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Stratton Ridge facility is a hydrocarbon feedstock storage and distribution terminal consisting of ten (10) underground storage caverns and associated product conditioning and transmission facilities. The salt dome caverns are used to store ethylene, propylene, butenes, and mixtures of ethane and propane.  All hydrocarbon feedstocks are transported into and out of the site by pipeline.   The facility stores flammable materials consisting of ethane, propane, ethylene, propylene, and butenes.  These are present in both pure form and mixtures. There is some above-ground processing of material, including drying and compression. The facility handles no toxic substances as defined by Table 1 or Table 2 of 40 CFR 68.130 over threshold quantities.\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Emergency Management is managed through the Stratton Ridge Operations Superintendent at INEOS Chocolate Bayou (CBW) Facility located approximately 20 miles North on FM 2004.  \r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility is"

      "SummaryText": "subject to Program 3 prevention requirements of the EPA RMP Rule, and to the OSHA PSM Rule upon which those requirements were based.  The facility reduces the possibility of a fire or explosion through several mechanisms.  Process Hazard Analysis/Layers of Protection Analysis (PHAs/LOPAs) are done on a routine schedule for the process, and any change goes through the site's Management of Change (MOC) process which includes a hazard review before it is operated.  The plant has an ongoing inspection program based on American Petroleum Institute (API) Standards.  Automatic shutoff valves are used on storage caverns, in accordance with the governing Railroad Commission of Texas.  Training programs and operating maintenance procedures are also routinely reviewed.  Operators are trained and certified initially and on a three year interval.  The facility has strict policies on controlling hazardous energy during maintenance activities.    In the event of an upset, the facility has relief valves which are sent to a flare.  For work that is performed by a contractor, procedures are in place to evaluate the contractor prior to work and evaluate the contractor's performance on an ongoing basis.  The plant reduces the possibility that a source of ignition might be present by maintaining hot work procedures and through proper classification of electrical equipment.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe plant has had no releases in the past five years that resulted in an injury to personnel, significant property damage, nor any off-site impacts.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Stratton Ridge Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Our facility promotes employee participation through different established safety programs: VPP (Voluntary Protection Program), ESALT (Employee Safety Action and Leadership Team), PSC (Process Safety Committee), ERT (Emergency Response Team) amongst others.

The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards; limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories; and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The facility has documentation available showing the location of unit specific information to help employees, contractors and visitors locate any necessary process safety information. \r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (i.e. temperature, level, composition).  The plant assures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (i.e., automated shutdown s"

Information is available to employees summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take.\r\n\r\nThe plant also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes but is not limited to materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each part of the process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Stratton Ridge Facility primarily uses the What If/Checklist analysis technique along with the Layer of Protection (LOPA) Analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The What If/Checklist analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques which is complemented with the LOPA technique which is a semi-quantitative risk analysis. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PHA team's recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These recommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tra"

The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Stratton Ridge Facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years as long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to management.  Final resolution of the recommendations is tracked, documented, and retained.  \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are developed/revised by experienced operators, supervisors and engineers as needed and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are revised as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\r\n\r\nSafe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower exceedences for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the written operating procedures, is readily available to the process operators and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, an"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Stratton Ridge Facility has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every three years.  All of this training is documented, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency re"

Stratton Ridge Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Plant personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nThe Stratton Ridge Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.  For small minor changes, completion of an abbreviated PSSR is done prior to implementation of the change.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Stratton Ridge Facility has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures and plans, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits.  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or an MOC team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Stratton Ridge Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \r\n\r\n\r\nHot Work Permit\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility has a hot work permit program which details those activities which require a permit and those activities for which a hot work permit is not required.  A hot work permit is required in process areas for all cutting, welding, spark producing equipment, etc. except in designated free burn areas outside of the process unit.  The procedure includes accountability and responsibility for authorizing and issuing a hot work permit; display of the hot work permit at the site of the hot work until the hot work is completed; site inspection; designation of appropriate precautions to be taken with the hot work; and assignment of a fire watch where appropriate.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.

In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nStratton Ridge Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.   The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts, identify the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents their findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
