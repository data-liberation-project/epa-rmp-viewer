Like Samson, Empresa has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facilityA?s processes.  Empresa is dedicated to implementing reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nEmpresa operates the Benton Separation Facility located in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.  Benton is a natural gas processing plant that produces liquefied natural gas (LNG) by mechanical refrigeration with water removal by glycol dehydration.  The LNG, a mixture of ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and C6+ compounds, is stored in a pressurized bullet tank for transportation by truck.  A level switch is installed on the bullet tank, which provides a shut in on the compressor and refrigeration unit and calls out the operator in the event of a high level situation.  Condensate and produced water is also stored onsite prior to transportation from the site via tanker trucks.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program, Benton is a Program 2 RMP process.\n\n\n\nOperations at Benton were evaluated while owned by Samson to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity.  All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process.

None of these processes or operations of the facility have changed as a result of the recent change in ownership.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nBenton has not had any accidental releases which meet the criteria outlined in 40 CFR 68.42(a).\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at Benton:  \n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nEmpresa actively encourages all employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment.   This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all employees regarding covered process information.  Employees are involved in maintaining RMP rule compliance based on their knowledge, skill, job responsibilities, and experience.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\n\n\nEmpresa maintains written information intended to provide a foundation for identifying and understanding the process hazards.  This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as key process parameter limits and equipment design basis/configuration information.    \n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the safety data sheets (SDSs) of the materials being used at the facility to which employees could potentially be exposed.  In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems.\n\n\n\nHazard Review and Analysis\n\n\n\nEmpresa has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematicall"

The checklist used in the Hazard Review was provided by persons knowledgeable about the process.  Based on the answers to the questions, consequences and preliminary recommendations can be determined.\n\n\n\nThe Hazard Review findings are promptly and systematically addressed.  Empresa assures that the recommendations are documented and resolved in a timely manner.  This documentation includes the actions to be taken and a written schedule of completion dates.   All Hazard Review findings are communicated with Empresa employees and contractors that may be affected. \n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years by the Hazard Review team.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Benton facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) initial startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) emergency operations, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and certified as current.  When a process change occurs, operating procedures are revised as necessary. \n\n\n\nTraining\n\n\n\nTo complement the written process operating procedures, Empresa continues implementing a comprehensive training program for all employees.  New employees receive job specific basic training in plant operations.  Employee training includes emphasis on safety and health hazards, emergency shutdown operat"
