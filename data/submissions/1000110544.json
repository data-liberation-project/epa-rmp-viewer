The District\u0092s accidental\nrelease prevention strategy incorporates operator training, periodic audits, standard operating\nprocedures, regularly scheduled maintenance, management practices, continuous system\nmonitoring, and current technology to achieve its goals. Additionally, applicable provisions of\nFederal, State, and Local regulations are followed to ensure compliance and prevention of\naccidental releases.\nIn the unlikely event of a release, this plan addresses the response to emergencies by the District and coordination with response agencies that may be involved. In addition, the District has prepared an Emergency Response Plan to address an alarm scenario. Training includes\ninstruction on using emergency response equipment and following proper procedures in the\nevent of a chlorine release. A copy of the Emergency Response Plan is included as Appendix A.\n\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(b)]\n\nThe District operates a Drinking Water Chlorination Facility that adds chlorine gas to groundwater that is pumped from the Coyote Valley Basin. Chlorine gas is injected at the wellhead before the groundwater enters the distribution system.\nThe Drinking Water Chlorination Facility is a small structure that stores chlorine cylinders and\nhouses equipment that controls and supplies the chlorine gas to the wellhead. The maximum of\nthree 150-pound chlorine gas cylinders on site at any one time is permissible. These cylinders can be full or empty. Two cylinders are connected to the chlorination system and one is in reserve. When the pressure in the active cylinder falls below 20 pounds per square inch (psi), an automatic switchover system places the reserve cylinder online while allowing the first cylinder to depressurize to ambient pre"

Pressurized chlorine gas flows through the cylinder valve directly into the\nchlorinator.\n\nNote: There is no pressurized piping between the cylinder valve and the chlorinator.\n\nThe chlorinator reduces the chlorine gas pressure to less than atmospheric and regulates the\nchlorine gas flow rate. Chlorine gas under a negative air pressure flows through piping passing\nthrough the automatic switchover system, a gas flow measuring device, and to the ejector where it is mixed with the groundwater.\nNote: A more detailed description of the process with diagrams is provided in the Chlorine System Operating Procedures included in Appendix B.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Specific Prevention Steps\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(c)]\n\nThe District has in place the following general strategies to help prevent the release of chlorine\ngas:\n\u0095 Regularly scheduled maintenance of the chlorine system\n\u0095 A defined management system that defines roles and responsibilities\n\u0095 Written operating and emergency procedures\n\u0095 Readily available information to plant operators\n\u0095 Training for gas handling and use of emergency repair kits\n\u0095 Continuous system monitoring\n\u0095 A proactive incident investigation process\n\nThe Five-Year Accident History\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(d)]\n\nNo accidental chlorine releases have occurred at the Drinking Water Chlorination Facility in the\npast five-years that have resulted in any of the following:\n\u0095 Onsite/Offsite Deaths\n\u0095 Onsite/Offsite Injuries\n\u0095 Significant Onsite and/or Offsite Property Damage\n\u0095 Offsite Evacuations\n\u0095 Offsite Sheltering in Place\n\u0095 Offsite Environmental Damage\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n[Reference CalARP Regulation 19 CCR 2745.3(e),19 CCR 2765.1(b)(1)]\n\nThe District\u0092s Emergency Response Plan defines who the first responders are and designates the\nroles played in an event of a chlorine gas leak as outlined in t"

A facility study of possibly using hypochlorite to replace chlorine gas was recommended\nand made; it was found that the change would not be feasible.\n2. The prevention of chlorine gas releases from the chlorination system is dependent of the proper operation of the chlorinator valve that is attached to the 150-pound cylinders. Because of this the chlorinator valve receives regularly scheduled maintenance according to the manufacturer\u0092s recommendations by a factory trained and authorized repair person using factory authorized replacement parts.\n3. There are other components of the chlorination system that also need to be maintained\non a regular basis according to the manufacturer\u0092s recommendations and procedures.\nMaintenance is documented through routine maintenance checklists (see Appendix C).\n4. Maintenance of the chlorinator valve and other system components is tracked using a\nsystem that continues to provide reminders until the maintenance is completed.\n5. There is a battery backup for the chlorine detector.\n6. Maintenance of the detector is performed according to manufacturer\u0092s recommendations.\n7. The location of the emergency respirators, personal protective equipment, and chlorine\nrepair kit is in an easy access location safely away from the chlorine storage area at the\nWastewater Treatment Plant.\n8. External detectors installed around the facility provide valuable data if chlorine gas were to escape from the chlorine storage area.\n9.
