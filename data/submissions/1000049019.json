RIS is a commercial hazardous waste treatment and storage facility that processes substances covered by the accidental release prevention regulations under section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  All facilities covered by these regulations must develop and implement programs that prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and reduce the severity of those releases that may occur. These risk management programs must be described in an RMP. The RMP must include a hazard assessment, a prevention program and an emergency response program.  The RMP was originally submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by June 21, 1999.  The regulations require sources to update and resubmit RMPs at least every five years or sooner if any changes occur.  RIS has developed its risk management programs and submitted its RMP to comply with these regulations. \n\nIt is RIS' policy to provide its associates with a safe work environment and its neighbors with a safe environment in which to live.  Additionally, RIS is committed to providing its associates with safe equipment and to complying with State and Federal regulations regarding working conditions and accident prevention.  The personal health and safety of RIS associates and neighbors is of primary importance.  To this end, RIS maintains safety and health programs that employ an aggressive approach toward injury and illness prevention and a safe work environment.\n\nRIS operates within guidelines set by its Statement of Environmental, Health and Safety Policy, which is as follows:\n\n?    Our business success and our commitment to protection of human health and the environment are consistent and complimentary goals.\n\n?    We demonstrate leadership in protection of hum"

We comply with all applicable safety, health and environmental regulations, and hold the broader goals of:  eliminating preventable injuries; preventing adverse environmental and health impacts; reducing wastes and emissions; and promoting resource conservation.\n\n?    Management and all associates are collectively and individually responsible for compliance with safety, health and environmental regulations, policies and procedures.\n\n?    We communicate our safety, health and environmental achievements and challenges openly, honestly, clearly, and professionally with associates, customers, our community, and government agencies.\n\n?    This policy will guide all our decisions and actions that have potential safety, health or environmental impacts.\n\nSafety Information\n\nRIS is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"), the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\") Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards, and the Occupational Safety Health Administration (\"OSHA\").  This group of regulations requires RIS to operate under strict specifications, which protect RIS' people, the environment, and the community.  Under the RCRA regulations, RIS has applied for and been granted a RCRA Part B permit.  The purpose of the RCRA regulations (and the Part B permit) is to assure that RIS operates its processes in a manner that protects human health and environment.  The RIS facility operation was designed to prevent accidental releases as well as mitigate potential releases.  Daily inspections are conducted for the operational processes, storage areas and secondary containment areas.  Additional inspection and monitoring (also required by RCRA and the Part B permit) are also conducted to assure that the processes are operating within permitted and regulated specifications.   \n\nUnder the CAA MACT regulations, RIS has applied for and been granted a Title V permit.

The RIS facility operation conducts required Comprehensive Performance Tests of its operating systems to ensure that the system operates as designed.  Additional inspections and monitoring of the operational processes are required by RIS' Title V and assure that RIS' processes are operating within Title V permitted and regulated specifications. \n\nThe OSHA Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") regulation parallels the RMP program.  Both were created to minimize unexpected releases of toxic, reactive, or flammable liquids and gases.  To ensure safe and healthful workplaces, OSHA issued the Process Safety Management (\"PSM\") standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which outlines facility requirements associated with processes using certain chemicals.  RIS has a comprehensive PSM management program that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to minimize the potential for an unexpected chemical release.\n\nRIS firmly believes that a release of a hazardous chemical from its facility that would adversely impact the environment or cause concern to human health is very unlikely.  Waste management processes at RIS are engineered and constructed with controls to prevent or mitigate off-site releases of hazardous chemicals to the environment.  Current operating and safety procedures further reduce the possibility of such a release.  RIS' Emergency Response Program minimizes hazards to human health and the environment from fires and unplanned releases of hazardous waste constituents from facility operations.  This program includes provisions to coordinate on-site emergency response personnel if a chemical spill or fire were to occur.  It also includes provisions to coordinate response to site emergencies, if necessary, with local, State and Federal emergency management personnel.

Each RIS operations associate receives hundreds of hours of supervised, on the job training to learn operating procedures and proper techniques to operate process equipment and machinery.  All RIS associates receive more than 24 hours of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120 training within their first six months of employment.  This safety training helps RIS associates recognize and manage the hazards associated with their jobs.  It also provides organized and consistent procedures to respond to emergency situations, including chemical spills and fires.  Refresher training is provided annually to apprise each associate of facility process upgrades, potential process hazards, and safety procedure changes.  RIS trainers review emergency response responsibilities, contingency plan implementation criteria and site evacuation procedures during this annual training.  Additionally, each RIS associate receives monthly or quarterly safety training where he or she focuses on applicable OSHA safety procedures and established safety programs.  Qualified safety and health professionals provide training at RIS.\n\nRIS personnel meet annually with the local emergency service providers.  Discussions at this meeting include the location and layout of the facility, properties of hazardous wastes and the associated hazards, places where facility personnel will normally be working, entrances to and roads inside the facility, evacuation routes, the potential associated hazards of emergency response and any changes that have been made to the emergency response plan.

Evaluations are made on all aspects of these programs through inspections and associate interviews.  RIS continues to participate in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's On-Site Consultation.  Having this independent input has enabled RIS to strengthen its outstanding programs and to better incorporate associate involvement in its efforts.   RIS also complies with the OSHA PSM regulation, which requires a periodic series of health and safety program Compliance Audits by experienced RIS personnel.\n\nFacility Information\n\nRIS is a commercial hazardous waste treatment and storage facility located in rural Lorain County, Ohio.  RIS began its waste management operations in 1949.  Its primary method of waste treatment is and has always been incineration.  The entire RIS facility encompasses approximately 80 acres and is surrounded by farmland, dense woodland and a small residential area.  RIS thermally treats non-hazardous and hazardous solid and liquid wastes including spent solvents, paint solids and off specification chemicals and chemical products from manufacturing facilities.  RIS has drum and bulk storage capabilities and is permitted to store waste for treatment in tanks, in a covered, open sided container storage facility, on two bulk storage area pads, in waste storage bays and in an oxidizer storage building.\n\nRIS complies with State and Federal regulations for hazardous waste treatment and storage facilities (RCRA).  RIS operates under State and Federal RCRA Part B permits.  It also complies with OSHA standards and State and Federal air standards specific to the treatment of hazardous wastes.  RIS operates under a State issued Title V Permit.  \n\nWaste Management Processes\n\nFor the purposes of this submittal, RIS considered four processes that encompass the entirety of its facility operations.

These processes include:\n\n1) Container storage - storage in containers can occur in the Container Storage Facility (\"CSF\"), which is a covered, open sided facility, on two bulk storage area concrete pads, in waste storage bays and in an oxidizer storage building.\n\n2) Movement and handling of bulk waste (tankers and roll-off containers) and small containers on-site (including waste repackaging activities performed outdoors, and staging and set-up for processing near the incineration system)\n\n3) Waste management activities at the Process Dock, placement and storage of liquid wastes in the Tank Farm tanks, and processes in RIS' Metering Building\n\n4) Waste feeds to the Incineration System, which includes several mechanisms that individually would not exceed a Threshold Quantity (\"TQ\") although there is a potential to exceed a TQ collectively \n\nTo determine the applicability of this Accidental Release Prevention regulation to the RIS facility, RIS initially reviewed its records for a three year period to determine which of the regulated chemicals were received and managed at RIS above the listed TQ.  RIS continues a review process to determine potential applicability.  The following list provides the names of the chemicals being registered.  It is important to note that these chemicals are received from manufacturers as wastes and waste mixtures rather than as products.\n\nToxic Substances:\n\n?    Isopropyl Chloroformate\n\n?    Titanium Tetrachloride\n\n?    Phosphorous Oxychloride\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nThe regulated chemicals that are received above the TQ are then evaluated in an off-site consequence analysis that considers management of these chemicals in the processes described above.

      "SummaryText": "te for several reasons. With the exception of isopropyl chloroformate and phosphorous oxychloride, RIS does not typically receive regulated toxic chemicals in pure form.  Isopropyl chloroformate is shipped approximately once per year; the concentration is 80-100%.  The isopropyl chloroformate is shipped cold at approximately 32 degrees Fahrenheit and is shipped in an \"isotainer.\"  The isotainer has a steel frame to protect the tank from external damage.  The tank valves are located at the top of the tank and the material is discharged from these valves by pressurizing with nitrogen.  All of the lines are pressure tested prior to discharge of the material into the incinerator.  The likelihood of a leak allowing an entire tanker to release is very remote.  Phosphorous oxychloride is shipped several times per year in drums.  A worst case release would involve the contents of an entire 55 gallon drum being released.  It is unlikely that an entire 55 gallon drum of phosphorous oxychloride would be released without any mitigation.  In the event that a drum of phosphorous oxychloride developed a leak, RIS would take steps to contain the leak and process the container immediately.  \n\nRIS has also developed special waste procedures that provide additional instructions, which must be followed when managing phosphorous oxychloride, isopropyl chloroformate, and titanium tetrachloride.    The special waste procedures include information on the toxicity of the chemical as well as instructions for first aid and response in the event of a spill or release.  \n\nThe assumptions used to determine the worst case off-site release scenarios were highly conservative.  These scenarios do not take into account the preventative measures currently incorporated into RIS' standard operating procedures, or the emergency response procedures that would minimize or prevent potential off-site releases.

In addition, RIS' ERT members would immediately act to contain and clean up the waste material, and the release rate to the air would be minimal.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nRIS has not had an accidental release of a regulated chemical within the last five years at the RIS facility.  Furthermore, RIS has not had an accidental release of a regulated chemical in the history of its facility.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nRIS has plans and agreements in place with local response organizations to respond to emergencies at the RIS facility.  RIS' Contingency Plan addresses various types of potential emergency situations, including spills, fires, civil unrest, associate injuries, earthquakes and high winds.  Under its Contingency Plan, RIS will notify and work with the Lorain County Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (\"LCOEMHS\"), the local fire departments, sheriff, and hospital to control most emergency situations.  A crisis communication plan is also in place to address more serious incidents with members of the local community.  In extreme emergency situations, RIS may notify and seek assistance from the following organizations:\n\n?    Lorain County Red Cross\n\n?    Army Corps of Engineers\n\n?    CHEMTREC \n\n?
