The site is a member of the Greater Houston Local Emergency Planning Committee (GHLEPC) and has a written emergency preparedness plan that is reviewed and updated on a regular basis.  \r\n\r\nThe Solenis Houston facility maintains active involvement with the local community.  This provides opportunities for neighbors to learn about our commitment to safety.  Solenis makes an effort to support our communities through sponsorship of local activities and participation in many local organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Solenis Houston facility receives and stores chemicals used primarily for industrial water treatment and the marine industry.  The facility handles only one RMP regulated chemical, cyclohexylamine.  Cyclohexylamine is received in UN Specification containers, diluted with water in a blend tank, and repackaged and sold to customers.  The threshold quantity of cyclohexylamine is only exceeded in the flammable storage area.\r\n\r\nThe Worst Case scenario involving a release of cyclhexylamine would be the loss of four drums falling off a pallet, while being handled in the storage area prior to being transported to the production building.  The resulting release of 1,592 pounds due to the drum ruptures is assumed to form a pool of cyclohexylamine 1 c"

In the 0.297 mile impact zone using census data from MARPLOT such a release would impact a population of 381 people across 106 housing units.\r\n\r\nThe Alternative Case scenario involving the release of cyclohexylamine would involve a release from a vessel leak which results in the release of 401 pounds.  For modeling purposes it is assumed that the cyclohexylamine from the release will form a pool at 1 cm deep.  Using modeling criteria from ALOHA and calculating ERPG-2 endpoint at 8.6 ppm the impact zone was calculated at 0.048 miles.  In the 0.048 mile impact zone using census data from MARPLOT such a release would impact a population of 0 people across 0 housing units.\r\n\r\nThis facility is operated in accordance with the USEPA prevention program requirements.  A written management system is in place with operating and maintenance procedures for the covered process.\r\n \r\nSolenis maintains a 24-hour corporate emergency reporting system that can coordinate emergency response.  The facility has emergency medical treatment information readily available in the event of an emergency. \r\n\r\nSolenis Houston employees do not respond offensively to accidental releases of the regulated substances, but rely on local emergency responders when there is a need for response.  Our employees regularly undergo training in defensive emergency response activities.  \r\n\r\nOver the last 5-years the Solenis Houston site has not experienced an accidental release involving cyclohexylamine.\r\n\r\nThe Solenis Houston facility continually evaluates and implements employee safety suggestions and recommendations resulting from routine hazard reviews.  Using continuous improvement, the Solenis Houston facility looks at ways to minimize risk through process improvement and re-design.
