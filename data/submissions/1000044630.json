This commitment to safety is exercised daily.  Personnel from every department take active roles in quality assurance, accident prevention, training and community involvement.  To this end, the facility maintains a standing Safety Committee that meets regularly to address safety concerns and formulate solutions.  In addition, Oak Farms is a member of the Local Emergency Planning Committee, which brings together various industry and government representatives to plan for a community-wide response in the event of chemical releases that may impact the public. Oak Farms is also involved in an ongoing effort to comply with regulations at the local, state and federal levels that require accident prevention, planning, training, and response.  This informational brochure has been prepared to address some of these requirements.\n\n\n\nApplicable Regulations\n\nThe Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan at Oak Farms Dairy comply with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention: Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nFacility Location and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Oak Farms Dairy facility located at 1314 Fredericksburg Road in San Antonio, Texas is equipped with a refrigeration system that contains anhydrous ammonia (C.A.S. #7664-41-7). Ammonia is the sole regulated substance in regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nAccident Release Prevention\n\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Engineering controls include automated system shutdown when safe parameters are exceeded.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "e system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerent. \n\n\n\n\n\n5 Year Accident History\n\nOn Thursday, March 15, 2012, at approximately 8:30AM a level 3 trained ammonia mechanic was adding oil to C1 Vilter ammonia compressor.The employee had followed the SOP for High Stage Compressors as well as checking the pressure indicator after opening the fill valves to insure that there was no pressure on the fill line prior to starting the oil pump (OP-1).Immediately after starting the oil pump ethe employee saw the pressure rise to approximately 150 psi and the flat top of the oil barrel became convex.The employee immediately shut off the pump and the compressor.Upon investigation, it was determined that the check valve 3/4-612 failed allowing oil and some gas to escape the compressor causing the oil barrel to pressurize and the pipe nipple connected to the pump to crack at the threaded juncture due to the sudden pressure exerted on the top  of the barrel to which the inlet pipe passes through. The pipe fits very snugly in the hole on the barrel topThis escape caused a minor discharge of ammonia gas. This was not detected more than approximately 100 feet from the compressor and was due to the openness of the ammonia dock and the channeling of the air through an opening in the structure next to the maintenance shop more than the volume of the discharge.We will be replacing this fill check valve, the associated fill pump inlet piping, and as an added precaution, the check valves on the other ammonia compressors.\n\n\n\nOn 4/7/14 a lizuid solenoid valve coil grounded to the valve stem causing it to arc. the stem of the valve pitted which allowed ammonia to drip out at approcimately 1 drop per second for 20 minutes. Valve is located on the roof ablove the ammonia dock so no evacuation was required.\n\n\n\nEmergency"
