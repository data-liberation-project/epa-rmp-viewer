If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Lisbon Fire Department, or other authorities, to mimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia and loading nurse tanks for delivery \nto the farm for application. \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop nutrients.\n\nThe maximum quanity stored would be 131,325 lbs. in one 30,000 gallon tank. The maximun quanity handled would be the unloading of a transport truck vessel containing 53,000 pounds.\n\nThe worst case senerio would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank release over ten minutes. The maximum quanity would be 131,325 pounds representing 85 percent of the largest tank capacity, as limited by design standards. \n\nThe alternate release scenario based on a two minute release is a release from a break in a three inch transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint in this case would be 1.2 miles.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provissions of \"Safety Requirements for the Starage and Handeling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nThere was an accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia on April 16 2007 at this site.The release was do to theft of product from a nurse tank. We have improved our security features by installing cameras and working with local Law enfocrment with our concerns for security. The plant is locked up while not in use with all valves on the Ammonia Tank also locked "

Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance of safety conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementations at this time."
