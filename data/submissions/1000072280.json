The facility is designed to process natural gas and recover liquid products from natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means.  Both petroleum condensates and natural gas liquids are recovered from the inlet pipeline gas in this process for off-site sales.\r\n\r\nThe Loving Gas Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the plant, and notify the necessary outside agencies. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nThe Loving Gas Plant is located 15 miles west of Kermit, Texas and produces the following petroleum products and byproducts:\r\n\r\n1. Y grade natural gas liquid,\r\n2. Condensate, and\r\n3. Residue Gas\r\n\r\nThe products contain methane, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and heavier hydrocarbon components.  The regulated flammable substances include these same components.  This facility does not handle regulated toxic substances above their threshold quantities and there are no toxic release scenarios to consider.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels within the facility process were evaluated for their release scenarios.  Results of the worst-case release scenario indicate that the process is subject to Risk Management Program (RMP) Program Level 3 requirements."

The plant maintains a written emergency response plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment.  The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of Targa staff, local emergency response agencies, and the public if a release occurs.  However, facility personnel are not trained to be first responders to large fires and should a release occur from one of the vessels the facility would rely on t"

The procedures are maintained current and accurate revising them as necessary by employee suggestion, compliance audit, PHA, Good Engineering practice, Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) and implemented through Management of Change.\r\n\r\nCovered Process Operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and ensure the covered process is operating within its safe limits.\r\n\r\nE.  Training\r\n\r\nThe Loving Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating the covered process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn specific duties and tasks.  A performance review and written test or hands on observation specific to the plant operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period.  After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequently upon request.  The training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills\r\n\r\nF. Contractors\r\nThe Loving Gas Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near covered process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors:\r\n\r\n1. Perform their work in a safe ma"
