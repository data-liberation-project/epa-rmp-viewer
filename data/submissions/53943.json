Facility Policy \n\t\n\tThe owners, management and employees of Heart of Iowa Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Jasper County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\t\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers. The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia, is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. Anhydrous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\n3. The Worst-Case Release Scenario and the Alternate Release Scenario\n\t\n\tAn analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative-case accidental releases have been addressed in our Hazard Assessment and information is in our Risk Management Program.\n\n\t4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\t\t\n\t\tThe facility is in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and \tHandling \tof Anhydrous Ammonia and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia. The OSHA Standard \tis referenced in this RMP Registration Form; see Section 8.3.(b).\n5.\tFive-Year Accident History \n\t\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge have there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuation, property damage, or environmental damage.\n6.\tEmergency Action Plan\n\tThe facility has:\n\ta. A written Emergency Action Plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\tb. Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and Community right-to-\tk"
