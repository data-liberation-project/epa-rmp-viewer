We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n??A?    The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n??A?    A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP  \n         regulation\n??A?

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, we would implement our Emergency Response Plan based on the level of the emergency.  The site maintains an emergency brigade capable of handling the majority of emergencies the site may experience.  Outside aide is also available from the Little Hocking Fire Department and the Belpre Fire Department.  Traffic control, when necessary, is provided by the Washington County Sheriff??A?s Department.  In addition, Kraton has joined with other companies in an organization known as COVIEO, whose purpose is to furnish fire fighting equipment and first aid material to a distressed member compa"

Our facility includes four polymer production units, a compounding unit, steam generation, wastewater treatment, and other support services.  We store the following RMP regulated substances (chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release) in our processes in quantities greater than the thresholds listed in 40 CFR 68.\n\nChemical                           Use                         Hazard\nAmmonia                            Processing Aid                 Toxic\n1,3-Butadiene                           Raw Material                 Flammable\nEthyl Ether [Ethane,1,1??A?-oxybis-]      Processing Aid                 Flammable\nHydrogen                           Raw Material                 Flammable\nIsoprene [1,3-butadiene,2-methyl-]     Raw material                 Flammable\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that may be posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals on this site.\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\nOur worst case flammable scenario is a complete loss of a 1,3-Butadiene storage tank resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within that distance.  \n\nOur worst case toxic scenario is a loss of ammonia from a storage tank filled to the greatest amount allowed by the site (33%) in a rural terrain.  The distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are within that distance.\n\nOur alternate case flammable scenario is a pressure relief valve lifting on a vaporizer vessel at the 1,3-Butadiene barge unloading facility occurring for 1 minute.

No other reasonable flammable scenario extends farther or impacts different populations.\n\nOur alternate case toxic scenario is a pressure relief of the ammonia vessel during a fire.  The distance to the endpoint extends offsite and public receptors are located within that distance.  No other reasonable scenario resulted in an endpoint greater than the fire scenario or impacted a different population.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Facility operations and activities are regulated by rules from a number of Agencies, including US EPA, Ohio EPA, and OSHA.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs as noted in the OSHA??A?s Process Safety Management System including:\n\n??A?    Process safety information\n??A?    Process hazard analysis\n??A?    Operating procedures\n??A?    Training\n??A?    Mechanical integrity\n??A?    Management of change\n??A?

Emergency Response Program\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\n1.    A prevention effort specific to this facility is a triple redundancy polymerization safety system (\"Poly Safety System\").  The Poly Safety System is designed to prevent runaway polymerization reactions by ensuring more energy is never placed into a reactor than can be safely contained.  \n\n2.    The employees of the KRATON Plant are dedicated to continuous safety improvement. All chemicals are treated with equal respect when it comes to release prevention.  Ongoing training, procedure review, auditing, and process improvements support progress toward our goal o"

Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems have established for the way we do business. We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at the facility.  On July 21, 2009, a release of  2,000 pounds of 1,3-Butadiene occurred from a vaporizer vessel which had overpressured causing the pressure safety valve to lift for approximately one minute.  The release affected the ambient air over the Ohio River, however, no injuries or environmental damage resulted from the incident.\n\nAll significant accidental releases of chemicals are formally investigated to identify and correct the root cause of the events.  Less significant events are also investigated so that we can learn from them and prevent future incidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an Emergency Response Plan, a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, a Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan, and a Facility Response Plan to assure appropriate emergency response.  Our programs provide the facilities, planning, and training and have been developed to assure protection of workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We conduct periodic drills and critiques of events in order to continuously improve our response capability.   Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and are represented on the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThis facility is dedicated to continuous safety improvement.  Changes to improve safety and environmental performance occur regularly. The following is a par"
