We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our workers the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This documents provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n* A description of our facility and our uses of substances that are regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.\n* A summary of the results of our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n* A five-year history of accidental releases for chemicals that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n* An overview of our emergency response program.\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accident chemical releases from occurring and therefore adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nVopak Terminal Deer Park is a for-hire liquid storage terminal.  Chemicals and refined petroleum products represent the majority of the bulk liquids stored, handled and transported in this facility.  Products are received into and transported from the facility via ship, barge, pipeline, tank car, and tank truck.  At this time the facility is storing four chemicals (Propylene Oxide, Vinyl Acetate Monomer, Isoprene and 1,3 Pentadiene) that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. \n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous che"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan. \n\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases. Our accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us to effectively mange the hazards that are presented to our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that are proposed to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nProposed installation of a high temperature alarm at the discharge area of the pump for Isoprene and 1,3 Pentadiene.\n\nPr"
