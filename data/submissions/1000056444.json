      "SummaryText": "The Fayette County Water System Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Safe Chlorine Handling involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices to monitor potential chlorine hazards and reduce the risk of accidental chlorine releases. All applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are addressed in the plan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health, and response agency interaction.\n\n\n\nThe South Fayette Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine to disinfect surface water from Lake Horton and the Flint River. The plant can process up to 9,000,000 gallons per day and is at 880 Antioch Road in Fayette County, Georgia. The Water System provides drinking water to residents in Fayette County, Peachtree City, Tyrone, Woolsey, Brooks, and, wholesales water to Fayetteville. Industrial users are primarily concentrated in the Peachtree City industrial area.\n\n\n\nChlorine is stored at the Chemical Building and added to the water treatment process at two locations. First, chlorine is used to generate Chlorine Dioxide to remove Iron and Manganese from the raw water and control biological growth through the sedimentation and filtration processes. Secondly, Chlorine is used to chlorinate filtered water to provide a biologically safe product. The chlorination process includes chlorine gas stored as a liquid under pressure in chlorine containers, chlorination equipment, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and process specific safety equipment. The facility is manned twenty-four hours a day.\n\n\n\nThere has not been an incident that resulted in either on-site or off-site injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage at the facility. In the event of a release, the Chemical Building is located in the center of the property, providing the greatest distance from surrounding properties.\n\n\n\nThe Fayette County Water System's Risk Management Program includes"

      "SummaryText": " the following key elements to mitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n\n?    Operator Training\n\n?    Preventive maintenance program\n\n?    Process specific safety equipment\n\n?    Safe and effective standard operating procedures\n\n?    Hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\n?    Inspection program\n\n\n\nFurther, the Water System safety program has the following elements specifically supporting the safe handling of chlorine and the chlorination process:\n\n?    Chlorine detectors\n\n?    Chemical right to know program\n\n?    Respiratory protection (SCBA) program\n\n\n\nThe Water System coordinates emergency response activities with local response agencies to ensure that they will be prepared to respond to an emergency at the South Fayette WTP. As a department of Fayette County government, the Water System is active in the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). Members of the LEPC, including the Fayetteville Fire Department, the Peachtree City Fire Department, and the Fayette County Fire and Emergency Services, have developed the Fayette County High Risk Evacuation Plan to ensure that the community has a strategy for responding to and mitigating the threat posed by a release. In addition, in 2015, The Fayette County Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee prepared a Hazard Mitigation Plan that includes the Fayette County Water System Water Treatment Plants.\n\n"
