This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of facility's processes.  The Crosstex Processing Services policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances. However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control, and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nCrosstex Processing Services owns and operates the Mermentau Facility located in Jefferson Davis Parish, Louisiana. The Mermentau Facility is a barge loading facility capable of storing and loading natural gasoline and butanes pipelined to the site.\n\nThe Mermentau Facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Based on process knowledge, Crosstex Processing Services identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above threshold quantities at the Mermentau Facility are natural gasoline, isobutane and n-butane.  There are no listed toxic substances which exceed threshold quantity.\n\nCrosstex Processing Services has determined that natural gasoline has an National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) flammability hazard rating of 3, which exempts this mixture from threshold determination.  Based on worst-case analysis of flammables, the distance to the endpoint exceeds the distance to public receptors.  The Mermentau Facility is not subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM).  However,  we are liable for t"

Therefore, the Mermentau Facility is classified as a Program 2 process under the ARP program.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the of the accident prevention program in place at the Mermentau Facility.  Because the Mermentau Facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation as a Program 2 process, it is subject to standard prevention program elements but not to OSHA PSM.  This summary addresses each of the eligible prevention program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nSafety Information\n\nThe Mermentau Facility keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature level) in a Key Process Parameter Document.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written"

The review program also identifies the steps used or needed to detect or monitor such releases.  \n\nThe Mermentau Facility uses hazard review techniques developed by persons knowledgeable about the process and equipment, to determine whether the process is designed, fabricated and operated in accordance with applicable standards or rules.  The reviews are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  The review team findings are documented and forwarded to local management and corporate engineering for resolution.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard review results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The facility also conducts reviews whenever a major change in the process occurs.  The findings of the review are resolved before startup of the changed process.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Mermentau Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as; (1) startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also prov"

The Mermentau Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nThe Mermentau Facility uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition the Mermentau Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contract performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Mermentau Facility promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Mermentau Facility have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.  The following is a description of existing safety features applicable to prevention of accidental releases of regulated substances in the facility.\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP-covered processes at the Mermentau Facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Mermentau Facility has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes.\n\nRelease Detection\n\n1. Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms (portable units)\n\n Release Containment/Control\n\n1.
