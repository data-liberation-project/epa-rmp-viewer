Appropriate responses to release of Ammonia (anhydrous) are documented in the Risk Management Program (RMP) document. Safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs will be fully implemented by Swift Foods personnel and contractors and are coordinated with community emergency responders for emergency planning and response efforts. \n\n\n\n(b)    Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\n\n\nSwift Foods provides employment for approximately 350 workers in Council Bluffs, Iowa. This facility is a meat processing plant owned by JBS USA, LLC, which has headquarters at 1770 Promontory Cir., Greely, CO 80631.  The facility is operated by Swift Foods, which has headquarters at 651 W. Washington Blvd., Suite 302, Chicago, IL 60661.\n\n\n\nAfter reviewing the facility operations and the RMP regulations, it was determined that the entire facility is considered one process.  Swift Foods receives raw meat (i.e., pork, turkey, beef and pork bellies). The meat is processed by washing, grinding, mixing with spices, and cooking. Some of the cooked meat is smoked, sliced and packaged on site for retail sale as sandwich meat, while the balance is shipped off site for further processing.  The pork bellies are washed, smoked, sliced and packaged as bacon for retail sale. From the time the meat products are received and throughout the processes conducted, the facility maintains a cool temperature utilizing an Ammonia (anhydrous) refrigeration process. Based on the facility processes and applicable regulations, it was determined that the facility is subject to Program 3 o"

The PHA was conducted using the process safety information gathered in order to identify and understand the hazards posed by the Ammonia refrigeration process. This process safety information includes information pertaining to the hazards of Ammonia (anhydrous), information pertaining to the technology of the Ammonia refrigeration process, and information pertaining to the equipment utilized in the Ammonia refrigeration process. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Swift Foods updates and revalidates the PHA as necessary and at least every five (5) years. The PHA is conducted using the methodology specified in 40 CFR 68.67, and is performed by a team with expertise in engineering and process operations, including at least one employee who has expertise in the Ammonia refrigeration process, and at least one member knowledgeable in the specific PHA methodology used. A system has been established to promptly address the team's findings and recommendations; assure that the recommendations are resolved in a timely manner and that the resolution is documented; document what actions are to be completed; complete actions as soon as possible; develop a written schedule of when these actions are to be completed; and communicate the actions to operating, maintenance and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations or actions. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Swift Foods has developed and implemented written operating procedures to provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities at each operation where Ammonia (anhydrous) is utilized.

Swift Foods annually certifies that these operating procedures are current and accurate. Swift Foods has developed and implemented safe work practices to provide for the control of hazards during operations such as lockout/tagout; confined space entry; opening process equipment or piping; and control entrance into the Swift Foods facility by maintenance, contractor, laboratory, or other support personnel. These safe work practices apply to employees and contractor employees.\n\n\n\nTraining: Swift Foods provides training for each employee associated with the Ammonia refrigeration process. This training includes an overview of the process and operating procedures as outlined by 40 CFR 68.54. Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years and more often if necessary.
