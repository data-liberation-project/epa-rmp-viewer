Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. Stationary source and the regulated substances handled\n3. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention\n4. Five-year accident history\n5. Emergency response program\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n7. Seismic assessment\n\n\n1.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSaputo is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety through a \ncomprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, \noperating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our \nfacility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated \nsubstances.  If such a release does occur, we are coordinated with the Los Angeles County Fire \nDepartment which provides emergency response expertise.\n\n\n2.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe facility's primary activity encompasses cheese manufacturing.  The plant is located at \n5611 East Imperial Highway in South Gate, California.  There is one RMP-regulated substance, \nanhydrous ammonia, used at the plant to provide refrigeration for production and warehousing.  \nThe maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is approximately 7,400 pounds.\n\n\n3.  GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in \nplace at our facility.\n\n\n\nSafety Information\n\nSaputo maintains a detailed record of safety information"

      "SummaryText": " that describes the chemical hazards, \noperating parameters and equipment designs associated with the refrigeration process.\n\nHazard Review\n\nThe facility has conducted a hazard review to ensure that hazards associated with the processes are \nidentified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a \ncombination of the HAZOP study and the What-If/Checklist.  The study is undertaken by a team of \nqualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and shall be revalidated at \na regular interval of five years or when changes dictate.  Any findings related to the hazard review \nshall be addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Saputo maintains \nwritten standard operating procedures (SOP).  These procedures address various modes of \noperation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, \nemergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround for each system component.  \nThe information shall be regularly reviewed and readily accessible to operators involved in the \nprocesses.\n\nTraining\n\nSaputo has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that operators are competent in the \noperating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training shall be provided at least \nonce every three years and more frequently as needed.  All training shall be validated and \ndocumented for each employee.\n\nMaintenance\n\nSaputo has developed written maintenance procedures for process equipment to ensure proper \noperation.  Process equipment examined includes pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent \nsystems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance shall be performed by \nqualified personnel who have the appropriate training suited to their responsibilities.  Any \nidentified equipment deficiencies are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nCompli"

      "SummaryText": "ance Audits\n\nThese audits shall be carried out at least once every three (3) years to determine whether the \nprovisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  Any corrective actions required as a \nresult of the audits shall be undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nSaputo promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a \ncatastrophic release.  These investigations are conducted to identify the situation leading to the \nincident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a future release.  All reports are retained for a \nminimum of five (5) years.\n\n\n4.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nSaputo Cheese USA has had a good record of preventing accidental releases over the last five \nyears.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no incidents have occurred in the past five \nyears.\n\n\n5.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nSaputo developed an Emergency Action Plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous \nmaterials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and \nmedical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, \nas well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n6.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements \nof our accidental release prevention program.  Recommendations resulting from hazard review will \nbe addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n7.  SEISMIC ASSESSMENT\n\nAs part of the State's CalARP program, Saputo is required to conduct a seismic assessment to \nevaluate the structural integrity of the refrigeration system.  The findings from the study shall be \nused to improve the system in order to prevent a release of ammonia with offsite consequences in \nthe event of an earthquake.\n \n \n \nRev. 0 ? 01/06"
