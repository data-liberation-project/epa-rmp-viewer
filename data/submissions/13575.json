The ten minute release duration is based on the time it would take to identify the release and isolate it from the remaining inventory.  No other passive or active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this scenario.  Mitigation measures that would help to prevent, identify and minimize the effects of this release include:  dual pump seals, HF detection devices, motor operated valves, and remote operated water mitigation.\n\nFlAMMABLE SUBSTANCES \nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for a flammable substance release from this facility involves the release and subsequent vapor cloud explosion (VCE) of the full inventory of a butane storage tank.  The capacity of the tank is 5,180,000 pounds of butane.  This scenario results in the potential for off site impacts, based on EPA\u0012s Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures were considered in evaluating this scenario. \n\nEPA recommends that the VCE be modeled using a TNT equivalent model.  A TNT equivalent model assumes that the release is in an area where the equipment is highly congested (within a few feet of each other).  For this WCS, the release is in an open tank farm area which is not congested.  This would substantially reduce the over pressure of the blast which the TNT equivalent model does not account for.  Therefore, the distance reported for this release may be overstated.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at this facility is a VCE of a process vessel (88,000 pounds). This scenario results in the potential for off site impacts, based on EPA\u0012s Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Although a  VCE scenario is unlikely, it was the only flammable ARS which resulted in the potential for off site impacts.  The water deluge system surrou"

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS    40 CFR 68.155(d)\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the refinery.  Because the processes at the refinery are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation and OSHA PSM standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.  \n\nIt is part of Cenex Harvest States\u0012 culture to ensure systems, procedures and people work together to prevent chemical releases from occurring.  In addition to many support functions, e.g., engineering, inspection and maintenance, Cenex uses a layers of protection approach for preventing chemical and flammable releases so that an unlikely failure in one layer will not defeat the safeguards provided by another layer.  These layers are diverse and independent of each other and include the following:\n(1)  Equipment is designed and constructed using sound engineering practices.\n(2)  Control systems monitor equipment operation to keep it within normal limits.\n(3)  Alarms indicate when operations are outside normal limits and trained operator technicians make the proper response to correct the deviation.\n(4)  Instrument and mechanical protection devices prevent excessive equipment temperature or pressure automatically.\n(5)  Emergency response plans, equipment and trained personnel are in place to respond to an accidental release.\n(6)  Cenex\u0012s and the community\u0012s emergency response plans are integrated to protect the workers, community and the environment through avenues such as the community warning siren system.\n\nEmployee Participation (CENEX HARVEST STATES policy: PSM_I_2)\nCENEX HARVEST STATES encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.

In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.\n\nProcess Safety Information (CENEX HARVEST STATES policy: PSM_II_1 - 8)\nCENEX HARVEST STATES keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. \n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition).  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe refinery also maintains numerous mechanical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nCENEX HARVEST STATES primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis as well as the what if analysis techniques to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. Both analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, CENEX HARVEST STATES periodically updates and revalidates the"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures (CENEX HARVEST STATES policy: PSM_V_1)\nCENEX HARVEST STATES maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.\n\nIn addition, CENEX HARVEST STATES maintains as part of the operating procedures, documentation that provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters. This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining (CENEX HARVEST STATES policy: PSM_V_1)\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, CENEX HARVEST STATES has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors (CENEX HARVEST STATES policy: PSM_VI_1)\nCENEX HARVEST STATES uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, CENEX HARVEST STATES evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.

Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the CENEX HARVEST STATES is coordinated with the Yellowstone County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. CENEX HARVEST STATES has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments, other  industrial response teams). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as fac"

SUMMARY   (40 CFR 68)\n\nThis document outlines the Risk Management Plan in place at the CENEX HARVEST STATES Laurel, Montana Refinery.  This Risk Management Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of EPA\u0012s Risk Management Program (40 CFR part 68).\n\n2.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE PRACTICES   40 CFR 68.155(a)\n\nThe CENEX HARVEST STATES Laurel, Montana Refinery has a long standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our facility.  Our practice is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES AND REGULATED SUBS"

      "SummaryText": "TANCES   40 CFR 68.155(b)\n\nThe CENEX HARVEST STATES refinery, located at 802 Highway 212 South, Laurel, Montana, operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products from raw crude oil.  The refinery processes approximately 45,000 barrels of feed stocks per day through the operation of typical refining processes.  The CENEX HARVEST STATES refinery receives and transports petroleum products via rail, trucks, and pipelines and has a storage capacity of petroleum and refined products exceeding three million barrels through a network consisting of nearly 80 above ground tanks.\n\nThe refinery has a number of streams regulated as flammable mixtures above the threshold quantity.  In addition, the refinery uses hydrogen fluoride, which is also a regulated substance, in a quantity above the threshold quantity.  \n\n4.  HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS   40 CFR 68.155(c)\n\nTOXIC SUBSTANCES\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for a toxic substance release from this facility is a ten minute release of HF from the HF Alkylation unit.  This scenario has the potential for the maximum off site impact, based on EPA\u0012s Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures were considered in evaluating this scenario. \n\nThe potential for this quantity of HF to be present in one drum only occurs at a frequency of about 4 weeks every three years.  Under actual storage conditions, the HF which is stored as a liquid would not instantly vaporize.  Ambient conditions would determine the rate at which a vapor cloud would be generated.  However, under EPA RMP modeling requirements, all of the release is assumed to discharged into the air and no pool is formed.  Therefore, the distance reported for this release may be overstated.\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for HF at this facility is a ten minute release of  1,000 pounds from a failed HF circulation pump seal.
