It was also assumed that the dropped \ncylinder comes to rest with the crack below the liquid level in the cylinder, allowing 1,000 pounds of liquid \nchlorine to immediately drain on to the ground.  The thermodynamic properties of chlorine dictate that 12% of the \nspilled chlorine (i.e., 120 pounds) would immediately \u0013flash\u0014 to a vapor that would form a gas cloud.  To be \nconservative it was assumed that the 120 pounds of initially-flashed gas escapes through the open bay doors.  The \ngas detectors inside the chlorine building would detect the chlorine release, activate the emergency ventilation \nsystem and chlorine scrubber, and automatically close the bay doors.\n\nThe thermodynamic properties of chlorine dictate that the remaining spilled liquid that did not immediately flash \nto vapor would immediately chill to chlorine\u0012s boiling point (-29 degrees F), forming a puddle of \u0013chlorine ice\u0014.  \nThe \u0013ice puddle\u0014 would slowly evaporate and the emergency scrubber would prevent any of this chlorine gas from \nescaping the building.\n\nOf the 1,000 pounds of liquid chlorine that leaked from the broken cylinder, only 120 pounds would be emitted to \nthe outside air.  Graphs from EPA\u0012s \u0013RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants\u0014 were used to calculate the \ndownwind impacts.  EPA\u0012s graphs indicate that the chlorine gas cloud would travel only 0.1 mile before it \ndispersed to the 3 ppm Toxic Endpoint Concentration.

Re-plumb the vent from the pressure safety relief valve on the sulfur dioxide system so it vents directly into the \nemergency scrubber.\n \n? Update written operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems to include PSM-required \ninformation.\n \n? Upgrade signage and labeling on components within the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n \n? Provide remote indication of chlorine and sulfur dioxide levels (i.e., SCADA) for monitoring purposes. \n \n? Formalize employee training for loading/unloading cylinders, preventive maintenance program for scrubbers, \ncity-wide tsunami policy, and emergency response plans. \n\n\nHYPOTHETICAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe Risk Management Plan must assess the downwind impacts of hypothetical accidental releases.

Toxic Endpoint Concentrations for the RMP chemicals at the \nfacility are 3 parts per million (ppm) of chlorine and 3 ppm of sulfur dioxide.   In accordance with EPA\u0012s rule, the \nfollowing hypothetical accidental release scenarios were developed:\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario for Chlorine  \n\nLiquid chlorine (chlorine gas that is stored as a liquid under pressure at ambient temperature) is imported to the \nsite by truck and stored in one-ton containers for use in the disinfection process.  The Administrative Worst-Case \nRelease Scenario assumes that the entire contents of one of the chlorine cylinders (2000 pounds of chlorine) is \nemitted as a gas cloud in 10 minutes, during a period of exceptionally calm winds and stagnant atmospheric \nconditions (1.5 meter/second wind speed and \u0013F stability\u0014) which would result in minimal dispersion of the gas \ncloud as it blew downwind.  The thermodynamic properties of anhydrous chlorine indicate that such a large \ninstantaneous gas release is probably impossible.  If the entire 2000 lbs of liquid chlorine were somehow \ndischarged from the container, it would spill on to the ground and immediately cool itself until it formed a puddle \nof \u0013chlorine ice\u0014, which would take much longer than 10 minutes to evaporate into a gas cloud.

Since 1958 the plant \nhas been expanded several times to its current design capacity of 14.0 million gallons per day.  The VWRF \nprovides secondary treatment followed by effluent filtration, chlorination/dechlorination and discharge to the Santa \nClara River Estuary.  Effluent wildlife ponds are used for storage of chlorinated effluent prior to discharge.  A \nportion of the effluent is reused for irrigation.\n\nVWRF employs a chlorination system for final effluent disinfection using chlorine gas and a dechlorination facility \nutilizing sulfur dioxide.  The facility is equipped with chlorine and sulfur dioxide detectors and chlorine and sulfur \ndioxide scrubber systems.\n\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA\u0012S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe VWRF uses the following chemicals that are stored in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental \nRelease Prevention Program:\n\nChlorine \u0016 One-ton cylinders of liquid chlorine are imported to the facility by truck from a local supplier.  A \nmaximum of 30 one-ton chlorine cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\n\nSulfur Dioxide \u0016 One-ton cylinders of liquid sulfur dioxide are imported to the facility by truck from a local \nsupplier.  A maximum of 4 one-ton cylinders are stored onsite in a building equipped with an emergency scrubber.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASES DURING PAST 5 YEARS\n\nThe VWRF facility has not had any releases during the past 5 years that resulted in any injuries, off-site \nevacuations, or property damage.\n\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe VWRF facility is subject to OSHA\u0012s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for a"
