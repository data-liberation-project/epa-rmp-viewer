It is Placid's policy that in the conduct of its activities it will strive to protect and promote the health and safety of its employees, customers, and others who may be affected by these activities, and to limit adverse effects on the physical environment in which its activities are carried out.  As part of this policy, Placid has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  One part of these systems is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Placid and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) rule 40 CFR part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements:  Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule), and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulation (LAC 33:III.Chapter.59).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Placid.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMP Plan executive summary requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Placid.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPlacid has a long-standing commitment to the safety of the general public, of Placid employees and to the preservation of the environment.  One primary portion of this commitment is the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances in and around the refinery. Placid utilizes engineering controls, inspection programs, and detailed procedures as a means to prevent accidental releases.  In the event of a release, the refinery has well trained emergency response teams to contain, mitigate, monitor, and stop the"

      "SummaryText": "release.  In addition to handling the release, the refinery has also established a wide variety of communication systems to alert the community in the event of a significant release.  In conjunction with our local emergency planning committee (LEPC), the refinery has ability to notify the local community through cable override systems, radio broadcasts, and/or through an automated telephone notification system.\n\nThe Placid Refinery Manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the risk management program for EPA-regulated processes at facilities.  However, the specific responsibilities for certain aspects of that program have been delegated to other personnel who report either directly, or through other management personnel, to the Refinery Manager. Specific responsibility for the implementation of the process safety management (PSM), emergency response, and accident prevention programs has been delegated to the Manager of Safety. Similarly, responsibility for the RMP hazard assessment and risk management plan has been delegated to the Environmental Manager.  In keeping with Placid's policy that safe operation is part of everyone's job, many other personnel are also involved in RMP activities on an ongoing basis.\n\nDescription and Regulated Substances\n\nPlacid is a full range refinery and petroleum products facility located in Port Allen, Louisiana. Placid uses crude petroleum as their feed material and makes a variety of petroleum-based products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane. Many of these products are flammable substances that EPA has specifically listed in the RMP rule and are present in some process units above the EPA threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  In total, Placid has 6 process units that are covered by the RMP rule because of their flammable process materials.  These units are listed in the RMP data included with this summary (Section 1.17 of the RMP Data Elements"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard, and because the OSHA PSM requirements are very similar to the EPA RMP requirements for refineries, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements.  The PSM program at this facility has been extended by Placid, where necessary, to satisfy EPA's Program Level 3 accident prevention program requirements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nEmployee Participation has always been a goal at Placid.  Keeping employees informed and involved creates a team unity atmosphere.  Employees have participated on Process Hazards Analysis Teams and have access to all Hazop information and recommendations.  This information along with updated Operation Manuals are kept in the Control Room, Safety Department and Process Engineering.  Operation manuals are developed, updated and reviewed by Operations Personnel and the Training Department.  These Operation Manuals assist employees in refresher training and Operator Recertification Programs.\n\nSafety meetings are held on a regular basis for Operations, Maintenance, Laboratory, Terminal, Administration and Contract personnel.  Regulations updates and safety procedures are the main topics during these safety meetings.  All meetings are documented and kept on file.  Administration safety meetings are held on a quarterly basis.  Each department has representatives on the Employee"

Safety concerns, programs, audits, employee participation and other safety ideas are discussed during the meetings.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nPlacid keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within Placid are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, Placid has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operation manuals for each process unit. Placid ensures that the process is maintained within these limits by using process controls and monitoring instruments, operating procedures, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nPlacid also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities,"

Within this program, each existing covered process and future processes are systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage those hazards.\n\nPlacid primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques available.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as recommends accident prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of safety improvements in response to PHA findings is completed within six months if feasible.  Any item that cannot be taken care of within six months is documented and justified.  All approved safety improvements being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained by the Safety Department.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, Placid periodically updates and revalidates its process hazard analyses of affected units. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the recommendations is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nPlacid maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified by the Manager of Safety as current and accurate. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made to the process.  In addition, the Placid operating procedures provide guidance on how to respond to events that result in exceeding safe operating limits for specific process or equipment parameters. The written operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process units and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, Placid has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in Placid operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher train"

All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nPlacid uses contractors to supplement its work force during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, Placid has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform Placid personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, (4) safe work practices, and (5) a work permit process (i.e., for hot work, confined space, etc.) prior to their beginning work. In addition, Placid evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Placid personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews\n\nPlacid conducts a pre-startup safety review for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information (not required for replacement in kind).  The purpose of the review is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.

The basic aspects of this program include:  (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\nMaintenance personnel receive training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure that they can perform their job in a safe manner. Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. Placid incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nPlacid has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process technology information, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.
