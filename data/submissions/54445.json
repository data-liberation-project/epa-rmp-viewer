Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTarget recognizes that accidents involving our ammonia refrigeration systems or other facility equipment cannot be prevented by technology-oriented solutions alone.  Safety must be a constant daily concern. Like any other aspect our business, safety must be actively managed and monitored. \n\nThe \u00c2\u00bfinitial\u00c2\u00bf Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP) in development (October/November 2008) will be living documents, defining the administrative and operational processes to be utilized during and after the facility\u00c2\u00bfs turn over, June 1, 2009.  Target also reserves the right to modify and adapt its\u00c2\u00bf PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our business processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs are to minimize or eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf \tHuman error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems. \n\u00c2\u00bf \tHuman error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system components.\n\u00c2\u00bf \tLack of knowledge regarding ammonia refrigeration systems and their inherent hazards.\n\u00c2\u00bf \tInappropriate response to incidents involving ammonia refrigeration systems.\n\u00c2\u00bf \tUnanticipated mechanical"
