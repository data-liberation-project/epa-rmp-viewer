Ammonia Refrigeration System A? 38,760 Pounds\n\nExecutive Summary:\n\nTargetA?s Cedar Falls, Iowa Food Distribution Center T-3895 is a newly constructed facility.  This facility is a refrigerated warehouse for the storage and distribution of perishable and frozen food products.   Ammonia was first introduced to the system in early December of 2008.  Ryan Companies US, Inc. was responsible for construction, startup, daily maintenance, and operation of the facility up until June 1, 2009, at which point the system was turned over to Target Corporation.\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nTarget recognizes that accidents involving our ammonia refrigeration systems or other facility equipment cannot be prevented by technology-oriented solutions alone.  Safety must be a constant daily concern. Like any other aspect our business, safety must be actively managed and monitored. \n\nThe A?initialA? Process Safety Management (PSM) program and Risk Management Plan (RMP) in development (October/November 2008) will be living documents, defining the administrative and operational processes to be utilized during and after the facilityA?s turn over, June 1, 2009.  Target also reserves the right to modify and adapt itsA? PSM and RMP plans as appropriate to address changes in our business processes, as well as things deemed ineffective. The overall intent of these programs are to minimize or eliminate the following potential threats for achieving a safe work place and zero refrigerant releases:\n\nA?     Human error in operating or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems. \nA?     Human error when working around or near ammonia refrigeration system components.\nA?     Lack of knowledge regarding ammonia refrigeration systems and their inherent hazards.\nA?     Inappropriate response to incidents involving ammonia refrigeration systems.\nA?

Unsafe situations inadvertently created by multiple changes over time to ammonia refrigeration systems and other facility equipment or operations which may impact the refrigeration systems.\n\nThe PSM Program Guidelines serve as a reference manual, providing facility team members, both executives and hourlys, specific procedures for implementing the program.  In general, element guidelines describe the following:\n\nA?     Functions of individual elements.\nA?     Repeatable processes to be followed.\nA?     Utilization of employee resources.\nA?     Contingency plans for emergencies.\nA?     Measures to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.\nA?     Method to evaluate risk associated with ammonia refrigeration systems.\nA?     Maintenance and update of PSM elements.\nA?     Provisions for feedback and continuous improvement.\n\nThe program is complex and has been developed by integrating facility safety programs with maintenance management, facility operations, and human resources management.\n\nAt the Cedar Falls Food Distribution Center T-3895, Target is committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent to our comprehensive accidental release prevention program, covering design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with our regulated process.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Target has proactively partnered with Cedar FallA?s Fire Department to insure that properly trained and equipped hazmat responders are available to control and mitigate the effects of a release.   We also will coordinate such events with Black Hawk County Local Emergency Planning Committee for additional support.\n\n2.

The RMP regulated substance present at the facility is anhydrous ammonia, utilized as refrigerant in closed-loop refrigeration systems.  \n\nAmmonia is expected to be added to the system in excess of the threshold reporting quantity beginning December 1, 2008.   The amount of ammonia estimated to be in the system is 38,760 pounds.  \n\nBased on the size and characteristics of our ammonia system, as well as Process Safety Management (PSM) applicability, this facility is covered under Program 3 of the RMP regulations.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nNecessary processes to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 has been implemented and is ongoing.  The facility is also subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119, as well as the EPCRA Section 302 and 311/312 notification/reporting requirements.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the accidental release prevention program that is in place at our facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) - \n\nA newly developed Process Safety Information Guideline contains an inventory list of necessary documents that are in place.
