This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n* A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n\n* An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n\n* A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n* An overview of our emergency response program\n\n* An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe South Eddy Gas Plant located in Eddy County, New Mexico is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing LLC and is operated by Enterprise Products Operating, LLC.\n\nThe South Eddy Gas Plant is a is a cryogenic natural gas liquid recovery plant designed to utilize the cryogenic turbo expander process to recover natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.   Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  The plant processes the gas utilizing a cryogenic turbo expander to remove recoverable natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  The mixed hydrocarbon liquid stream produced at the South Eddy Gas Plant is removed from the plant by liquid pipeline for storage and fractionation elsewhere.  The residue gas is also removed by a gas pipeline "

The process at the facility is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1).  Release prevention is provided through the use of written operating procedures, employee training in written procedures, including normal operation and emergency release procedures, and in the design of safety and release prevention equipment installed at the terminal site.  In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the South Eddy Gas Plant facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\n\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\n\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is appli"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\n\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\n\n\nThe South Eddy Gas Plant has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\n\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n\n* Fire detectors on gas compression equipment\n\n* Plant video surveillance system\n\n\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n\n* Dual mechanical seals with seal failure alarms installed on hydrocarbon liquid pumps.\n\n* Atmospheric relief devices \n\n\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n\n*Wheeled mobile fire extinguishers\n\n* Personnel trained in emergency response and procedures.\n\n* Personnel protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing, hard hats, safety glasses, etc.)\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has not had an accidental release in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10, \n\n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\n\n\nSouth Eddy Gas Plant maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as "

      "SummaryText": "the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \n\n\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for South Eddy Gas Plant is coordinated with the Eddy County Emergency Management organization (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  South Eddy Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe South Eddy Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations.  The following changes are planned for implementation at the South Eddy Gas Plant.\n\n* No planned changes."
