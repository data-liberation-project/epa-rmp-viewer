The system is comprised of various refrigeration components including compressors, evaporators, vessels, pumps, heat exchangers and condensers. The ammonia refrigeration system is operated with a variety of safety devices employed within the system, included are high and low pressure and level automated shutdown systems. Alarm systems are utilized to provide early detection of problems within the system before shutdowns occur. Cloverleaf plants are monitored by a computerized system. Each system is linked to a twenty-four hours a day third-party alarm monitoring company. Ammonia sensors are strategically placed throughout the facility to monitor for releases of ammonia. Based on the readings from these sensors the system will do the following:\n\n\n\nFreezer/Cooler Rooms:\n\nA?    At readings of 40 PPM the system will trigger an alarm with the third-party alarm monitoring company who in turn will notify trained staff on the designated call list. Refer to Personnel response to a potential ammonia release below for further maintenance response.\n\nA?    At readings of 80 PPM the system will close all valve banks serving the affected room.\n\n\n\nEngine Room:\n\nA?    At readings of 150 PPM the system will trigger the exhaust fan to ventilate the room and send an alarm to the third-party alarm monitoring company who in turn will notify trained staff on the designated call list. Refer to Personnel response to a potential ammonia release below for further maintenance response.\n\nA?    At readings of 4,000 PPM the system will shut down all equipment in the engine room.\n\nA?    At readings of 10,000 PPM the system will shut down power to the entire facility.\n\n\n\nCloverleaf personnel are not trained to respond to an Emergency Situation; therefore emergency services are contacted.
