Pleasant. Chlorine is considered hazardous by EPA. The properties of chlorine that make it useful in the treatment of water make it necesssary to observe safety precautions that will prevent unnecessary exposure to chlorine thereby reducing the threat to the plant employees and also, reduce the threat to the persons in the community. Ammonia is used in the water treatment process but is not stored in quantities that require requlation. However, the same safety precaution in efect for chlorine are also applied to ammonia. Training employees when they begin to work and subsequent review of hazards associated with chlorine will be p                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "
