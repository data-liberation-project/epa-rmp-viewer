For the first application point chlorine is mixed with sodium chlorite in order to generate chlorine dioxide, which is fed into the flash mix. For the second point of application chlorine, in its gaseous form, is mixed with treated water to form a chlorine solution that is added to water entering the clearwell.\n\nChlorine is listed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a regulated toxic substance. Facilities that handle amounts of chlorine over 2,500 pounds are required by the EPA to develop a Risk Management Program (RMP) to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury from an accidental release of chlorine. The Winchester Water Treatment Plant will begin storing 8,000 pounds (four 2000 lbs cylinders) of chlorine by July 2006 and is therefore required to submit an RMP.  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe policy of the City of Winchester is that the operation of all chlorine equipment will be by trained and knowledgeable personnel only. Therefore, personnel at the filter plant are required to attend all training as specified in the RMP. The emergency response policy involves providing emergency awareness level training to employees and the cooperation of the facility with the local emergency response agencies.\n\n \n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe Winchester Water Treatment Plant has developed an accidental release prevention program based on the EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA Process Safety Management regulations that includes the following:\n\n   Operating procedures to ensure safe operation of the chlorine equipment \n\n   Annual operator training regarding the hazards of chlorine, operating procedures, and emergency procedures\n\n   Routin"

The primary responder in the City of Winchester fire department. The water treatment plant has appropriate procedures in place to notify District Six (6) Hazmat response team when there is a need to respond. \n\n\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nAt the time this RMP was being developed the water treatment plant utilizes a combination of existing operating procedures, extensive training, and extremely conscientious operators adequately reduce the risk of accidental chemical releases. The installation of a chlorine leak detector in the chlorine dioxide room has been completed in order to further reduce the risk of accidential chemical release."
