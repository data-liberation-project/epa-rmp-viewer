In order\r\nto accomplish this goal, Sewerage Commission Oroville Region has\r\ngathered safety information on chlorine and on the process,\r\nequipment, and procedures involving chlorine; performed a\r\nstructured assessment of hazards of the process and external\r\nevents which might affect the process; performed an offsite\r\nconsequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a\r\nwritten program for prevention and mitigation of accidental\r\nreleases; and established a written emergency response program\r\ncoordinated with emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\r\n\r\nA single worst case release scenario is required to be\r\nconsidered for each stationary source, resulting in the maximum\r\ndistance to an endpoint for all toxic RS's contained on the site\r\nabove the threshold quantity.\r\nThe worst case release scenario for toxic chemicals is defined in\r\nthe ARP regulations as the release of the contents of the largest\r\nsingle container of RS (in this case chlorine) over a period of\r\n10 minutes.
