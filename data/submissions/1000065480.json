Administrative and engineering controls in place to reduce the possibility of an accidental release of ammonia. The PSM program is currently under going clerical revisions. Electronic ammonia detection located in each machine room bay (total of 3 sensors). Detection system activates a central audible alarm system to alert personnel of a potential emergency. Machine room detection activates exhaust fans to vent room and exhausts away from personnel to eliminate exposure during venting. High and low level switches are installed on all pressure vessels (excluding oil pots) to alert refrigeration personnel of any deviations from normal operating conditions within a particular vessel or the system as a whole. Safety relief valves are configured to all pressure vessels, condensers, and oil separators to eliminate possible over pressurization within particular pieces of equipment and the system as a whole. Refrigeration operators make rounds every four hours and log equipment status to track system performance.Production operates 6:00 am - 12:00 am with fire watch/security on duty to cover the off shift hours and holidays. During off shift hours a refrigeration tech is on call for security to notify in case of emergency. Periodic preventive maintenance programs are in place to ensure the enitre system is maintained in optimum operational and mechanical conditions at all times.",
