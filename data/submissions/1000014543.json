The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single \u00c2\u00bfcovered process\u00c2\u00bf for regulatory purposes.  The VWR facility is considered to be covered under the Program 2 eligibility requirements (per 68.10\u00c2\u00a9) because VWR is not covered by one of the SIC codes listed under Program 3 nor OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAt the present time, chloroform in stock and anticipates that it may exceed the Threshold Quantity (TQ) for that substance under the revised New Jersey Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (NJ TCPA).  \n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 200 liter (55 gallon)  drum, is pierced by a forklift and the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Guidance For Chemical Distributors was used to determine the farthest distance from the facility"

Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.\n\nThe cross functional Safety Committee meets monthly to review progress on projects, close completed items and recommend changes"
