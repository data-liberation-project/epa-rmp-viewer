Simplot Company, Don Plant, Don Siding, Idaho, is committed to being a responsible  community partner. Emergency response planning and training of all employees is current and ongoing. Every reasonable effort is made to prevent a \u00bfsignificant accidental release\u00bf to the air from the plant. The Chubbuck Fire Department and local emergency agencies receive the annual Sara Title III reports on materials manufactured, stored, and handled at the Don Plant.  It is Simplot\u00bfs policy to fully cooperate with all inspections and requests for information from the regulatory agencies.\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances manufactured, processed, stored, or handled:\n   1) The J.R. Simplot Company, Don Plant facility manufactures fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and animal feed supplements. The Don Plant unloads, stores, and handles anhydrous ammonia in quantities exceeding the threshold limits requiring a RMP.\nc)  The general accident release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n   1) Employees are trained in the safe handling of all hazardous materials in the Plant. Each employee receives initial training, and refresher training every three years, appropriate to the job when hired or when re-assigned. Anhydrous ammonia is used and stored in several locations in the plant and employees assigned to these areas are trained to understand the hazards involved and to handle them safely.\n   2) In addition to training, the following precautions are taken:\n         A)  Pipes and equipment handling anhydrous ammonia have pressure relief             \n        valves.\n         B) Vehicular access is restricted to permit only in areas where ammonia is present."

The following elements of Process Safety Management decrease the likelihood of a release:\n   (1) Mechanical Integrity is a preventative maintenance program that assures the structural integrity of process vessels and piping.\n   (2) Hot Work Permits are required to prevent fires in areas where ammonia would be affected.\n   (3) Process Hazard Analyses are performed on all new processes and every five years on existing processes that contain ammonia.\n   (4) Management of Change reviews are performed to prevent failure due to improper engineering of modifications.\n   (5) Operating Procedures are in place and operators are trained on these procedures.\n   (6) Incident Investigations are done on any accident or near miss to find possible changes that can be made to prevent future incidents.\n   (7) Emergency Response and Planning helps to mitigate the results of releases.\n   (8) Pre-Startup Safety Reviews are done on all new or modified processes to assure proper construction.\ne) The five-year accident history\n    1) The Don Plant has had no significant accidental releases of ammonia with offsite consequences within the last five years.\nf)   The emergency response program:\n    1) The Simplot Tactical Area Response Team (STAR Team) is a Simplot emergency response team comprised of trained employees. These employees are trained to respond to fires (in their incipient stages), chemical, medical and evacuation/rescue emergencies at the Don Plant. \n    2) In-plant emergency response is governed by the OSHA PSM: Emergency Response Plan. The plan includes instructions to employees on incident command and employee evacuation, and requires regular evacuation drills.\n    3) The Hazardous Waste Management Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures for Spills and Releases of Hazardous Materials covers spills/release of hazardous materials at the Don Plant.

The Chubbuck City Volunteer Fire Department will respond to a fire emergency at the plant. The Pocatello Fire Department is the designated backup for Chubbuck. The Southeast Idaho HAZMAT Team is a division of the Pocatello Fire Department and is a support unit for the State of Idaho Bureau of Disaster Services. Power County Sheriff\u00bfs Department has a mutual-aid agreement with the Bannock County Sheriff\u00bfs Department. The Idaho State Police would respond to any incident involving the state highways near the plant, Highway 30 and I-86.\ng)   Planned changes to improve safety:\n    1)The Don Plant is continually evaluating the safety of workers and have been involved in behavioral safety, referred to as the S.A.F.E. (Safety Awareness For Everyone) process, for 4 years. In 2003, the S.A.F.E. Steering Committee received training on ergonomics and is in the process of restructuring their data collection sheet.  Although the Don Plant formally withdrew their application from OSHA VPP in September of 2003, the commitment to safety as the number one priority has not diminished.  \n     2) All Don Plant employees have been trained in basic computer skills. This allows them to be able to reference all plant safety procedures and  policies to ensure that they are understood and used on a daily basis.  All jobs at our facility have been reviewed and JSAs (Job Safety Analysis) have been written.  These documents are reviewed and recertified annually. \n    3) An independent contractor was hired to reevaluate all PSM programs and suggest improvements as necessary. The contractor also audited the plant in preparation for the final OSHA VPP inspection"

A skill assessment is given to document the understanding level of the material presented in each course by each employee."
