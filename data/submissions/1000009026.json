This facility complies with industry-standard requirements for water treatment plants that use chlorine in ton containers.  The policy at this facility is to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, the policy is to notify the City of El Dorado Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nFacility and regulated substance\nThis facility is a water treatment plant located in the City of El Dorado, Kansas.  The facility employs a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include: flocculation and sedimentation, disinfection, and final filtration processes.  The covered process includes the storage and feed of chlorine for the chlorination of water.  Chlorine is the regulated substance.\n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios\nNo Documentation in Executive Summary\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program complies with the corresponding sections of EPA's 40 CFR part 68 accident prevention program rule for program level 2 processes and applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The chlorine system was designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with state and local laws.  To achieve and maintain compliance, the City has in place procedural and technological safegaurds.  The safegaurds include an employee training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees invoved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safegaurds include controls, sensors, alarms, relief valves, and industry standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of chlorine, or at least minimize the effects of the release.\n\nFive-year accident history\nThis facility has not had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property "

The El Dorado Fire Deparment is the primary responder.  City employees handle incidental releases of chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nThe emergency action plan includes emergency situation identification, procedures for reporting emergencies, notifying the public, evacuation, system shutdown, communications directory, and a communications program flowchart.  The plan also addresses the interaction with both the police and fire department.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nThe maintenance and improvement of safety is an ongoing job at this facility.  Safety training takes place throughout the year.  Safety-related recommendations from employees, whether made during formal sessions like the hazard review or made upon observation of a potential hazard, are always considered carefully for implementation.  This process is continuous and, even at times when no major process changes are anticipated, existing safety systems and procedures are fine-tuned as a matter of course.  Currently, the recommendations made at the recent hazard review are under consideration."
