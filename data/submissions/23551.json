      "SummaryText": "Rich SeaPak Executive Summary\n   The Rich SeaPak, Brunswick Plant, is committed to ensure the safety of its associates, the public, and the environment.  Rich SeaPak's Risk Management Plan is designed to prevent or minimize the impact of an \naccidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Since the opening of the Brunswick Plant in 1972, Rich SeaPak has not had a reportable release of any of the EPA's listed chemicals.  At Rich SeaPak, everyone takes a very serious and proactive approach to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Rich SeaPak trained operators and  trained emergency response team work together to prevent and minimize accidental releases.  Written programs, such as Emergency Response, Process Safety Management, Hot Work Permits, Lockout/Tagout, Management of Change, etc. are not only in place but put into practice.  Rich SeaPak is working closely with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and other local emergency agencies to assure that if there is ever an accidental release, the emergency response teams will be immediately put into action to minimze the impact of such a release.\n\n  The listed chemicals that are used at the Brunswick plant are Anhydrous Ammonia and Chlorine Gas.  Anhydrous Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in our closed loop, 2-stage refrigeration system for our cold storage areas and process refrigeration. Chlorine is used in our potable water system and in our wastewater treatment operation. Propane is used as an alternate fuel to Natural Gas for our cooking processes. All personnel working in areas with hazardous materials are trained and highly qualified to \nperform the safe functions of their assigned jobs and the safe operation of the associated equipment.\n\n   The Risk Management Plan requires two scenarios for each covered process, a worst case and an alternative case scenario. The worst-case scenario for anhydrous ammonia would have to be in the event that a rupture or BLEVE occured in the -45 degree F reci"

Considering the location of the plant and the surrounding wooded areas, the Brunswick plant would be considered an \"urban\" site. The toxic end point estimate for a worst-case scenario is approximately 0.81 miles.  This assumes endpoint concentration is 200 parts per million. It is highly unlikely that this scenario could take place unless our facility was totally destroyed. Our facility is constructed so that it has many different pressure vessels and pipe runs scattered all throughout, and in different areas, such as on the roofs, in the process plant areas, equipment room, etc. The refrigeration system has many isolation valves that would prevent a complete loss of refrigerant.   \n\n   A more likely release scenario would be a failure in a 3/4 inch relief valve lifting at 250 psi. Anhydrous ammonia (at approximately 250 pse and 113 degrees F) is estimated to have a flow rate of approximately 92 lbs./min., determined from the EPA alternate case ammonia release table. It is estimated that the relief valve could be isolated, or the overpressure condition corrected, in approximately 10 minutes by trained personnel on site with a corresponding release of approximately 920 lbs. Under these circumstances, the distance to the toxic end point would be 0.2 miles.  With either case, the ammonia leak detection system would alert associates of a leak and a response team would be put into action to stop the release as soon as possible.                                             \n  \n  The worst-case scenario for gaseous chlorine would have to be in the event that the entire content of the two chlorine ton container was released to the atmosphere.   In this unlikely scenario, we would have to loose 4000 pounds within ten minutes, or 400 lbs./minute. Considering the location of the plant and the surrounding wooded areas, the Brunswick plant "

It is highly unlikely that this scenario could take place unless our facility was totally destroyed. \n  \n A more likely release scenario would be a severed chlorine pipeline due to a container being inadvertently released from the hoist system while transporting it.  Under these circumstances, the maximum amount of chlorine lost would be 15 pounds.  If we lost the maximum 15 pounds in fiftteen minutes, the distance to toxic end point would be 0.43 miles.
