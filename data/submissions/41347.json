Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\n  The Upper Bear Creek Water Filter Plant is strongly committed to employee, public and\n\nenvironmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release\n\nprevention program in place that integrates areas such as design, installation, management\n\npractices, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the\n\nchlorination process at our facility.  The chlorination system at our plant is one of the most\n\nsimplified and safest chlorination systems available for disinfecting water.  Appropriate controls\n\nand alarms are also in place to prevent possible releases of chlorine.  Furthermore, all applicable\n\nprocedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program Level 2 are\n\nadhered to.  \n\n\n\n     In the event an accidental release does occur, our facility is coordinated with the Marion\n\n     County Emergency Management Agency, local fire and police departments, as well as,\n\n     Harcross Chemicals in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.  These institutions provide highly trained\n\n     emergency response personnel to control and mitigate effects of the release.\n\n\n\n2.     Our Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\n     Our facility is a publicly owned water treatment plant.  Our primary activity is treating\n\n     potable water and pumping it into the distribution system for public use.  We provide water\n\n     to many residents, businesses, and industries in Bear Creek, Haleyville, and Phil\n\n     Campbell, Alabama.  We have one regulated substance, Chlorine.  Chlorine is used for\n\n     disinfecting the water.  The maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 9,000\n\n     pounds.\n\n\n\n3.

To perform the required\n\n     scenario analyses for our facility, we used reference tables for the Area Locations of\n\n     Hazardous Atmospheres [ALOHA(R)] model provided by the American Water Works\n\n     Association (AWWA).  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     The worst case scenario, as required by EPA, assumes the maximum quantity of chlorine\n\n     in the largest vessel is released as a gas over ten minutes due to an unspecified failure. \n\n     Our largest vessel is a ton (2,000 pounds) container.  Neither passive nor active mitigation\n\n     was considered.  At class F atmospheric stability, a 1.5 m/s windspeed, and a temperature\n\n     of 101 deg F, a maximum distance of 3.04 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic\n\n     endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  The potentially affected residential population was estimated\n\n     to be approximately 2258.  Eighteen public receptors and no environmental receptors were\n\n     identified in the toxic endpoint area.\n\n  \n\nThe alternative release scenario assumes the chlorine release is less severe and is \n\n     more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.  The scenario chosen involves\n\n     a tubing failure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of gas through the\n\n     5/16 diameter valve body opening.  The total quantity released is 317 pounds with a\n\n     maximum sustained release rate of 10.5 pounds per minute.  At class D atmospheric\n\n     stability, a 3.0 m/s windspeed, and a temperature of 101 deg F, a maximum distance of\n\n     0.57 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.  The potentially\n\n     affected residential population was estimated at 80.  Four public receptors and no\n\n     environmental receptors were identified in the toxic endpoint area.\n\n\n\n4.

The\n\n     following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is\n\n     in place at our facility.\n\n\n\n  Safety Information\n\n     Our facility maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards,\n\n     operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the chlorine process.\n\n\n\n  Hazard Analysis\n\n     Our facility conducts a comprehensive overview and analysis of our chlorination system\n\n     to ensure that the associated hazards are identified and controlled efficiently.  The\n\n     methodology used to carry out this analysis is a hazard review checklist specifically\n\n     designed for water treatment plants.  This checklist was designed to meet the requirements\n\n     of The Chlorine Manual published by The Chlorine Institute.  The analyses are performed\n\n     by qualified personnel and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the\n\n     hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\n     For the purposes of safely conducting activities within our chlorination process, our facility\n\n     maintains written operating procedures.
