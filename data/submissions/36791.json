The primary focus is to prevent accidental releases before they occur, while providing systems that minimize the size of any release that does occur and contain it in as small as area as possible.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:  It is Valspar's policy to operate its plants in a manner that protect its employees, the public, and the environment.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state and local laws.  The Valspar Rockford, Illinois facility has a detailed, practiced Emergency Response Plan that is utilized to respond to any accidental releases.\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION:  The Valspar Rockford, Illinois Facility manufactures architectural paint and coatings, resins, and solvent-based and water-based colorants.  The Urethane Resin Manufacturing process uses toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as a raw material.  The facility stores TDI in a 6,000-gallon storage tank.\n\nIn addition, the facility operates a warehouse for architectural and industrial aerosol coatings.  The aerosol coatings are contained in pressurized spray cans.  The spray cans utilize a flammable mixture of propane, n-butane, isobutane, and/or methyl ether as a propellant.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  The Rockford, Illinois Facility has implemented the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, which is a systematic method of preventing accidental releases and complies with EPA's accident prevention rule.  As such, the facility has completed a detailed analysis on the process to ensure the safe use and operation of the applicable equipment.   Numerous safeguards are in place and include Operational Procedures, manual and automated control systems, safety interlocks, and other accepted good engineering and ind"

The aerosol spray cans are stored in a designated area within the warehouse.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:  The Valspar Rockford, Illinois plant has never had an accident involving TDI or flammable propellants that resulted in injuries, property damage or environmental releases.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:  In the event of an emergency involving TDI or flammable propellants, plant personnel will notify the Rockford Fire Department and rely on their expertise to handle the situation.  We have provided the fire department with our Emergency Response Plan and members of the fire department have inspected the plant.  In addition, Valspar has a contract with a qualified emergency response firm to aid in the cleanup of a release.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:  Valspar has an ongoing and continuing process to update and review our manufacturing process for safety considerations."
