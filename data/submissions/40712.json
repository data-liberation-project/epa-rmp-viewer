This commitment to safety is exercised daily.  Personnel from every department take active roles in quality assurance, accident prevention, training and community involvement.  To this end, the facility maintains a standing Safety Committee that meets regularly to address safety concerns and formulate solutions.\n\nForemost Dairy is also involved in an ongoing effort to comply with regulations at the local, state and federal levels that require accident prevention, planning, training, and response.  This informational brochure has been prepared to address some of these requirements.\n\nApplicable Regulations\nThe Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Plan at Foremost Dairy comply with 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, and 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention: Risk Management Plan.\n\nFacility Location and Regulated Substances\nThe Foremost Dairy facility located at 5415 Interstate Drive, Shreveport, Louisiana is equipped with a refrigeration system that contains anhydrous ammonia (C.A.S. #7664-41-7). Ammonia is the sole regulated substance in regard to the aforementioned regulations.  The maximum quantity of ammonia in the system exceeds 10,000 pounds.\n\nAccident Release Prevention\nReleases are prevented by a combination of engineering and administrative controls.  Administrative controls involve manual isolation and shutdown procedures to be performed by trained personnel.  The system is also equipped with pressure relief valves that operate to prevent damage to system components should pressures reach unsafe levels.  Operation of pressure relief valves will result in a controlled release of refrigerant.\n\n5 Year Accident History\nThe facility has not experienced any reportable accidents in the past five (5) years.  Incidental releases may occur durin"

In all cases, improved process technology is employed where feasible.  Employees levels of awareness is enhanced by regular training programs and exercises."
