As part of this commitment, PEG has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at its facility in Cuervo, New Mexico. \n\nOne component of this system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the Cuervo LNG Facility and complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPAs) regulation 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at PEG's Cuervo LNG Facility.  This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of our risk management program.\n\nThe risk management program at the Cuervo LNG Facility consists of three elements:\n\n1.\tA hazard assessment to help understand the potential offsite consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and accidents that are more likely to occur at the facility.\n\n2.\tA prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance, in our case, Methane.\n\n3.\tAn emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of regulated substances from covered processes.\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nPEG is committed to the safety of employees and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes in the LNG facility; and programs to continuously evaluate the hazards at the Cuervo LNG processing facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, PEG controls and contains the release in a manner that will be safe for employees and will help prevent injury to the public or the environment.  Although the local fire department, the Santa Rosa Fire Department, is the designated first responder to the Cuervo LNG Facility, PEG provides response training to its employees, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities until the fire department takes over, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department.  The Santa Rosa Fire Department is staffed with certified (volunteers) firemen capable of responding 24 hours per day.  \n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, PEG has established a management system headed by the Operations Manager to oversee RMP-related activities.\n\nFacility Information and Regulated Substances\nPEG operates a gas to liquid natural gas processing facility that employs approximately 4 full-time workers.  The gas processing produces approximately 10,000 gallons per day of liquefied natural gas (LNG).  The LNG produced at the facility consists of about 98% methane and is stored in a above ground storage tank with a capacity to hold 14,800 gallons.  However, administrative and engineering controls maintain that the maximum amount of LNG in the storage tank at any point is 13,320 gallons.  The LNG from the storage tank is transported off site in tanker trucks that fill up at the LNG Truck Loading station. According to 40 CFR 68, facilities with acutely hazardous materials or flammable materials over the regulatory threshold in a single process are required to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nTh"
