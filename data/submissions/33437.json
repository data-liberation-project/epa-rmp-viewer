Rainbow Pool Service & Repair has a B-kit and two SCBAs available at the facility for the HAZMAT team's use in order to mitigate a chlorine release.  Employees will evacuate the facility to a point that is upwind of the hazard.  Evacuation drills are performed annually.  The emergency action plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRainbow Pool Service & Repair has revalidated the Process Hazard Analysis (June 2004).  All recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation have an estimated completion date of December 2004. \n\nThe Process Safety Management team will continue to provide a safe environment by ensuring employee involvement in safety development and training."
