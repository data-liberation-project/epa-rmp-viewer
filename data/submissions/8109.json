AND IN TANK FARM , IN ONE OF TWO 8,000 REFRIGERATED STORAGE TANKS (65,000 LBS.)\n2)  CHLORINE CAS NO. 7782-505\nTHIS CHEMICAL IS HANDLED AS A LIQUEFIED GAS IN 2,000 LBS. PRESSURIZED CYLINDERS. CHLORINE ABOVE ITS TRESHOLD LIMIT IS MANAGED AT THE STORAGE RACK WHERE A MAXIMUM OF 72,000 LBS. MAY BE PRESENT, AND AT THE CHLORINATOR ROOM WITH TWO CYLINDERS NORMALLY CONNECTED TO A CHLORINATOR INSIDE A CLOSED ROOM.\n\nBAXTER HAS USED THE OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS GUIDELINES PUBLISHED BY THE USEPA AS OF APRIL 15, 1999 FOR THE REQUIRED ANALYSES.  THESE GUIDELINES RECOGNIZE THE OVERPREDICTION BY THE METHODOLOGY USED OF OFFSITE CONSEQUENCES AND THE DISTANCES TO ENDPOINTS, INDICATING THAT DISTANCES ABOVE 6 MILES \"SHOULD BE VIEWED AS VERY COARSE ESTIMATES OF CONSEQUENCE DISTANCES\".\n\nTHE WORST-CASE SCENARIO FOR HYDROFLUORIC ACID, ALTHOUGH NOT REPRESENTING THE LARGEST VESSEL ON SITE, SHOULD REFLECT MOST SIGNIFICANT OFFSITE IMPACT, AND INVOLVES THE RELEASE OF THE FULL CONTENTS OF A 5,000 GALS PORTABLE TANK IN 10 MINUTES, WITH A RESULTING RADIUS OF IMPACT OF 14 MILES. FOR CHLORINE, THE RELEASE FROM A 2,000 LBS TANK USING CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC TABLE S RESULTED INTO DISTANCE TO TOXIC ENDPOINT OF 1.3 MILES.\n\nFOR ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS, THE SAME TWO SITUATIONS WERE CONSIDERED, BUT INCORPORATING ACTUAL CONTROLS AND MORE REALISTIC SITUATIONS. THE RESULTING DISTANCES TO TOXIC ENDPOINTS ARE, FOR CHLORINE, 0.1 MILES, AND FOR HYDROFLUORIC ACID, 1.7"
