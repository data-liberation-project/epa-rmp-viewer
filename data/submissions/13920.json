      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nSt. Charles Parish Department of Wastewater\n\nThe St. Charles Parish Department of Wastewater operates a wastewater treatment plant near the Mississippi River in Destrehan, LA.  Two (2) one ton chlorine cylinders are attached to the chlorine regulator system, and two (2) additional one ton chlorine cylinders are on site.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario as specifically defined by the EPA is the full release of the regulated material in ten (10) minutes on a calm night with a failure of all safety measures.  The largest tank used by St. Charles Parish Department of Wastewater at this site is a one ton cylinder.  The potential consequences and end point were determined using RMP Comp.  Under this worst case scenario, the chlorine would affect approximately 1.3 miles.\n\nAn alternate case scenario was developed for chlorine through a review of potential operation hazards.  This alternate case scenario would be the failure of a chemical feed line that injects the material into the process.  This scenario would result in the release of thirteen (13) pounds of chlorine.  Again, the potential consequences and end point were determined using RMP Comp.  Under typical weather conditions, the release would affect approximately 0.2 miles.\n\nTo minimize the risk of these events, procedures are in place to ensure the integrity of cylinders being delivered and stored on site.  The written procedure to change cylinders has been distributed to all employees.  Employees that change cylinders have been trained in the procedure.  All operators are required to hold a Class IV Louisiana Wastewater Treatment Certification.  During preparation for the certification examination, the hazards with chlorine are covered in the training manuals and discussed in the review classes.\n\nIn the event of a release with potential for off-site release, the chlorine emergency plan requires the operator to notify the Emergency Operations Center in St. Charles Parish.  The Department of Emergency Prep"
