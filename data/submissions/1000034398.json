St. Charles Parish, Louisiana (St. Rose Refinery).  The refinery was acquired by Shell on August 11, 1995 from St. Rose Refining, Inc., a subsidiary of Enjet, Inc.  Process units at the St. Rose Refinery include a crude distillation column, vacuum flasher, steam boiler, storage tanks, a wastewater treatment plant, and various support facilities.  The refinery operates under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 2911:  Petroleum Refining, and North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 32411:  Petroleum refineries. Process units at the refinery include a crude distillation column, vacuum flasher, steam boiler, storage tanks, a wastewater treatment plant, and various support facilities. The refinery converted to an asphalt production facility in December 2012.\r\nThe facility has a variety of toxic and flammable substances. However, of the materials at the refinery, one flammable substance meets the physical characteristics of a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) No. 4 flammable substance. The refinery's LSR/Naphtha Tanks TK-8552 and TK-8553 contain this flammable mixture. Each tank contains butane, isopentane, and pentane in quantities greater than 1% by weight and exceeding 10,000 lbs. A flammable worst-case and alternative-case Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA) were conducted for this material. \r\nThe St. Rose Refinery maintains detailed health, safety, and environmental (HSE) management systems to ensure the safe operation of its facility. As part of this commitment, Shell invests resources in various areas of accident prevention such as:\r\n- Safety in process design;\r\n- Safe operating policies and procedures;\r\n- A comprehensive mechanical integrity program;\r\n- Management o"

Many of the documents, including SDS are electronically available to all refinery employees and Contractors. The Process Safety Management policy also includes a summary table to assist employees in locating process safety information documents and drawings.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazards Analysis  - \r\nThe St. Rose Refinery maintains a comprehensive Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) program to identify and control hazards associated with its processes. These include processes covered under one or a combination of: (1) RMP Program 3, (2) OSHA PSM, and (3) Shell internal criteria. The refinery uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology to conduct process unit PHAs. PHA team members must include experienced employees with operating, maintenance, and engineering backgrounds who are familiar with the affected process. The PHA team is chartered to identify the safety hazards in the process, evaluate the adequacy of existing safeguards in-place, determine the risk of the event occurring, and recommend additional accident prevention mitigations when the team believes such measures are necessary to reduce event risk. All safety related PHA findings are risk ranked to ensure mitigation measures receive timely attention based on their risk priority. All PHA findings are forwarded to local Management for review and resolution.

All training is documented and managed by the Shell Norco Training Department.\r\n\r\nContractors   -\r\n\r\nThe Contractor workforce at facilities with the control of Shell/Bitumen must go through a thorough indoctrination and permit training before working in the field. The PTW and JSA process ensure adequate handoff and hazard recognition. Mitigation and safeguards are placed based on hazards. \r\n\r\nThe St. Rose Refinery routinely uses contractors to supplement its maintenance and technical workforce, particularly during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Since contractors may work on or near process equipment, Shell has procedures in place to ensure that contractors have the proper knowledge, skills, and training to perform their work in a safe manner prior to working on-site. Contractor safety programs and performance are primary factors influencing the Contractor selection process. Contractors are routinely monitored by a Contract Coordinator to ensure compliance with regulatory and Shell requirements. Contractor safety performance is also part of St. Rose Refinery weekly safety statistics communications to employees and contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) \r\n\r\nThe St. Rose Refinery conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

The basic aspects of the mechanical integrity program include (1) training for process maintenance activities, (2) ongoing inspection and testing of process equipment, (3) correction of identified equipment deficiencies as appropriate, and (4) quality assurance in construction, installation and spare parts. Maintenance personnel are trained on the safety and health hazards in their work areas, applicable maintenance procedures, emergency response plans, and applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform their job in a safe manner. Inspections and tests are performed to ensure that the process equipment functions as intended and that the equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g. acceptable wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a significant deficiency is identified during an intrusive inspection, the operating department must correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back in service. The appropriate mechanical integrity support group (i.e. Pressure Equipment Integrity, Mechanical, Electrical, or Instrumentation) review equipment use and determine any necessary actions to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices and Work Permits - \r\n\r\nThe St. Rose Refinery has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples include: (1) the control of entry and exit of support personnel in a process area, (2) equipment lockout and tagout procedure"

These safe work practices, along with training of affected personnel, form a system to ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change  \r\nThe St. Rose Refinery has a comprehensive system to manage changes to its processes. This system requires that changes to equipment hardware, chemicals, operating variables (including critical process operating conditions), procedures, operating staff and any other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, equipment information, and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, all personnel affected by a change must be provided the necessary notification and training. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation  - \r\n\r\nThe St. Rose Refinery promptly investigates incidents resulting in, or could have reasonably resulted in fire, explosion, significant toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury affecting site personnel or the community. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. Th"

Compliance audits consist of: (1)\r\nOSHA PSM/EPA RMP compliance audits conducted every three years, (2) external compliance audits by Shell's Corporate Office on a three year cycle, and (3) internal management system audits conducted annually to evaluate the accident prevention system for each unit. Employees ranging from hourly, engineering and technical, and management personnel participate as audit team members in the internal audit process. The audit team(s) develops findings that are forwarded to refinery management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented and audit findings are retained for six (6) years.\r\n\r\nSite-Specific Prevention Steps - (Good)\r\n\r\nThe St. Rose Refinery's accident prevention program manages potential hazards to ensure continued safe operation. These prevention steps help to prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failures and (2) human error. The St. Rose Refinery has various safety features to: (1) detect, (2) contain and control, and (3) mitigate the consequences of a release that include:\r\n1. Release detection\r\n- Process alarms;\r\n- Operator surveillance; and\r\n- Portable hydrocarbon monitoring equipment.\r\n2. Release containment and control\r\n- Relief systems designed to prevent equipment over pressurization (i.e. relief valves and flare);\r\n- Dikes to contain liquid releases;\r\n- Redundant equipment (i.e. back-up firew"
