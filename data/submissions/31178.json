It was estimated that approximately 10 percent of the charge would be lost (RMPP 1992) based on relief valves sized to code requirements.  However, to be conservative, it was assumed that 25 percent of the ammonia charge (4,000 pounds) would be released at a rate of 53.3 pounds per minute (relief valve capacity).  \n\nThe results for the ARS were also generated using the EPA's RMP Comp\u00ae. The release results assumed the following conditions for the ARS: \n\u00bfNeutrally buoyant gas;\n\u00bf75-minute release;\n\u00bfUrban topography;\n\u00bfD stability class; and,\n\u00bfWind speed of 3.0 meters per second.\n\nModeling parameters are shown in Sections 2 and 3 and the modeling results are as follows.\n\u00bfUsing RMP Comp, the Endpoint distance is estimated at approximately 0.1 miles or about 500 feet from a release. The affected area is represented as a circle of radius 500 feet.\n\u00bfUsing Land View V, 2000 census data, no public receptors such as schools or hospitals were identified.  The residential population within a 500-foot circle was estimated at 0.  \n\nMitigating measures will act to limit the calculated distances for the WCS and ACS, although to be conservative no credit for mitigating measures was taken. Tall buildings, piping racks and surrounding equipment will act as a barrier and tend to passively mitigate the release should it occur.  For the ACS active mitigation measures such as pumping down the system would also limit and mitigate the release.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nIto Cariani has developed a formal management system to plan, organize, implement and control the risk management program elements.

In the case of an ammonia release (concentration of 30 parts per million-ammonia) from inside the plant the following would occur:\n\u00bfAmmonia sensors from the network located throughout the plant would detect the release.  Audible and visual alarms would alert plant personnel, and the security company; \n\u00bfTrained employees will initiate pump-down procedures. Ammonia will be pumped into the high-pressure receiver outside the building. The King valve and solenoid valves located on the refrigerant liquid supply lines would shut off, isolating the high pressure receiver and keeping ammonia from flowing into the plant;\n\u00bfRefrigerant liquid supply pumps to the entire plant would shut off, stopping flow of ammonia to the plant and the compressors\n\nThe alarm panel is placed in the front lobby, with emergency shutdown switches and alarm locations clearly marked.  Trained\nemployees are aware and can initiate manual shutdown or ammonia dump procedures with push buttons located on the front panel.  A first responder (HFD) also has the ability to shut down the ammonia plant or initiate an emergency dump from the front panel.  These procedures can also be initiated from the compressor room or the control room.  In the event of a fire all personnel will follow the ERP and evacuate the area.  Fire in the facility will activate the sprinkler system and automatically initiate the emergency dump procedure for ammonia.  Properly trained employees can respond to incipient fires requiring one fire extinguisher after notifying the fire department\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPlanned changes to improve safety were developed as a result of conducting the PHA.  Several action items are in progress and scheduled for completion by their assigned due date."

The industrial park and surrounding area is used for light industrial manufacturing and commercial warehousing activities.  The Nimitz freeway (Highway 880) and the San Mateo Bridge are located approximately 1/2-mile from the facility.  The nearest body of water is the San Francisco Bay to the west.

At atmospheric temperatures and pressure, ammonia is a colorless gas with a sharp intensely irritating odor.  Depending on the concentration and duration of exposure, the health effects of ammonia gas can range from mild to severe irritation to the lining of the nose, eyes, throat and lungs.  Inhalation of high concentrations (above those in the table above) may injure the lungs with potentially fatal results.  Due to its low odor threshold, ammonia has very good \u00bfwarning properties\u00bf because it can be smelled at a level about 200 times lower than the ERPG-3 level.  The toxic end point defined by EPA is the ERPG-2 - used as a planning guideline to protect against offsite exposure - is 200 parts per million (ppm).

Bracing was designed to UBC 1988.\n2.Vapor/Gas Suppression and Containment:  The mechanical room has self-closing, tight fitting doors that open outward.  There are no openings from the mechanical room that will allow ammonia to escape to other parts of the building.  The exhaust system fans can be activated from emergency switches located inside and outside the mechanical room.  Exhaust has been provided for the mechanical room separately, therefore, should a leak occur ammonia will be restricted to the mechanical room preventing entry to the rest of the building.\n3.Over or Under Pressure Controls:  If high pressure occurs a relief valve opens and ammonia is released at a predetermined safe rate (depending on device and vessel) until t"

Relief valves will then release the overpressure (see Over or Under Pressure Controls).  \n5.Gas or Vapor Detection:  An automatic ammonia leak detection and alarm system provides continuous gas/vapor monitoring capability.  A total of seventeen ammonia detectors are installed monitoring all rooms containing refrigeration evaporators (see Figure 2 for locations).  In the event of a leak audible and visual alarms are actuated when ammonia concentration reaches 30 ppm to alert plant personnel and the security company. The purpose is to rapidly detect an ammonia release and take immediate corrective action such as shutdown, affected area/equipment isolation and repair and if necessary, evacuation.\n6.Automatic shutdown will occur in response to a rupture in a safety valve.  High pressure in a refrigeration vessel will cause the safety valve to release enough ammonia to drop the pressure below the valve setting.  The valve will then close stopping ammonia discharge.\n7.Computerized monitors and control devices will prevent releases.  The refrigeration system is controlled by an electronic control system connected via modem to a computer.  The control system can shut down any system component or the entire system should temperature and/or pressure exceed system design.  A system malfunction will also be announced and displayed on the computer system to the plant operator.\n8.Electrical failure will result in the refrigeration system shutting down.  Emergency power is available to power the exhaust ventilation system for the mechanical room and the ammonia leak detection and alarm system.\n9.Fire in the facility will result in the immediate initiation of the emergency dump procedures for the ammonia refrigerant.  This will promptly and safely reduce refrigerant system pressure.  A fire extinguishing s"

      "SummaryText": "ystem has been installed in the plant according to UBC, UFC, and NFPA requirements.  In addition, fire extinguishers are located throughout the facility.\n10.Treatment of dumped ammonia is accomplished by the emergency dump system to capture discharged ammonia and sufficiently dilute the effluent prior to discharge to the sanitary sewer.\n11.Delivery systems are designed to minimize releases.  Delivery of ammonia to the plant will be by truck to the receiver vessel only.  No internal or portable tanks will be located within the facility.  Pipes and connections are to be welded and installed in accordance with UBC, UMC and ASME standards.  Local gas shut-off valves will be at the high pressure receiver and at all equipment connections to allow for periodic maintenance, repair and isolation in the event of a problem or emergency.  Solenoid shut-off valves are placed at the main refrigerant supply line from the high pressure receiver to the mechanical room to assure effective isolation. Operators can isolate receiver vessels, pumps and compressors in case of a release.\n12.Regular preventive maintenance of refrigeration system components is performed to keep the equipment in top working order.\n13.Ammonia pipelines and high and low pressure systems are color coded and labeled to prevent mistakes such as opening the wrong valve.\n14.Inventory Control: Ammonia will only be added to the system when required.  After initial charging this may be annual but recharging is not anticipated for two to three years.  Inventory control is provided by a gage at the high-pressure receiver.  This will be the only place that ammonia can be put into the system and it will be monitored by operators and the delivery truck operator when charging and recharging operations occur.\n15.Over or under filling is possible during charging or recharging of any chemical handling system.  However, this system will be refilled no more than annually, system charging and refilling will be done under the direc"

The ammonia system inventory will be strictly managed and vendor safety procedures will be followed.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis\nIto Cariani performed its OCA using EPA\u00bfs RMP Comp\u00ae software. The models incorporate a number of assumptions and estimate toxic endpoint distances (distance at which ammonia concentration in air is 200 parts per million by volume) for each scenario - Worst-Case Release scenario (WCS) and Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) given ambient conditions and the assumed mass of the release.  \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst-case scenario is the EPA-mandated assumption that the entire 16,000 pounds of ammonia in the plant will be released to the atmosphere in just 10 minutes (a highly unlikely event). This scenario is the WCS as defined in the CalARP regulation sections 2750.3 (a)(2)(A) and \u00a9(1). For the WCS, a catastrophic rupture of the high-pressure ammonia tank located at the North East corner of the plant was considered.\nThe results for the WCS were generated using the EPA's RMPComp\u00ae software.  The release results assumed the following conditions for a WCS:\n\n\u00bfNeutrally buoyant gas;\n\u00bfTen-minute release at the rate of 1,600 pounds per minute;\n\u00bfUrban topography;\n\u00bfF stability class; and,\n\u00bfWind speed of 1.5 meters per second.\n\nModeling parameters are shown in Table 2 and results of the worst-case analysis are presented below.\n\u00bfUsing RMP Comp\u00ae with the worst-case meteorological conditions, the end point distance is estimated at approximately 1.5 miles from the facility.  The affected area is represented as a circle of radius 1.5 miles (Figure 3).\n\u00bfUsing 2000 census data from Land View V, the estimated residential population within the worst-case radius is approximately 20,000.\n\u00bfAccording to Land View V census data, twelve schools and two hospitals are located within the worst-case circle at distances between 1/4-mile to 1.5-mile from the facility.
