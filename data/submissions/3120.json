We serve Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nWe are members of the National Association of Chemical Distributors (NACD) and as members, we pledge to manage our business according to the principles of the NACD's Responsible Distribution Process.  This process provides a system that promotes continuous improvement in the health, safety and environmental performance of our company and is designed to be sensitive and responsive to community needs and public concerns.

The worst case senario for Chlorine was run and the results were 150 pounds of a gas being released at a rate of 15 pounds per minute for ten minutes.  This senario assumed a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class in an urban area.  This senario could affect an area up to three tenths (0.30) of a mile surrounding the facility.  Within that radius the public receptors are light and heavy industy, there are no schools, residences, hospitals, recreational areas or environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nThe worst case senario for Cyclohexylamine was run and the results were 2,500 pounds of a liquid being released at a rate of 4 pounds per minute for five hundred and ten minutes.  This senario assumed a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class in an urban area.  This senario could affect an area up to two tenths (0.20) of a mile surrounding the facility.  Within that radius the public receptors are light and heavy industy, there are no schools, residences, hospitals, recreational areas or environmental receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  \n\nThe worst case senario for Ethylenediamine was run and the results were 400 pounds of a liquid being released at a rate of 0.2 pounds per minute for two thousand minutes.  This senario assumed a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second with an \"F\" atmospheric stability class in an urban area.  This senario could affect an area up to one tenth (0.10) of a mile surrounding the facility.  Within that radiu"

Chlorine cylinder valves are covered with a protective steel cap to prevent damage.  All cylinders are inspected during the unloading, storage and loading process.  All cylinders on site are stored in an isolated area away from constant traffic to prevent potential damage by a forklift.  All other containers of RMP regulated materials are stored and handled in accordance with standard operating procedures.  All of our personnel are throughly trained, tested and observed to ensure compliace to these procedures, as well as, all of our other safety programs and requirements.\n\nFive-year Accident History:\nThere has been no releases from the materials regulated by the EPA's RMP 40 CFR Part 68 that has resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, significate property damage or off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe Prillaman Chemical Charlotte facility has a very comprehensive emergency response plan for on-site as well as off-site technical ass"
