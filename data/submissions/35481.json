Facility accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n     Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Waterworks (TPCW) District No.1 pledges to protect the environment and the health and safety of employees and the community in which we operate.  As a public body, we recognize the continuing challenge of fulfilling this pledge while accomplishing our goals.  Each of us shares this responsibility to ensure our long-term success.  To achieve our goals, we will:\n     A. Commit to leadership by operating and growing our business in compliance with legal requirements and TPCW District No. 1 environmental, health and safety operating standards, which may be more stringent.\n     B. Safeguard our employees' health by promoting an accident-free workplace, minimizing exposure to hazardous substances, and providing preventive health care systems.\n     C. Promote safe handling, use and disposal of our products by acquiring and communicating information and education to our employees and customers.\n     D. Minimize the environmental impact of our operations by promoting pollution prevention and environmental conservation.\n     E. Anticipate, evaluate and manage risks by maintaining crisis management programs that emphasize prevention and effective emergency preparedness, response and recovery plans.  \n     F. Commit to continuous improvement by monitoring compliance with regulations and our internal standards and by striving for performance, which compares favorably with industry leaders.\n     G. Earn the public trust by communicating openly about our policies, programs and performance and advocating sound laws and regulations.\n\n2. Facility description and regulated substances handled:\n     The Houma Water Treatment Plant provides drinking water to the City of Houma and Districts 2 (Bayou Grand Caillou) and 3 (Bayou Dularge) via Munson Pumping Station.  The facility has a treatment capacity of 8-million gals/day.  On average, the facili"

The average inventory includes nine (9) one-ton (2,000 lb.) containers, for a total of 18,000 lbs.  The maximum inventory includes ten (10) one-ton (2,000 lb.) containers, for a total of 20,000 lbs.\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps:\n     The facility complies with EPA / LDEQ accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  This facilities chlorine system was designed and constructed in accordance with standards from the Chlorine Institute.  All facility personnel are certified in safely operating the Chlorine processes performed at this facility.\n     \n4. Five-year accident history:\n     The Houma Water Treatment Plant has had two accidental releases of chlorine gas in the past five (5) years; each release was approximately 3 pounds.  No offsite impacts occurred or were reported as a result of the chlorine release.\n\n5. The emergency response program:\n     In the event of an accident or incident involving the facilities chlorine system, the first responder will notify the Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government (TPCG) Office of Emergency Preparedness and request that they respond to the emergency.  The TPCG Office of Emergency Preparedness is the primary response service and will work with Fire and Law Enforcement personnel to minimize effects of a hazardous material (HAZMAT) incident.  Depending on the severity of the incident, additional local, state, federal and private resources may be called upon to assist in HAZMAT response.  \n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety:  \n     No changes to improve safety have been reviewed at this time."
