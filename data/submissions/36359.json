Sara Lee Foods? operations include the manufacturing of pork and beef food products for public consumption packaged under the familiar brand name ?Sara Lee Foods.?  Sara Lee Foods has been in operation at this facility for over 5 years providing quality meat products and approximately 220 jobs to the local community.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nSara Lee Foods is committed to protecting the health of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore it is Sara Lee Foods? policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119), and OSHA?s Hazardous Operations and Emergency Response regulations (29 CFR 1910.120).\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nSara Lee Foods is subject to 112? because ammonia, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 10,000 pounds.  \n\nSara Lee Foods is required to maintain low temperatures in the food processing areas of the plant that are within standards required by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to ensure quality in the final products.  Sara Lee Foods uses anhydrous ammonia (a 112? regulated substance) as a refrigerant to maintain the facility within the required range of operating temperatures.  Anhydrous ammonia is an industry-standard refrigerant for meat processing plants.  Sara Lee Foods? refrigeration system consists of receivers, compressors, evaporators, condensers, piping, pumps, valves, and recircul"

This process is a Program 3 process as defined by the risk management program rule (40 CFR Part 68).\n\nWorst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Subpart B, Sara Lee Foods evaluated off-site consequences for releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Both a worst case scenario and an alternate case scenario were developed.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAmmonia\nTo prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Sara Lee Foods has implemented several precautionary measures.  Sara Lee Foods has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for the potential of anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-offs and electrical distribution system grounding).\n\nSara Lee Foods has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that result from changes in the technology, the equipment and the facility.  Sara Lee Foods encourages employee participation in development of the control measures used at the plant by means of company newsletters and training sessions.  Pursuant to written management of change procedures established by Sara Lee Foods, any changes to the operating procedures are communicated to affected employees.\n\nSara Lee Foods understands that maintaining the refrigeration system in good working order is essential to preventing accidental releases; therefore Sara Lee Foods has implemented preventative maintenanc"

These log sheets are maintained in the Engineering Department for three years.  Also, to ensure the mechanical integrity of critical system components, equipment tests are performed. Specifically, the equipment is tested to detect corrosion.  Refrigeration equipment consists of pressure vessels, headers, pumps, valves, and piping.  \n\nTo ensure that Sara Lee Foods? control measures are effective in maintaining the safe operation of the plant, regularly scheduled audits are performed on the refrigeration system:\n\n? In accordance with the PSM program, Sara Lee Foods conducts detailed PSM compliance audits at least every three years.  Each audit incorporates review of process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training programs, system mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-start up review procedures, compliance audit procedures, incident investigation procedures, employee participation programs, hot work permit procedures, and contractor safety procedures.\n\n? Sara Lee Foods is audited by the USDA on a continual basis\n\n? Sara Lee Foods? insurance carrier also conducts independent audits on a variable annual to biennial basis.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nAmmonia\nNo accidental releases of ammonia have resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage have occurred at the facility within the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nSara Lee Foods has documented emergency response procedures in a document entitled Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in order to facilitate response efforts in the event of an off-site hazardous substance release.  Included in the EAP are measures to be taken internally by Sara Lee Foods as well as measures to be tak"

These personnel are trained in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120, OSHA?s Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response regulations according to their duties and function.  These personnel receive initial training and annual update training thereafter.\n\nTo assure that the local governmental response agencies are familiar with Sara Lee Foods? emergency response procedures, Sara Lee Foods will provide copies of the EAP and future major revisions for review by the Lee County Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\nTo plan for a hazardous substance release with off-site effects, Sara Lee Foods? EAP includes procedures/equipment to mitigate the release, procedures to inform local response agencies, evacuation procedures, and procedures for public communication.\n\nIn addition to the Lee County EPC, Sara Lee Foods has arranged emergency response assistance with a local clean-up contractor:  Ferguson-Harbour, Inc.\n\nIn the event of a hazardous substance release with off-site effects, the general public will be warned using the following methods:\n\n? Facility alarm whistle or klaxon\n\n? Police and fire vehicles equipped with public address systems, and\n\n? Door-to-door notification of residents (if necessary).\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAmmonia refrigeration is a mature industry employing known technology.  Yet, the plant remains abreast of current innovations that improve safety.  To this end, the Sara Lee Corporation is an active member of International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) and the Refrigeration Engineers Training Association (RETA).  This involvement enables the facility to learn and implement the most modern safety system improvements as they emerge within the ammonia refrigeration industry.
