This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant, located in Point Comfort, Texas, operates a single process to produce petroleum products (e.g., natural gas, natural gas liquids and condensate) from natural gas.  The Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has several regulated flammables as part of the natural gas liquids, they are methane, ethane, propane  butane, and pentane.   The plant does not contain any toxic materials above the threshold quantities requiring a RMP submittal.\n \nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\nNo worst-case scenario (WCS) or alternative release scenario (ARS) exist for toxic substances at the gas plant. \n\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 3 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tank containing ethane, propane, butane and pentanes.  A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 129,061 lb.; therefore, this inventory is assumed to release and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for the WCS is 0.41 mile.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account "

The maximum distance to the radiant heat endpoint of 5 Kw/m2 is 1451 feet.  This event was selected as being a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response. \n GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the plant.  Because processes at the gas plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents (operating procedures) and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each accident prevention program element.  \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Plant personnel are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  "

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns.  For specific process areas, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operating procedures.  The plant ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe plant also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA) \n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazar"

This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are handled by local management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are planned for completion in 1999 and will be conducted every 5 years until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, and  (5) normal shutdown.  These procedures can be used as reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.

This information is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant is implementing a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees will receive basic training in gas plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator will be paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through skill demonstrations) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators will periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is scheduled to be conducted at least every year.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n \nContractors\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant uses the purchasing group at Formosa Plastics to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Formosa Plastics personnel are also used to periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant is establishing practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Inspections and tests are planned to be performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels).  If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or employees will use the management of change system to review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance.  The Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant is developing procedures and practices, applicable to the level of risk, that incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  At present quality assurance is maintained by only using original equipment specifications to order replacement parts, using the original equipment manufacturers to do specialized maintenance and or using certified shops to conduct repair work to national codes.  This helps ensure that new or repaired equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Formosa Hydrocarbon - Point Comfort gas plant has long-standing safe work practic"
