CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with CALVERT CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 3 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), and Formaldehyde.  The regulated substances at our facility are received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide and Formaldehyde are used only for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 49250 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) and Formaldehyde are present at our facility in quantities of 21,000.00 lbs., and 69,406 lbs.  respectively.\n\n\n3.    The Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo evaluate the worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as SAFER/TRACE. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenari"

The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 7.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from Outside storage in the 150# CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are \n taken into account to calculate the scenario.  With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.70 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from Outside storage in the 150# SULFUR DIOXIDE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 150 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 2.3 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.  With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 2.90 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Formaldehyde involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3721 lb. of Formaldehyde in a liquid form over 4.5 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are taken into account to calculate the scenario.

B. & S. CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     \"WHAT IF\"  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, P. B. & S. CHEMICAL COMPANY, INC. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining\nP. B. & S.
