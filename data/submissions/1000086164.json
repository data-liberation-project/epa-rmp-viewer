Facility Information: The primary activity at the facility is the production of ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer using anhydrous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received by rail car for production.\n\n\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternate Case Release Scenarios: The worst case and alternate case release scenarios are not listed in the executive summary for security reasons.\n\n\n\n4. The Accidental Release Program: The facility complies with the Rules and Regulations relating to the Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, Equipment and Storage Facilities. These regulations administered by the state Department of Agriculture are consistent with ANSI/CGA G-2.1-2014 (previously ANSI K61.1) and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111 regarding storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n\n\n5. The Five Year Accident History: There has been no accidental release of anhydrous ammonia for the covered process in the past five years that has resulted in any onsite deaths, injuries or property damage or to the best of our knowledge any offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.
