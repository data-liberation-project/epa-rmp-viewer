This process combines monomers along with other chemicals in a specified vessel to form the finished adhesive product.\n\n\n\n2.0 Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer (VAM) is the only chemical listed in the Clean Air Act 112 (r) and used above its threshold value at this site. VAM is transported to the site primarily through railcars and, occasionally, tanker trucks. Two dedicated tanks located within a secondary containment are used to store the VAM. This raw material is introduced into the process through piping, pumps, and intermediate vessels prior to being metered into the reactors where it is polymerized into the finished product.\n\n\n\n3.0 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nChemical releases are minimized through a variety of means including operator training, equipment design and installation, initial startup, operating procedures, and maintenance procedures. It is the policy of the Blue Ash facility to identify the potential for chemical releases and address their causes. In the unlikely event a release occurs the facility personnel are trained in operational parameters to minimize the effects without compromising their own safety.\n\n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Steps\n\n\n\nThis facility has taken the steps identified in 40 CFR 68 to reduce or minimize the effects of any accidental release. These processes which use VAM are also subject to the requirements of the Process Safety Management regulations found in 29 CFR 1910.119. The following paragraphs briefly describe the current release prevention program for the process which polymerizes VAM.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThis information describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment design for the associated processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\n\n\nThis is a systematic review of the process "

      "SummaryText": "by a cross functional team used to ensure the hazards of the process are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used in these analyses is the HAZOP technique. The identified recommendations are reviewed, prioritized and implemented in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nOperating procedures are used to safely produce products in an effective and repeatable manner. These procedures address the various stages of the operation including initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency operations, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, process sequencing, and startup after a shutdown. The procedures are periodically reviewed and are readily accessible to the operators.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nMaintenance of the equipment requires a variety of methodology. Testing and studies are performed equipment such as vessels and piping to determine that it continues to meet its design capabilities; inspections are performed on devices such as rupture disks and vents to ensure they are operational; periodic maintenance is used on that equipment (pumps, controls, valves, etc.) which is used regularly. Qualified personnel are used to perform these maintenance operations. Should a deficiency be identified during any one of these processes, it is addressed in a timely and safe manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\n\n\nChanges in the process are proposed, described, and reviewed with through written procedures. Changes can be a change in chemical, technology, equipment or procedure. Those affected by the change are notified and trained, if necessary.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Review\n\n\n\nPrior to a new process startup the installation, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are reviewed to ensure they are suitable for safe operations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audit\n\n\n\nAudits are used to identify any shortcomings in the existing program in comparison to the regulations and allow for continuous improvement. These occur at least every three years. Any corrective actio"

The purpose of the investigation is to record the steps leading up to the incident, identify any abnormal or unusual conditions and develop effective corrective actions to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The reports are maintained for at least five years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nActive participation of operators, maintenance mechanics, facility management and corporate personnel is both required and encouraged. Additional forums such as employee involvement teams, safety meetings and business meetings are used in inform and interact with individuals.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nSome projects or tasks require additional manpower or specialized skills more efficiently provided by contractors. These contractors are made aware of the potential hazards related to the contract work and operation.\n\n\n\n5.0 Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents or releases as define in 40 CFR 68.42 over the preceding 5-year period.\n\n\n\n6.0 Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe Pre-Emergency Plan was written to address abnormal situations such as employee injury and chemical release. The text includes procedures to address emergency response, evacuation of employees, notification of governmental agencies, and medical responses. It is reviewed annually and updated to reflect any pertinent changes which occasionally occur at the facility. A secondary part of the program is the installation and operation of equipment which will stop an emergency event, minimize its effects or allow evacuation from a process area. The equipment includes a monitored sprinkler system, fire detecting devices and fire extinguishers. These systems are regularly inspected and serviced in order to maintain their reliability.\n\n\n\n7.0 Planned Safety Improvements\n\n\n\nSafety improvements are identified through a continuous process that utilizes preventative mai"
