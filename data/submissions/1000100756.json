The valves were ultimately replaced with an upgraded model, and two sets of two valves were installed.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Summary\r\n\r\nApex Generating Station has established a written emergency response plan that is followed by the employees to help safely control accidental releases of hazardous substances.  This program has been coordinated with the Clark County Fire Department, the City of Las Vegas Fire Department, and Office of Emergency Management, members of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).  This program includes emergency evacuation routes, required emergency notifications, and staff responsibilities in the event of an emergency.  Emergency procedures are also reviewed once per year. \r\n\r\nPlan To Abate Hazards\r\n\r\nDuring the process hazard analyses, additional risk reduction measures were recommended to improve safety, minimize the likelihood and mitigate the effects of an ammonia release at the Apex Generating Station.  A table was used as a  plan to abate hazards identified in the process hazard analysis.

This system allows our employees to identify and review safety hazards or provide additional safety, process, or chemical information before the proposed change is implemented.\r\n\r\nInternal Compliance Audits\r\n\r\nInternal compliance audits are conducted every 3 years to verify compliance with the programs and procedures contained in the RMP.  Apex Generating Station assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the regulatory process.  This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program are implemented.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nApex Generating Station investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment, so that similar accidents can be prevented.  Apex Generating Station trains employees to identify and report any incident that requires investigation.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of any incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.  Information found during the investigation is reviewed by appropriate staff and is added to, or used to revise operating and maintenance procedures.  Information from audits and any resulting changes in operating procedures are passed onto the training unit for their inclusion in existin"

The site is located in Clark County about 20 miles northeast of Las Vegas.  Southern California Public Power Authority owns the 90-acre site which is within Section 5, Township 18 South, Range 63 East.  The site has two immediate neighbors: a power plant to the south and a transportation engineering test facility to the north.  The remaining neighbors to the south and east are part of the Apex Industrial Park, which is currently under development.  The RMP has a complete list of all current and future industrial facilities that are located within the worst-case release radius.  Federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management are present to the west of the property boundary.  Further west of the federal lands is the Desert National Wildlife Range. The facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CAPP regulations, in a steel bulk storage tank.  \r\n\r\nAmmonia is used at the Apex Generating Station to reduce nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two Combustion Turbine Generators (CTG) and two HRSG duct burners.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the two SCR units to reduce the NOx emissions.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in a 15,228-gallon capacity storage tank.  Because the storage tank is restricted from being filled to more than 80 percent, the maximum inventory of the anhydrous ammonia at the Apex Generating Station is 12,182 gallons or approximately 58,000 pounds.

      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  The Apex Generating Station also uses chemicals as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere.  Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  As the company responsible for operating Apex Generating Station, owned by Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA), EthosEnergy Group (Ethos) takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\r\n\r\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendments of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the Chemical Accident Prevention Program (CAPP) Program under Nevada Administrative Code 459.952.  This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment.  Apex Generating Station has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nSCPPA is a Joint Powers Authority, created in 1980, for the purpose of providing joint planning, financing, construction, and operation of transmission and generation projects.
