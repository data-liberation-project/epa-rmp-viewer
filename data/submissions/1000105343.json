Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\nKroger Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property. The safety and health of all personnel are very important. The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel at the GLRDC.\n\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program. The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68). Mr. Gary Streepy, Regulatory Compliance, is responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses environmental impacts and physical property damage.\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are detailed and improved as necessary. The"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\nThe Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center is part of Kroger Dedicated Logistics Inc. The facility is a distribution center that distributes dry grocery, perishable, and frozen food products for assembly and distribution to Kroger retail food stores. The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities. The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds. The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 37,000 pounds. Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\nThe prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\nEmployee Participation: This program involves the employees in establishing and implementing the program. Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted. The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.

The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. They are also performed when there is a change in the process safety information. \n\n\nMechanical Integrity: This program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are built and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.\n\n\nHot Work Permit: These procedures ensure that a signed permit is obtained prior to any cutting, welding, or burning.\n\n\nManagement of Change: Procedures are designed to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed.\n\n\nIncident Investigation: Procedures ensure that any incidents (and near misses) are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team. Any recommendations are resolved to improve the safety of the facility.\n\n\nCompliance Audits: There are procedures to conduct regular audits of the RM prevention program to ensure that the program is in place and working properly.

Description of the Emergency Response Program\n\n\nAn emergency response program has been implemented at the Great Lakes Regional Distribution Center facility. This program contains procedures describing how the facility will respond to ammonia spills and other emergencies, including evacuation procedures. The program has been coordinated with the Delaware City Fire Department. The facility has cooperated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee to develop a response plan that can be used in the event of an\nammonia release that may have off site impact.\n\n\nThe emergency response program consists of the following elements:\n\n\nOrganization Plan and Responsibilities\nCommunications Procedures\nDetailed Action Plans\nFirst Aid Procedures\nEmergency Medical Treatment Procedures\nEvacuation Plans\nDescription of Outside Assistance Available\nSite Re-Entry Procedures\nTraining Programs and Drills\n\n\nF.

We will include Delaware CEMA this year to establish a solid Response Team."
