      "SummaryText": "Battle Ridge Gas Plant, owned and operated by Enlink Midstream Operating, LP , is committed to the same brand of safety and environmental excellence that all other company assets promote. This philosophy involves making each and every employee and contractor accountable for their own safety, as well as that of the community around them. As a company, we follow a close adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all.\r\n\r\nEmployees who enter the Battle Ridge Gas Plant facility complete a thorough training, both in the classroom and on-the-job, that enables them to address emergency issues as they arise. This preparation includes standard operational, emergency operational, and release prevention training. In addition, periodic refresher courses help to keep operators' problem solving abilities up-to-date and in sync with our recurring safety improvements. Our regular internal audits provide an excellent check-and-balances system for monitoring these high standards that we set.\r\n\r\nThe Battle Ridge Gas Plant is located on County Road E0740 near Cushing, Oklahoma.  Battle Ridge Gas Plant is a non-fractionating NGL extraction plant designed to process a maximum of 75 MMSCFD of natural gas. The plant consists of inlet gas compression, separation and filtration,  5,000 BPD stabilizer, 75 GPM amine treatment unit, 75MMSCFD cryogenic processing unit, refrigeration unit, 60 MMSCFD nitrogen rejection unit (NRU), residue compression, and NRU compression, including all associated utilities and ancillary systems.  Condensate recovered from inlet gas is stored in six 400-barrel tanks in a concrete-diked containment area and loaded into tanker trucks for shipment.  NGL from the cryogenic unit and natural gas from residue compression are sent offsite via pipeline without intermediate storage.  The facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility under the regulation. The worst case scenario (described in the RMP submittal"

An alternative release is the loss of NGL due to a hose break during loading. There are numerous safety devices to prevent such events from occurring at the facility. We have discussed these potential hydrocarbon releases with our employees and with local emergency response officials in Payne County, thereby further reducing the possibility of any impact on the public. The following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Battle Ridge Gas Processing Plant (Battle Ridge). Because the processes at the plant regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Risk Management Program (RMP) are also subject to the OSHA PSM, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation: Active employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the company's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Employee involvement will help to ensure that all perspectives regarding PSM are considered, and that the best ideas are implemented. Open communications are encouraged between supervisors and employees regarding all safety and health issues. Enlink strongly promotes employee involvement in safety issues through existing programs. These programs include regularly scheduled safety meetings, tail gate safety meetings, Hazard Communications, and other training programs (emergency response training, first aid, etc.). \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information: Complete and accurate written process safety information (PSI) concerning process chemicals, process technology, and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program and to completing and maintaining a process hazard"

The PSI will be useful to the operators, the team performing the PHA, those in charge or training, contractors, those conducting pre-startup safety reviews, and those in charge of updating the emergency response plan. Process safety information is readily available to all employees. Enlink keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS's). \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA): Enlink  has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes of Battle Ridge are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. Periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures: Enlink maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations for Battle Ridge, such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, normal shutdown, and initial startup of a new process. These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also p"

The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff. \r\n\r\nTraining: In addition to training on operating procedures, the facility has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process. New employees receive basic training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training is documented for each operator including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \r\n\r\nContractors: The Chisholm Processing Plant uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities. Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the station has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work. In addition, Enlink Midstream Partners has a program in place to evaluate contractor safety programs and performance. Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\r\n\r\nPre Startup Safety Review (PSSR): Enlink conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.

This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity: The Battle Ridge facility has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment. The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies when identified, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical  integrity of the process. \r\n\r\nSafe Work Practices: Enlink has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety. Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exist of support personnel, (2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment are opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark producing activities (i.e., hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change: Battle Ridge has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all covered processes.

The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the re-occurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a re-occurrence, and forward these results to the business management team for resolution. \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits: To help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Battle Ridge periodically conducts an audit to determine whether procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years. Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Battle Ridge management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \r\n\r\nFive year Accident History: No incident resulting in onsite or offsite impacts from a hydrocarbon release has occurred at Battle Ridge within the last 5 years; note, the facility started operations during the month of the initial RMP submittal. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program: In the event of an emergency involving our natural gas liquid extrac"
