Hempy\r\n\r\nFacility Telephone: (740)465-3251\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Protocols:  The owners, management and employees of the Morral facility are committed to providing a state workplace free of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Health, safety and environmental compliance are a fundamental part of every employee's job.  It is facility protocol to adhere to applicable Federal, State and local laws and to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release were to occur, the facility would respond in accordance with its Emergency Action Plan and is prepared to work with the local fire department, the Local Emergency Planning Committee and other authorities to control and mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to employees, the environment and the general public.\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  The primary activity at this facility (the stationary source) is the storage, handling and mixing of fertilizers for direct retail sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, mixed and distributed for direct application as crop production nutrients.  The maximum stored quantity of anhydrous ammonia at the facility is approximately 140,000 pounds stored in one (1) 30,000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum fill level of the tank is 85% of the total tank capacity.  This facility is loaded by transport truck, therefore the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled would occur when the on-site storage tank is at the maximum fill level of 85%.\r\n\r\n10-34-0 Liquid fertilizer is manufactured by combining anhyrdous ammonia, super phosphoric acid and water in a converter reactor.  The super phosphoric acid is delivered in insulated rail tank cars.  The super phosphoric acid is transferred to the reactor via a flexible hose to the reactor tank.  The anhydrous ammo"

After the heat exchanger, the anhydrous ammonia vapor is mixed with the water and phosphoric acid, which is pumped from the phosphoric acid rail car to the reactor.  THe anhydrous ammonia and phosphoric acid react to form ammonium phosphates and heat.  The ammonium phosphates exit the reactor and enter a holding pool where they mix with water to form an ammonium phosphate solution (i.e. 10-34-0).\r\n\r\nThe ammonium phosphate solution is pumped to a heat exchanger that is cooled with a cooling tower.  Th ecooled solution then returns to th eholding pool.\r\n\r\nSome of the ammonium phosphate solution in the holding pool is pumped out to the anhydrous ammonia heat exchanger.  The warm ammonium phosphate solution is used to vaporize the anhydrous ammonia liquid from the anhydrous ammonia tank.  The ammonium phosphate solution, which is cooled by the anhydrous ammonia vaporization flows to a storage tank.\r\n\r\nNPk (nitrogen - phosphorus - potassium) grade fertilizers are manufactured by combining anhydrous ammonia, water and other raw materials to achieve the proper ratios.  During this process the ammonia is added to the water to create an aqueous ammonia solution.  This is the source of nitrogen for the fertilizer.  The other sources of phosphorus and potassium are added to this solution in the amounts desired to achieve the proper NPK ratio (i.e., 5-10-10, 16-4-4, 7-22-5).\r\n\r\nSlow release fertilizers are manufactured by combining water, anhydrous ammonia, and other raw materials.  This process is done at an elevated temperature to form a certain molecular structure.  Ammonia is used in this process as a source of nitrogen for the fertilizer.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Sp"

The following sections 1 through 7 briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program for the primary activity at this facility, which is the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  Sections 8 through 19 briefly describe the release prevention program elements for the liquid fertilizer manufacturing process.\r\n\r\n1) Safety information:  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with applicable Federal and State regulations.  All plans and procedures maintained at the facility are periodically reviewed by facility management for safety updates and changes.  Material Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications and the codes and standards used to build and operate the anhydrous ammonia equipment are maintained at the facility.\r\n\r\n2) Hazard Review:  Facility management conducts reviews of the hazards associated with the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The reviews identify the opportunity for equipment malfunctions or human errors that could cause an accidental release, the safeguards used to control hazards and prevent releases, and the steps used to detect or monitor releases.  The results of the reviews are documented and problems identified are addressed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n3) Operating Procedures:  The facility maintains written operating procedures for the handling and storage of anhydrous ammonia.  The procedures generally follow the provisions of the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard, 29 CFR 1910, 111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" and the American National Standards Institute (ANS) standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\".

The training program is reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\r\n\r\n5) Maintenance:  The facility maintains written equipment inspection and maintenance procedures.  Storage and transfer/process equipment inspections are performed by qualified personnel on an approximate annual basis and are documented.  Equipment maintenance procedures follow either instructions furnished by the equipment vendors, Federal or State regulations (i.e., the provisions of the OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\") or industry codes (i.e., the provisions of the ANSI standard, \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\")  The written procedures are reviewed by facility management on a regular basis and revised as necessary.\r\n\r\n6) Compliance Audits:  As required by the RMP rule, compliance audits will be performed at least once every three (3) years.
