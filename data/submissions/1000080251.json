The comprehensive accidental release prevention program covers areas such as safety, hazard analysis, operating procedures, maintenance and employee training  associated with the processes at the facility.  The effective emergency response plan covers response procedures such as pre-emergency employee training, lines of authority, emergency recognition, evacuation routes and procedures and emergency medical treatment.  It is the Laurens County Water & Sewer Commission's policy to implement appropriate measures to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\nThe Clinton/Joanna Wastewater Treatment Plant has one (1) regulated substance at the facility above the threshold quantity.  The regulated substance is chlorine.  Chlorine is used in the wastewater treatment process.  Chlorine is handled in one ton cylinders and the maximum amount of chlorine handled is 4,000 pounds.  The Laurens County Water & Sewer Commission is mandated to meet Program 3 requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION \r\nThe Clinton/Joanna Wastewater Treatment Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
