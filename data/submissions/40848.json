      "SummaryText": "Faulkner Ag center, Inc\n410 Faulkner Lane\nAckley, IA  50601\n\nRisk Management Plan - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.  The Facility Policy\n\n     The owners, management and emplyees of Faulkner Ag Center Inc. are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company, or other authorities to minigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage and sale of anhydrous ammonia to farmers and the use of propane to dry corn.\n\n     Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application to the farmer's field.\n\n     The maximum quanity of anhydrous stored and handled would be 51,000 pounds in our 12,000 gallon storage tank.\n\n     The maximum amount of propane stored and handled would be 22,000 pounds.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n     a.     The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas ove 10 minutes.  The maximum wuantity released would be 60,000 pounds which represents the volume of the storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\n     b.     The alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.4 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standars Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)"

      "SummaryText": ", 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History \n\n     There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility: nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency repsonse program.\n\n     The facility has:\n\n     a.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n     b.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n     c.  a written emergency response program, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency planning and employee training.\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n     Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
