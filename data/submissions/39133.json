FACILITY INFORMATION\n\nSymrise, Inc. at Bushy Park, SC,  produces aroma chemicals and cosmetic ingredients.  The Symrise corporate headquarters is located In Holtzminden, Germany. ( Symrise GmbH & Co., KG, M\u00fchlenfeldstrasse 1,D-37603, Holzminden, Germany)  The Symrise, Bushy Park Site manufactures various forms of menthol, sunscreens, cooling agents, and fragrance specialties.  Symrise, Bushy Park was formerly a subsidiary of Bayer Corporation who established the Bushy Park site in 1970.  Haarmann & Reimer (now Symrise)  was acquired by EQT Partners on October 1, 2002.  Prior to this date, H&R was included in the RMP considerations of Bayer Corporation who filed their RMP by the statutory deadline.\n\nSymrise is located within Bayer's 1650 acre site which is operated as an Industrial Park wherein Bayer owns the land and the various tenants own and operate the assets on the land.  The site is on the Cooper River just a few miles east of Goose Creek, S C. Symrise has contracted with Bayer Corporation to purchase various materials and services.\n\nII. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSymrise is committed to health, the environment and safety.  Symrise considers its responsibility to protect the environment and the health and safety of its employees, customers and the area communities of primary importance in the conduct of its business.

Symrise is committed to continually improving health, environment and safety performance.\n\nOur industry creates products and services that make life better for many people around the world - both today and tomorrow.  We will make continuous progress toward the goal of no accidents, injuries or harm to the environment.  We will adhere to the following principals:\n\n+ To provide chemicals that can be manufactured, transported, used and disposed of safely.\n+ To make health, safety, the environment and resource conservation critical considerations for all new and existing products and processes.\n+ To provide information on health or environmental risks and pursue protective measures for employees, the public and other key stakeholders.\n+ To work with customers, carriers, suppliers, distributors and contractors to foster the safe use, transport and disposal of chemicals.\n+ To operate our facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public.\n+ To support education and research on the health, safety and environmental effects of our products and processes.\n+ To work with others to resolve problems created by past handling and disposal practices.\n\nLocal Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)\n\nSymrise has worked with the county and local agencies and response groups to provide information about the chemicals we use on our site.  In addition, the site emergency plans have been integrated with the emergency plans of the county and local fire departments.  Symrise has participated in disaster drills held by the LEPC.\n\nCompliance and Commitment to Safety\n\nProtection of our employees and neighbors is our highest priority, and t"

      "SummaryText": "hat is why we have installed multiple safeguards to ensure that all chemicals are handled safely.  We also work closely with our suppliers, other companies, local officials and the public to maintain stringent safety and environmental programs and to minimize risks.  \n\nIn keeping with our commitment, Symrise has developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in compliance with guidelines established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Under EPA guidelines, facilities that handle certain quantities of regulated chemicals must submit plans that show the consequences of hypothetical chemical releases.  Facilities must also outline their measures to reduce the risk of releases and minimize their effects.\n\nSeveral processes at the site are regulated by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements listed in 29 CFR Part 1910.119.  PSM and RMP complement each other in that PSM is concerned about the employee and RMP is concerned about the public and the environment.  The Bushy Park site is in full compliance with the PSM requirements.  \n\nIII. RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nFinal construction and start up has been completed on the new process subsequent to our initial RMP submission in November 2002. The new process is in compliance with PSM requirements for the Risk Management Program listed in 40 CFR Part 68.  The new process includes an ammonia refrigeration system and a pentane storage and handling system.  Ammonia is present as liquefied gas under pressure.  It is regulated as a toxic substance.  Pentane is a liquid stored at ambient temperature and is regulated as a flammable material. \n\nSymrise will use anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in the new process area. Prior to the initial submission, Symrise (formerly H&R) was included in the Bayer RMP for ammonia.  It is delivered via an overhead pipeline system from Bayer Corporation's plant-wide distribution system.  Ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor.  Exposure to ammonia can irritate the"

Exposure to extremely high levels can result in a buildup of fluid in the lungs and can be life threatening.\n\nSymrise uses pentane in the new process area as a solvent in the manufacturing of a fragrance product.  Pentane is a highly flammable liquid that can reach explosive concentrations in the atmosphere if released without restriction.\n\nIV. FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nDuring the past five years Symrise has not experienced any release of ammonia or pentane that requires listing in the RMP information we are submitting.  \n\nV. EMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nIncident and Emergency Guidelines\n\nSymrise has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safe handling of ammonia and pentane and to prevent releases of these substances.  Our facility is prepared to handle emergencies such as hurricanes and tornadoes as well as chemical releases.  In the unlikely event a release occurs, we work to contain the release quickly and to minimize its impact on plant personnel and neighbors.  If a release occurs equipment that supplies the regulated substance would be shut down quickly by remote control.\n\nSymrise is a partner in the Bayer Industrial Park.  Bayer manages the Industrial Park Emergency Operations Center (EOC) that Symrise participates in.  If a release occurs, the EOC is activated and the follow actions are implemented:\n+ The plant alarm would be sounded and the emergency communicated to plant personnel over the emergency alert system.\n+ Trained on-site emergency response teams would be activated and take prompt action to control and stop the release. \n+ Emergency response personnel would evaluate the extent and impact of the release\n+ If the release would have potential off-site impact, or outside assistance needed, local and county emergency response personnel would be notified and activated.\n+ Neighbors in the immediate area that might be affected would be notified and advised to take appropriate action.\n+ If necessary, Site specialists would be activated to"
