This includes the West Water Treatment Plant located at 300 South 49th Street and the East Water Treatment Plant located at 111 South 1st Street.\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy - Water staff is trained in safe chlorine operation and handling procedures and is able to respond to minor leaks.  Staff also performs monthly maintenance and safety checks on the chlorination equipment, and leak detection systems.  The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of Norfolk Fire Division and Elkhorn Valley LEPC, which will notify any potential affected residents in the area.  Chem Trec is contacted by the City to perform the HazMat duties.\n\n2.  Regulated Substance - The East Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine as a disinfectant.  We have one-one ton chlorine cylinder on line at all times and will have one additional one ton cylinder on hand at any given time for a total of two- one ton cylinders on site.\n\n3.  Worse Case Scenario - A possible broken cylinder valve on a one ton chlorine cylinder will release chlorine and can travel a distance of 1.3 miles.  If this type of leakage would occur we would activate the emergency response team to protect the residents in the affected area.  Next step would be to notify Chem Trec response team.\n\n     Alternative Release Scenario - A leaking lead gasket that seals an attached line onto the regulator could possibly release a chlorine vapor cloud at 15 lbs. per minute and can travel a distance of 0.10 miles.  The chlorine cylinders are housed inside a concrete building and are monitored with chlorine gas detectors which activate the when chlorine gas is detected at 1.5 parts per million.  If this type of scenario would occur our trained staff can mitigate the off site consequences.\n\n4.  Five Year Accident History - We have not had any accidental releases in the last fiv"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety - We will keep up with the latest technoligy for safe chlorine use and update procedures as needed. A chlorine scrubber will be installed at this facility by 10/1/1999."
