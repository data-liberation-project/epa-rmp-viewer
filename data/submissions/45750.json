The maximum chlorine stored on site will not exceed 10,000 pounds.  Chlorine is stored in 1 ton cyclinders.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination and is stored in 150 pound cylinders.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored on site is 3900 pounds. In case of a chlorine leak, the City of Oakdale has an emergency response policy which requires the City personnel to notify LA State Police Hazmat by calling the 911 Center.  Local fire and police departments are notified.  These emergency personnel are used to assist in evaluating citizens in the affected area.\n\nThe worse case incident used the EPA's RMP Comp\u00bf  model which projected the release of 2000 pounds of chlorine in ten minutes.  The affected area, 3 miles, included 8541 citizens.  Public facilities such as commercial businesses, industrial businesses, schools, hospital, and prisons are located in the potential affected areas.  The alternative release for chlorine was calculated using the EPA's RMP Comp\u00bf  model.  The model showed 2000 pounds of chlorine released in 13.3 minutes.  The affected area, 0.6 miles, included 8 citizens.  Only residential homes were affected by the release.  \n\nCurrently, the City uses daily inspections and a comprehensive preventative maintenance program to ensure the system is working properly.  There are no active or passive systems being used at the present time other than manual shutoff.  Plant personnel have been properly trained to handle chlorine in one ton cylinders and sulfur dioxide in 150 pound tanks.  Formal and on the job training ensures plant personnel have the necessary knowledge and skill to properly maintain the chlorination and dechlorination system.  \n\nThe City of Oakdale has no history of reportable releases for chlorine or sulfur dioxide at this site.  Three has been no injury or property"
