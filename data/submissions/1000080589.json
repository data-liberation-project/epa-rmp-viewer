Sherwin-Williams does not believe it was the intent of the Clean\r\nAir Act 1990 to cover finished good aerosol storage at warehouse locations. The regulations and\r\nwritten responses from USEPA are unclear as to whether finished good storage is a regulated\r\nprocess under 40 CFR 68. Sherwin-Williams is submitting this plan for compliance purposes only,\r\nand these fillings shall not be construed as an agreement by Sherwin-Williams that these facilities\r\nare covered by the rule. Therefore, Sherwin-Williams reserves its right to withdraw, amend or alter\r\nits plan at any time and to refrain from any future filing under this rule.\r\n\r\nThe Sherwin-Williams Company is committed to protecting the environment, safety and health of our\r\nemployees, customers and the public, and will conduct its business operations in a manner that\r\npromotes obtainment of these objectives. Employees at all levels are accountable for assuring high\r\nstandards of environmental, health and safety compliance and performance. Safety, health and\r\nprotection of the environment will be maintained as integral aspects of all business activities.\r\nThe facility is a distribution warehouse that includes aerosol products. The products may include paint, lubricants, adhesives, cleaners, disinfectants and air fresheners. Propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether (i.e., propellants) are the RMP flammable substances used in the packaging of aerosols. When the propellants in each aerosol container are added together, the amount stored on-site is in excess of the threshold quantity. There are no listed toxic substances handled at this site in excess of the threshold quantity.\r\n\r\nThe worst case scenario is a hypothetical release of any of the hazardous materials listed under\r\nRMP rule as determined by the USEPA. The EPA mandates that companies presume the release of\r\nthe entire quantity of the s"

An example of a passive\r\nsafety control is storage of a limited quantity. The worst case scenario presumes none of the site's\r\nmechanical controls or safety systems requiring energy or human intervention are operational.\r\nThe worst-case release scenario was determined by EPA to be a vapor cloud explosion. This\r\nscenario assumes that the total quantity of the flammable substance in the site's largest storage\r\nvessel (an aerosol container) is released into a vapor cloud, which then explodes. The endpoint for\r\nthe impact zone was determined by EPA to be an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch\r\n(psi) from the explosion of the vapor cloud. The release scenario evaluated using EPA's model,\r\nRMP*Comp, shows no potential for off-site impacts.\r\n\r\nThere has not been an accident or incident that has met the RMP criteria involving propane, butane,\r\nisobutane, or methyl ether at the facility during the last five years. Criteria for RMP reporting are\r\naccidents that have resulted in death, injury, significant property damage, evacuation, sheltering in\r\nplace, or environmental damage. The warehouse has never had a release that caused off-site injury\r\nin its entire history.\r\n\r\nThe site maintains an emergency action plan and has made arrangements for assistance from the\r\nlocal fire department and emergency responders to respond to emergency incidents.\r\n\r\nThe site continually reviews and, if necessary, improves the safety programs and systems at the\r\nfacility."
