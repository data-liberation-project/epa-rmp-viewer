Box 38, Brunswick, Mo.\nContact: \tShane Evans\nPhone: \t660-549-3351\n\n1. The Facility Policy\n\n\tAGRIServices of Brunswick, LLC, and the employees of the AGRIService of Brunswick, LLC - West in Brunswick are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or propane. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Brunswick Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n\tThe primary activity at the facility is the receiving, storage and distribution of bulk dry and liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia for direct application as a crop nutrient. The facility also handles pesticides and grain. Propane is stored for use in heating and grain drying.\n\n\tThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 76,500 pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank. The maximum quantity handled would be the unloading of a transport delivery truck holding approximately 50,000 pounds. The facility also has an 12,000 gallon fixed storage tank. The maximum quantity of propane handled would be 67,000 pounds stored in one 18,000 gallon fixed storage tank.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n\ta. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of  \n     the total contents of the storage tank as follows:\n\n\t   Anhydrous Ammonia - The maximum quantity released would  \n        be 76,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the \n        largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design \n        standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of \n        dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.8 miles.\n\n\t   Propane - The maximum quantity release would be 67,000 \n        pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of 1.0 pounds\n        per square inch, psi, as an explosive vapor cloud) is 0."

The alternate release scenario\u00bfs, based on either the \n     five-year accident history or the most likely potential \n     incident as follows:\n\n\t   Anhydrous Ammonia - Is a release from a break in a 3\u00bf \n        transfer hose followed by release of ammonia for 2 \n        minutes before an automatic or manual shut-off stops the \n        flow. The maximum quantity release would be 26,640 \n        pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion \n        to 200 ppm) is 1.2 miles.\n\n\t   Propane - Is a release from a hose rupture caused by a\n\t   pull-away and assumes a 25 foot length of 4-inch transfer\n        hose. The active mitigation devices are assumed to \n        function as designed, limiting the release to the \n        contents of the hose. The maximum quantity released would\n        be 69 pounds.

The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n\tThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, 1989\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\". It was also reviewed in accordance with the 1992 Edition of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard 58.\n\n5. The Five-year Accident History\n\n\tThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia or propane in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n\tThe facility has;\n\n\ta. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n\t   Standard, 29"
