      "SummaryText": "\nThe City of Vallejo is required to develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) for the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant under U.S. EPA RMP regulations and California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations due to the facility?s use and storage of up to 24,000 pounds of chlorine.  The RMP is subject to Program 3 guidelines because the worst-case release scenario endpoint distance for chlorine exceeds the distance to the nearest public receptor and the quantity of chlorine utilized is sufficient to make the facility subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations administered by U.S. OSHA.  The facility?s RMP consists of an offsite consequence analysis based on the U.S. EPA guidance document and computational modeling, procedures for accidental release reporting, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\nChlorine is added to surface water and finished water treated at the facility in order to ensure purity of the drinking water and to meet California Department of Health Surfaces water treatment regulations by accomplishing the disinfection of any pathogens that might be present in the water supply.  The present chlorination system installed at Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant was designed in 1995 by John Corollo Engineers in accordance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices, federal, state, and local design regulations and codes, and industry-specific design codes and standards.  The system is designed such that all chlorine is conveyed from the storage containers under vacuum created by water flowing through an injector. In the type of chlorination system used at the facility, all chlorine is conveyed under vacuum once it passes the container valves.  This design greatly enhances the overall safety of the system because its check valves and regulator valves will not permit chlorine to be conveyed if the vacuum is lost, as would be the case under most possible failure scenarios.\n"

Up to six additional one-ton containers may be stored in the chlorine room, making the maximum total chlorine inventory 24,000 pounds.  \n\nAs a safeguard against the consequences that may occur due to a chlorine release, a chlorine vapor recovery system is installed that is designed to prevent a significant release of chlorine to the atmosphere.  The vapor recovery system automatically activates when a chlorine leak is detected (>1 ppm), and will remain activated until the detector senses an acceptable vapor level within the Chlorine and Ammonia Building.  The system is rated to reduce the chlorine concentration of air released to the atmosphere such that ground-level chlorine concentrations will not exceed 3 ppm, the level of concern used for the offsite consequence analysis of the RMP.\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant as part of developing the facility?s PSM.  The PHA is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  The PHA focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process.  These considerations assist in determining the hazards and potential failure points or failure modes of a process.  When hazard scenarios are identified, existing or proposed designs and operations are assessed to determine if appropriate engineering and administrative controls are in place.  If the current level of protection is determined insufficient, recommendations are made to eliminate and mitigate the scenarios.\n\nIn order to provide a thorough analysis as specific as possible to the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant, the Hazards and Operability Analysis (HazOp) method, incorporating the guide-word approach, was selected f"

The HazOp Study was conducted on May 5, 1999 by a HazOp Team consisting of two employees of Block Environmental Services, with expertise in the HazOp process, and eight members of the City?s staff, with collective expertise in the engineering, management, operations, maintenance, and health and safety for the City?s water treatment facilities.  The HazOp study was reviewed on May 31, 2005 by three employees of Block Environmental Services and a Fleming Hill WTP employee with expertise in all aspects of the water treatment facility.   \n\nThe PHA also included a seismic review to determine whether the facility and equipment are designed and installed sufficiently to withstand impacts from expected seismic events.  In addition, risks posed by the date change to the year 2000 (Y2K) and possible computer system complications were also assessed as part of the PHA.  Several other external events that might impact the chlorination system were also examined, including fire, power failure, sabotage, flooding, and tornado.\n\nIn general, the HazOp team concluded that engineering controls, safety systems, and procedures in place at the facility achieve the lowest risk practicable for all deviations identified, based on the implementation of two recommended additions to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  The first was to amend the SOP for container changeover at each facility to specify that only the upper, vapor container valve should be connected to the header, including verification that this is the case prior to opening a newly connected container valve.  The second was to amend the chlorine delivery SOP to include a curb check to verify that each container label indicates that it contains chlorine.  These changes were completed in July 1999.  \n\nBecause the flow of vapor chlorine in the system relies on vacuum created by the chlorine injectors, releases from most anticipated failure scenarios will necessarily be limited because regulator valves will automat"

The type of release determined by the PHA to pose the greatest risk is a breakage of a container valve or flexible connector during container changeover.\n\nThe Deputy Water Superintendent is assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.  In addition, a management system is in place for implementing specific elements of the RMP.  The Senior Treatment Plant Operator will implement most of these elements, although specific tasks may be delegated to facility operators and maintenance personnel.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis portion of the RMP involves developing and modeling a worst-case and an alternative theoretical release scenario to estimate the impact an accidental release may have on the public and environment in the surrounding area.  The worst-case release assumes that the maximum amount of chlorine ever held in a single vessel at the facility is released into the atmosphere during meteorological conditions least conducive to expedient dilution of the released gas.  It is intended as a basis of comparison with other facilities, but it is not realistic to expect such a scenario to actually occur.  The alternative scenario was selected based on the PHA conducted for the facility.  It is both a more likely potential release scenario and of sufficient magnitude to reach receptors offsite.   For the alternative release scenario, more representative average daily atmospheric conditions are assumed.  OCA data reported for the RMP is based on data provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, published by U.S. EPA in October of 1998.  The toxic endpoint to be used for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the maximum airborne concentration that most individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms. \n\nThe worst-case relea"

Although the width of the area affected by chlorine concentrations of this magnitude, or footprint, is limited and will only extend downwind from the source, a circle with a 1.6 mile radius is drawn to identify potential offsite impacts.  Using interpolation of 2000 census block group data, it is estimated that 36,790 people live within this radius.  There are eight schools, two hospitals, six parks, one golf course, one cultural center, one community center, and one amusement/theme park and one lake within this radius.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario chosen was identified in the PHA as posing the greatest risk (i.e. highest likelihood of occurrence and severest consequences) out of several release scenarios considered.  It consists of a breakage of the container valve during container changeover due to an operator applying excessive force to the valve in attempting to open it.  The active mitigation provided by the vapor recovery system installed at the Plant must be ignored for the analysis because if it functions as designed, the release would not extend offsite above the endpoint, as required by the regulations.  Taking into account passive mitigation provided by the enclosure of the chlorine room, it is conservatively estimated that 26.9 pounds-per-minute of chlorine is released to the atmosphere over sixty minutes under such a scenario.  The endpoint for this release extends 0.2 miles from the facility.  Using interpolation of 2000 census block group data, it is estimated that 1,460 people live within this radius.  Only one park, and no other public receptors, is located within the alternative scenario endpoint distance.

Furthermore, it is not possible for the entire area within the endpoint circle to experience concentrations of chlorine above the endpoint value, as concentrations of chlorine will only exceed the endpoint within a relatively narrow, oval-shaped footprint.  It should also be reiterated that the vapor recovery system installed at the facility is designed to prevent chlorine from being released above concentrations that would create any offsite impacts, however its function had to be ignored for the OCA.\n\nThe accidental release reporting section of the RMP gives the details and definitions for what must be reported in the event of a significant release of chlorine.  The facility has not had an accidental release of chlorine that resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place in the past five years.\n \nThe prevention program requirements for Program 3 RMPs are taken verbatim from applicable sections of the PSM regulations.  This is a result of U.S. EPA?s recognition that measures taken to reduce and mitigate hazards to facility workers will also serve the same purpose for the surrounding community and environment.  Thus, in order to eliminate redundancy, the PSM is referenced in the RMP.  The PSM consists of several elements that contain or describe procedures that must be implemented on an ongoing basis, including chlorine and process safety information,  process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training, contractor qualification, pre-startup safety reviews, mechanical integrity of equipment, management of change, incident investigation, and injury and illness prevention. \n\nThe intent of the Process Safety Information (PSI) section is to compile system information for use in conducting the Process Hazard Analysis and to help facility operators to identify and understa"

Only one park, and no other public receptors, is located within the alternative scenario endpoint distance.  There are no environmental receptors within this distance.\n\n\n\nIdentifying these potential receptors is only an indication that they could be adversely affected by such a release.  The likelihood, type, or severity of potential impacts on either public or environmental receptors is not assessed in the RMP.  Furthermore, it is not possible for the entire area within the endpoint circle to experience concentrations of chlorine above the endpoint value, as concentrations of chlorine will only exceed the endpoint within a relatively narrow, oval-shaped footprint.  It should also be reiterated that the vapor recovery system installed at the facility is designed to prevent chlorine from being released above concentrations that would create any offsite impacts, however its function had to be ignored"

The facility's RMP consists of an offsite consequence analysis based on the U.S. EPA guidance document and computational modeling, procedures for accidental release reporting, a prevention program, and an emergency response program. \n\n\n\nChlorine is added to surface water and finished water treated at the facility in order to ensure purity of the drinking water and to meet California Department of Health Surfaces water treatment regulations by accomplishing the disinfection of any pathogens that might be present in the water supply.  The present chlorination system installed at Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant was designed in 1995 by John Corollo Engineers in accordance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices, federal, state, and local design regulations and codes, and industry-specific design codes and standards.  The system is designed such that all chlorine is conveyed from the storage containers under vacuum created by water flowing through an injector. In the type of chlorination system used at the facility, all chlorine is conveyed under vacuum once it passes the container valves.  This design greatly enhances the overall safety of the system because its check valves and regulator valves will not permit chlorine to be conveyed if the vacuum is lost, as would be the case under most possible failure scenarios.\n\n\n\nAt most six one-ton chlorine containers can be connected to the chlorination system at a time.  Up to six additional one-ton containers may be stored in the chlorine room, making the maximum total chlorine inventory 24,000 pounds.  \n\n\n\nAs a safeguard against the consequences that may occur due to a chlorine release, a chlorine vapor recovery system is installed that is designed to prevent a significant release of chlorine to the atmosphere.

The system is rated to reduce the chlorine concentration of air released to the atmosphere such that ground-level chlorine concentrations will not exceed 3 ppm, the level of concern used for the offsite consequence analysis of the RMP.\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted for the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant as part of developing the facility's PSM.  The PHA is an organized and systematic effort to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing or handling of highly hazardous chemicals.  The PHA focuses on equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions (routine and non-routine), and external factors that might impact the process.  These considerations assist in determining the hazards and potential failure points or failure modes of a process.  When hazard scenarios are identified, existing or proposed designs and operations are assessed to determine if appropriate engineering and administrative controls are in place.  If the current level of protection is determined insufficient, recommendations are made to eliminate and mitigate the scenarios.\n\n\n\nIn order to provide a thorough analysis as specific as possible to the Fleming Hill Water Treatment Plant, the Hazards and Operability Analysis (HazOp) method, incorporating the guide-word approach, was selected for the PHA.  The HazOp Study was conducted on May 5, 1999 by a HazOp Team consisting of two employees of Block Environmental Services, with expertise in the HazOp process, and eight members of the City's staff, with collective expertise in the engineering, management, operations, maintenance, and health and safety for the City's water treatment facilities.

In addition, risks posed by the date change to the year 2000 (Y2K) and possible computer system complications were also assessed as part of the PHA.  Several other external events that might impact the chlorination system were also examined, including fire, power failure, sabotage, flooding, and tornado.\n\n\n\nIn general, the HazOp team concluded that engineering controls, safety systems, and procedures in place at the facility achieve the lowest risk practicable for all deviations identified, based on the implementation of two recommended additions to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  The first was to amend the SOP for container changeover at each facility to specify that only the upper, vapor container valve should be connected to the header, including verification that this is the case prior to opening a newly connected container valve.  The second was to amend the chlorine delivery SOP to include a curb check to verify that each container label indicates that it contains chlorine.  These changes were completed in July 1999.  \n\n\n\nBecause the flow of vapor chlorine in the system relies on vacuum created by the chlorine injectors, releases from most anticipated failure scenarios will necessarily be limited because regulator valves will automatically close upon the loss of vacuum that would accompany a release.  The type of release determined by the PHA to pose the greatest risk is a breakage of a container valve or flexible connector during container changeover.\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Water Superintendent is assigned overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.

The worst-case release assumes that the maximum amount of chlorine ever held in a single vessel at the facility is released into the atmosphere during meteorological conditions least conducive to expedient dilution of the released gas.  It is intended as a basis of comparison with other facilities, but it is not realistic to expect such a scenario to actually occur.  The alternative scenario was selected based on the PHA conducted for the facility.  It is both a more likely potential release scenario and of sufficient magnitude to reach receptors offsite.   For the alternative release scenario, more representative average daily atmospheric conditions are assumed.  OCA data reported for the RMP is based on data provided in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, published by U.S. EPA in October of 1998.  The toxic endpoint to be used for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the maximum airborne concentration that most individuals could be exposed to for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release is predicted to reach the toxic endpoint at a distance of 1.6 miles from the facility.  Although the width of the area affected by chlorine concentrations of this magnitude, or footprint, is limited and will only extend downwind from the source, a circle with a 1.6 mile radius is drawn to identify potential offsite impacts.
