We firmly believe that we can operate our processes without inuring or endangering employees or the community. \n\nOur policy for process safety management is to comply with INVISTA Process Safety Management Standard, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68). INVISTA?s Risk Management Program contains the management systems and controls for our diversified processes so that potential hazards are identified, understood, and controlled. It is the responsibility of each individual employee to know, understand, and comply with the site process safety management policy and systems. \n\nManagement ensures that employees are involved in all aspects of the Risk Management reviews, auditing, and\ndevelopment of procedures and training programs.\n\n\n1.1 THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe INVISTA Orange Site is located approximately 2 miles South of the city of Orange on FM 1006. The site is located on 72 acres and the facility is secured by a chain-link fence, video cameras, controlled entry, and a 24 hour security force. DuPont as the land owner is responsible for security and emergency response for the site.\n\nThe site consists of manufacturing processes to produce Nylon Intermediates [hexamethylenediamine (HMD), adipic acid (Adipure), and Adiponitrile (ADN)]. In the production of these products, the following regulated substances are used as"

The PSM and RMP programs share common accidental release prevention requirements and corresponding program elements. In complying with the PSM standard, INVISTA has taken the necessary steps to comply with the applicable accidental release prevention requirements of the RMP regulation.\n\nINVISTA?s Accidental Release Prevention Program incorporates safety into process and equipment designs:\n- A documented process technology system covers hazards of materials, equipment design basis, and process design basis.\n- Extensive accident prevention and mitigation systems are strategically located.\n- Applicable codes and standards are met or exceeded.\n- Materials of construction are chosen to provide mechanical integrity.\n- Quality Assurance ensures fabrication in accordance with design specifications and proper assembly.\n\nINVISTA maintains the regulated processes with safety in mind:\n- Maintenance personnel are qualified and trained.\n- Contractors are trained and qualified.\n- A work permit system controls hazards.\n- All non-replacements-in-kind (non-RIK) changes are documented through site Management of Change (MOC) procedure.\n\nINVISTA incorporates safety into regulated process operations:\n- Operators are trained and job qualified.\n- Technical resources are available and utilized as required.\n- Operators follow approved procedures.\n\nINVISTA audits the prevention program and its implementation:\n- Routine safety inspections are conducted.\n- Corporate, independent and governmental audits and reviews are conducted.\n- Process Hazards Analyses are conducted.\n- Safety equipment are set up on a periodic inspection frequency to ensure ongoing mechanical integrity"

INVISTA has a service level agreement with DuPont. Key program provisions include:\n- Plant personnel receive emergency response training.\n- Plant emergency responders, including INVISTA and DuPont personnel, are trained.\n- Emergency response plans are current.\n- Plant participates in emergency drills.\n- Critiques are held on drills and actual events.\n- Plant is a member of the Orange County Local Emergency Planning Committee.\n\nIf a major release occurs, the following actions are taken:\n- Emergency alarm is sounded.\n- Community emergency responders are notified as appropriate.\n- Emergency communicated to DuPont, which activates the Plant Emergency Operating Center.\n- Plant Incident Commander and emergency squad respond.\n\n\n1.5 PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \n\nThrough process hazard analyses, INVISTA has developed actions and implementation schedules for improving the safety of its regulated processes. The list of actions and implementation schedule are presented in PHA reports maintained in facility files."
