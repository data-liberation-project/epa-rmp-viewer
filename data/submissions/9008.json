      "SummaryText": "The Kaneka Delaware Corporation facility located in Delaware City, Delaware is one of several facilities throughout the world that are owned and operated by the Japan-based Kaneka Corporation.  The Kaneka Delaware Corporation plant produces polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, a non-hazardous plastic material used in a diverse range of applications. We take pride in ensuring that the plant is designed and operated to prevent hazards in our workplace, and maintain well established contingency plans in place in the unlikely event of a mishap.  \n\nControlling risks from hazardous substances is a major part of our \"Quality Policy\", which states:\n\n\"Kaneka Delaware Corporation will continually strive to produce the highest quality specialty PVC resins, at competitive prices, while maintaining product service, and customer satisfaction. Our commitment to total quality will emphasize a continuous improvement of our processes, the health and safety of our employees and customers, and responsible concern for our environment and our communities.\"\n\nTo ensure that we operate according to this policy, we have programs in place that provide layers of protection to prevent releases and protect the public and environment, including:\n\n- A management system that is conforming to ISO-9002 International Standards; and\n- Coordination of our emergency contingency plans with local response agencies.\n\nHazard Assessments\n\nThe Kaneka Delaware Corporation facility handles vinyl chloride monomer, which is an EPA-regulated flammable substance.  This substance is present in quantities exceeding the regulatory threshold. We have assessed the risks that our handling and storage of the substance could present to public health or the environment by performing offsite consequence analyses in \"worst case\" and \"alternative release\" scenarios.  \n\nOur hazard assessment of the offsite consequences determined that the worst case flammable release would be represented by the complete loss, with vapor cloud explo"

      "SummaryText": "sion, of the contents of two interconnected vinyl chloride monomer storage vessels. Although very unlikely to occur, this scenario could result in a release of 2,000,000 pounds of vinyl chloride monomer.  The resulting plume could affect a portion of an area within 0.8 miles of the facility before being reduced below one psi overpressure condition.  This area includes an estimated residential population of 2,900 persons, residences, and major commercial, office and industrial areas. \n\nOur analysis of release scenarios also includes a more credible situation that reflects actual operating conditions. This analysis has determined that such releases could impact a portion of an area within 0.1 miles of our facility.  The estimated residential population within this area is zero. Public receptors identified include major commercial, office and industrial buildings. \n\nAccident History\n\nNo accidents meeting the regulatory definition found in 40 CFR Part 68 took place at the Kaneka Delaware Corporation facility during the five years immediately prior to the date of this report.\n\nEmergency Response\n\nContingency plans are in place at our facility for responding to accidental releases, treating any persons who have been affected by a hazardous substance, and rapidly informing local response agencies.  Our emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Delaware City Fire Department.\n\nOperations at the Kaneka Delaware Corporation facility are  periodically reviewed by plant management to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.  As methods for safer operation are identified, they are evaluated and implemented, if applicable.   In this way we will continue to maintain a high standard for safety and environmental protection."
