This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To save lives.\r\n2. To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3. To protect the environment.\r\n4. To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe operator of the facility maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.

This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year. This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nIn the event of an ammonia emergency, Fowler Packing plans to evacuate all employees in the facility and alert the local emergency responders (fire department). The operator of the facility plans to coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP regulation defines accident as the following: \r\n\r\nThe release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.
