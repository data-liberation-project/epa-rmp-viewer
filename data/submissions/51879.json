Our products are used to produce a wide variety of products including cosmetics, paints, cleaners, tires and water treatment products.  \n\nCertain substances used and produced within the facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) Rule.  \n\nDimethylamine, ethylene oxide, isopropylamine and ethylamine are used as process feedstocks.  These substances are present at or above the minimum threshold for RMP applicability.\n\n   \nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. has a prevention program in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910. 119) and the EPA Risk Management P"

      "SummaryText": "rogram.  This prevention program covers those processes that handle covered chemicals above the threshold quantity of either the PSM or RMP rules.\n\nThe prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents.  Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n -In-depth process hazard analyses are completed at least every five years by qualified personnel using techniques approved under the OSHA PSM standards;\n\n -Written operating procedures are used for training and directing the work of operators, who receive refresher training every three years;\n\n -Operators, mechanics, and contractor personnel are qualified, trained in the general hazards in the facility, and informed of any temporary situations affecting safety;\n\n -A safety work permit system assures that work is done safely and properly;\n\n -A management system is in place to ensure that changes are managed safely;\n\n -Critical equipment, including instruments, is inspected on a planned, periodic basis to assure proper operating conditions;\n\n -Pre-startup reviews are done to ensure that conditions for safe operation have been satisfied prior to starting new or modified equipment;\n\n -Incidents, including near-misses, are investigated and actions are taken as part of a continuous improvement effort; \n\n -Routine audits are conducted to assure that safe practices are being followed;\n\n -Periodic process walk-through inspections are conducted by supervisors; and\n\n -Routine safety meetings are held where managers and hourly participate.\n\nThis systematic approach to process safety involves employees and strives for continuing improvements in accident reduction.  The training, qualifications, and safety awareness of our operations, maintenance, and emergency response personnel are a key element in reducing and mitigating accidents.\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  Worst-Case Scenarios\n\nMeasures that would prevent worst-case scenarios for ethylene oxide and isopropylamine include:"

      "SummaryText": "\n\n -The tanks are pressure vessels which are designed and constructed in accordance with industry pressure vessel standards using industry-standard materials of construction;\n\n -As part of the Mechanical Integrity program, and per DOT requirements pressure vessels are periodically inspected and tested;\n\n -The risk of over-pressure is addressed by a system of pressure relief valves installed on the vessels;\n\n -Access to the facility is restricted through security barriers and trained security personnel, thereby minimizing the risk to the tanks of vehicular damage or sabotage;\n\n - Fire hazards are controlled through procedures, training, and the hot work permit system; and\n\n -Continuous observation is required during the unloading of any toxic gas (ethylene oxide) per DOT requirements. \n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:  Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nPrevention measures for the alternative scenarios selected for ethylene oxide and dimethylamine include:\n\n -Railcar and tank truck stops (or wheel chocks) to prevent movement of a railcar or tank truck;\n\n -Signage that indicates railcar unloading;\n\n -Careful control of the switching of railcars, including proper training and procedures that prohibit hooking up to a car that is still connected;\n\n -Replacing flexible hose connections and railcar fittings on a frequent basis to ensure hoses are always in good condition;\n\n -Frequent inspection of unloading lines to ensure the lines are in good condition; and\n\n -Control of fire hazards through procedures, training, and the hot work permit system (dimethylamine).\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no incidents that meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History  in the last five years.  \n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc.realizes that the community may also be interested in information on how it responds to smaller releases of regulated chemicals that do not meet EPA criteria for the Five-Year Accident History.  We have been diligent in reporting releases of haz"

The plan was developed in cooperation and was coordinated with the community emergency response plan developed under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The Wayne County Local Emergency Planning Committee, local fire departments, and other emergency responders have copies of these plans.  \n\nThe emergency response plan includes procedures for notifying civil authorities and the public in the event of an incident.  The plan also includes documentation of proper first-aid and medical treatment necessary to treat accidental human exposures; procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and for its inspection and testing; a description of the training program for employees in relevant emergency response procedures; and procedures for review and update of the emergency response plan to reflect changes at the facility, and to ensure that employees are informed of these changes.  \n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. also has an on-site Emergency Response Team that performs regular emergency response drills and critiques of the drills.  Some drills are done with the local fire and police departments and critiqued by members of the community.  Taminco Higher Amines, Inc. on-site emergency equipment includes a fully equipped fire truck with fire fighting foam capability and a 2,000-gallon vacuum truck for quickly collecting spills.  There are first-aid trained personnel on each shift.  The Taminco Higher Amines, Inc. Emergency Response Team receives over 40 hours of annual emergency response training. \n\n  \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nTaminco Higher Amines, Inc. has recently revised the software system used to track incidents and near-misses, and to track actions being taken to prevent recurrences and improve preventions systems."
