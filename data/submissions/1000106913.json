LES is a publicly owned electric utility with sole service responsibility in and around Lincoln, Nebraska. As a public owned utility, LES operates and maintains all of the equipment in our system in a manner representing prudent utility practices and in conformance with the expectations of LES customers and owners. LES strives for excellence in the facility operations and for full compliance with all local, state, and federal laws and regulations. \n\nMeeting environmental requirements is part of LES business practices and by maintaining this Risk Management Program, LES is complying with the Federal Accident Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68) and the Risk Management Program defined in it. LES is committed to the accidental release prevention program and also maintains a detailed Emergency Response Plan designated specifically for the Terry Bundy Generating Station. This plan is routinely reviewed with HAZMAT responder organizations.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe Terry Bundy Generating Station is equipped with three landfill gas fired generators and three LM 6000 dual fuel aeroderivative combustion turbines, one of which operates in simple cycle, and two operate in either simple cycle or combined cycle with a steam turbine. The turbines are equipment with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for NOx emission control. This system uses anhydrous ammonia which is fed into the exhaust combustion gases upstream of the SCR catalyst modules. The total quantity of anhydrous ammonia onsite exceeds EPA\u0092s RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nLES has a program in p"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nSafety Information [40 CFR Part 68.48]\nLES maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nHazard Review [40 CFR Part 68.50]\nComprehensive analyses ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The studies ensure processes are designed, fabricated, and operated in accordance with the applicable standards. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.52]\nTo ensure safe operations, LES  maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.54]\nLES has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMaintenance [40 CFR Part 68.56]\nLES carries out documented maintenance checks and inspections on process equipment to ensure proper operations.

These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.60]\nLES promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nThe facility\u0092s RMP process has had no RMP-reportable accidents in the past 5 years.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nIn the event of an incident, LES has systems in place to respond quickly. Processes can be shut down on an emergency basis and the facility has a plan in place for evacuations, adequate first aid, and medical treatment and notification of local emergency response agencies. The facility is a responding facility, with trained personnel to respond in the event of an emergency and utilizes an Emergency Response Plan to document procedures for responding in the event of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.
