Cerveceria India has implemented safety features to protect the health of ours employees and the community in self.  We build a secure ammonia cylinder storage building that would protect the people around it in case of an accident.\nOurs employees has trainings specialized to respond to any emergency in side of the facility to prevent and minimize the risk of casualties in and outside the facilities.  We also have monitoring equipment that detect any leaks in our system, complemented with alarms and visual signals that warning our personal to evacuated to the designated areas as soonest possible.\nThe worst case scenario that we present in our RMP is the release of the entire ammonia refrigeration system finding that in a release of 10 minutes, we have offsite impact in a radio of .5 miles.  In the alternative case scenario, using pressurized vessel with a hole of 6: and 5 minutes of leak, we don?t have offsite impact because the ammonia would stay inside the building.\nCerveceria India is in compliance with different federal regimentation such as CAA title v, Clean Water Act and different local agencies as Environmental Quality Board and the different departments, Sewer and Aqueduct Authority.\nCerveceria India had not report any accident in the last 5 years.
