Plant #25 are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive safety program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities consist of rail car maintenance and repair.  Railroad tank cars containing residual amounts of anhydrous ammonia, LPG, and butadiene are occasionally received.  These substances are flared prior to cleaning and repair of the rail cars.        \n\nThe maximum potential  inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) that is expected to be present in this facility is 1,485,000 lb. while 1,3-Butadiene and Propane are expected to be present at our facility in maximum potential quantities of 1,458,000 lb. and 1,134,000 lb,. respectively.  While these quantities represent potential maximum inventories, normal inventories are expected to be much less.\n\n3. Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios\nFor all worst case and alternative release scenarios, we have used EPA's RMP*Comp(TM) to determine the distance to endpoint for chemical releases and Landview III for population estimates.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances involves the catastrophic release of a rail car full of anhydrous ammonia.  In this scenario 148,500 lb. of anhydrous ammonia is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporat"

At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 6.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves a release from a rail car containing anhydrous ammonia.  The scenario involves the release of 100 lb. of anhydrous ammonia over a period of 10 minutes due to a leaking hose.  The release is assumed to be terminated by operator response.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of anhydrous ammonia is 0.1 miles.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves the catastrophic release of rail car full of 1,3-Butadiene.  In this scenario 145,800 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene is released.  The release quantity has been limited to 90% of the maximum capacity due to administrative controls.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.42 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nThe alternative release scenario submitted for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from a rail car containing 1,3-Butadiene.  The release is assumed to result in a vapor cloud explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 10,000 lb. of 1,3-Butadiene in 10 minutes.  The release is terminated by operator response.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammale endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.08 miles.\n\n4.\tThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements"

Plant #25 maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with the covered process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility has conducted a comprehensive study to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses was What If/Checklist (combined).  This study was undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and will be revalidated at a minimum interval of 5 years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/05/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Trinity Industries, Inc. Plant #25 maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nTrinity Industries, Inc. Plant #25 has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nTrinity Industries, Inc. Plant #25 performs maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance inspections are performed by qualified personnel with previous training i"

Plant #25 to perform pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nTrinity Industries, Inc. Plant #25 conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  The most recent comliance audit was conducted on 11/03/1999.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are addressed in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nTrinity Industries, Inc. Plant #25 promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nTrinity Industries, Inc. Plant #25 truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.
