During a release the ammonia will pool in the containment area and then flow immediately through the gravity fed drain into the ditch.  The function of the containment is two-fold:  First, it will minimize the exposed surface area available for vaporization, decreasing the release rate;  and secondly, it will direct the liquid ammonia into the process water ditch where it will solubilize in the water.  The containment also is equipped with a deluge system that upon activation will spray water down over the containment area.  This will scrub most of the vaporous ammonia from the air and will also promote pooling of the ammonia in the containment area.  The deluge water will also aid in flushing the pooled ammonia from the containment area into the process water ditch.  The ammonia storage and distribution system is also equipped with self-closing excess flow valves.  These excess flow valves are designed to limit or halt ammonia flow should a failure occur in the unloading or distribution systems. These mitigation systems will significantly reduce the distance to the toxic endpoint and hence, make the worst-case scenario very unlikely.\n\nThe alternative release scenario was determined by assuming a transfer line is severed causing the release of 12,600 pounds of anhydrous ammonia over a 10 minute period.  The modeling presumes there is no passive mitigation systems in place.  Under this scenario the release would be terminated by manually closing an emergency valve.  Using a wind speed of two meters per second, the distance to the endpoint concentration was determined to be 0.43 miles from the Mulberry facility.  At this distance the endpoint would be contained onsite in all directions except to the north where it would reach just beyond State Road 60 East.

The three manufacturing plants are the sulfuric acid plant (SAP), the phosphoric acid plant (PAP), and the granular fertilizer plant (fertilizer plant).  Each of the plant's process descriptions has been provided below.\n\nSulfuric acid is produced from elemental sulfur.  Sulfur is burned in a furnace to produce sulfur dioxide gas.  Then by use of a catalyst, sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfur trioxide, which is also a gas.  Sulfur trioxide gas is absorbed into a stream of recirculating sulfuric acid thereby increasing the acid strength.  Water is added to the strengthened acid causing a decrease of strength and increase in volume.  The extra volume is removed as product from the recirculation circuit.\n\nHeat from the burning of elemental sulfur and from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide is captured.  The captured heat is used to produce steam that is utilized in two fashions.  Electricity is generated from the majority of the steam at a on-site turbine driven generator.  The remaining steam is utilized in tube and shell evaporators located in the PAP.\n\nSulfuric acid produced on-site or from external sources is then pumped from storage tanks to the  PAP and reacted with mined phosphate rock producing a slurry containing a diluted form of phosphoric acid (28-30% P2O5) and a solid by-product, phosphogypsum.  The phosphogypsum is filtered from the phosphoric acid and conveyed to an adjacent aboveground storage site.  The phosphoric acid is concentrated through evaporation to increase its strength to 40-42% P2O5, stored, and then utilized in the fertilizer plant.  \n\nAt the fertilizer plant, phosphoric acid is neutralized with another raw material, anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), to form a slurry that is granulated and dried to form the facility's primary product, diammonium phosphate fertilizer (DAP).

Up to 250 tons of ammonia may be stored at the facility.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis:\n\n40 CFR part 68  Subpart B requires facilities that store over 10,000 pounds of ammonia to prepare an Off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA).  The OCA includes both a Worst Case Scenario analysis and an Alternative Release Scenario analysis utilizing physical parameters determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The OCA for the MPI facility was determined using the HGSYSTEM model and was prepared by an independent consulting firm.\n\nThe HGSYSTEM model estimates a distance to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l (200 ppm) for ammonia. The toxic endpoint concentration of 200 ppm has been set by EPA in regulations found at 40 CFR 68 Appendix A.  The data to support the toxic endpoint of 200 ppm is provided by reference by EPA.\n\nThe worst case scenario was determined by assuming 500,000 pounds of  ammonia is released in vaporous form from two interconnected tanks over a 10 minute period.
