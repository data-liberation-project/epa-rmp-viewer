It takes into account safe practices such as emergency shut-off valves, alarms, safety interlocks and protection systems.  Average area weather conditions are used.  Based on the hazard analysis evaluations of the three systems (ammonia, chlorine and sulfur dioxide), the most likely cause of a release was determined to be a piping system failure.  This type of failure will result in the release of 200, 160 or 240 pounds of ammonia, chlorine or sulfur dioxide respectively, over a 20 minutes period of time.  These types of releases were determined to have an off-site impact using the EPA Guidance Reference Tables.\n\nUnder the EPA Risk Management Program requirements, no ammonia or sulfur dioxide related incident with off-site or on-site impact has occurred during the past five years.  For chlorine, two site employees have  required minor medical treatment and no incident with off-site impact has occurred in the past five years. \n\nCincinnati Specialties, LLC is always working to reduce potential risk associated with handling the above chemicals.  Examples include reduction of the ammonia inventory on site with the design and installation of a single tank, rather than a dual tank, storage facility.  The reduced volume system operates under lower pressure conditions with enhanced process controls and alarms as well as automatic and remote system shutoffs.  Similarly, the sulfur dioxide storage system pressure was reduced and the unloading system was simplified.  For Chlorine, upgrades to the storage facility included equipment design that minimizes the amount of chlorine that can potentially be released from the system.  Also, process alarms with automatic and remote shutoff capability have been added to minimize releases.  Cincinnati Specialties, LLC is currently exploring the feasibility of adding an enclosure around the chlorine storage facility as well as a larger scrubber to further reduce potent"

Final products produced include high intensity sweeteners, corrosion inhibitors and specialty chemical intermediates.  Some of these products are used to improve consumer products by enhancing flavor and fragrance.  Others are used to extend the useful life of metals by preventing corrosion.  Raw materials used in the manufacturing of the site's products include organic chemicals, caustic, acids and alcohol.  Three of the raw materials (ammonia, chlorine and sulfur dioxide) are reportable under the EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP).\n\nAccident prevention and emergency response programs for the hazardous materials used on site have been in existence for many years.  The fourteen elements of OSHA's (Occupational Safety and Health Association) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29CFR1910.119), established in 1992, are an integral part of our operations.  Equipment is designed, fabricated and installed to meet established industry standards and codes. Hazard analysis studies to identify potential risks, their causes, and to institute safeguards to prevent accidental releases of chemicals have been completed, and are being revalidated every five years.  Preventive maintenance of the equipment is handled by skilled on site maintenance department personnel.  Critical equipment is included in a computerized mandatory maintenance program to assure its mechanical integrity.  Certified process operators are trained in routine, emergency and process safety procedures.  They use automated controls and alarms, leak detection systems, regular inspections and standardized written procedures to monitor the plant.  Functioning process areas are staffed continuously and overseen by experienced site Supervisors.  Any maintenance repair or operating procedure that deviates from established standards is reviewed, and if deemed acceptable, approved using the"

Work activity with the potential to cause a safety hazard must have special work permits and safety approvals.\n\nTo minimize the impact in the event of an accidental chemical release, processes are equipped with emergency shutdown, fail safe, and fire protection systems.   A written facility Emergency Response Plan detailing the responsibilities of the on-site response team has been in place for many years.  Annual emergency response training is conducted on site.  The site has a facility-wide emergency notification system, including process alarms, speakers, radios and cellular phones.  Plant Operators are trained as OSHA Emergency First Responders and all production Supervisors are trained as OSHA On-Scene Incident Commanders.  The company maintains specialized equipment for responding to chemical releases and conducts annual emergency drills with the fire department to maintain skills and coordination.   The site has a 24-hour security staff.  Emergency Response is coordinated with the St. Bernard Fire Department.  If necessary, the Public would be notified of an emergency through the St. Bernard Fire and Police Departments using the Hamilton County Emergency Communication System.\n\nThe worst-case EPA scenario assumes the release of the entire content of a railcar, 180,000 pounds, of liquid chlorine over 10 minutes.  The release occurs under very stagnant, worst-case (highest outside temperature, minimal air dilution) weather conditions.  In addition, there is a complete failure of all safety systems and emergency response actions at the facility.  The release travels in a straight line in any possible direction resulting in potential off-site exposure within a circle of impact as determined from the EPA Guidance Reference Tables.  The edge of the circle, or endpoint, represents the material concentration that people can be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.    \n\nThe alternative-case sce"
