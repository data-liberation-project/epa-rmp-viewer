Written operating procedures have been developed for all chlorine operations.\n4. Employees working with the chlorine process are required to undergo comprehensive training.\n5.

An incident investigation protocol is in place.\n\n\n\n\nWVSA has developed a written emergency action plan and coordinates response activities with the Hanover Township Fire Department annually at minimum. Employees receive training in this plan and its provisions are reviewed/drilled periodically. WVSA is considered a non-responding facility. If an emergency involving the chlorine process were to occur, WVSA employees are trained to take incipient stage action in an effort to control the situation however, if incipient stage actions are insufficient, employees are to evacuate and contact the local responders including Hanover Township Fire Department who will take command of the situation.\n\nThis facility has not had an accident involving chlorine which has resulted in deaths, injuries, property/environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place within the previous 5 years of operation.\n\nWVSA is constantly refining and improving its safety programs and actively seeks employee input and suggestions.

      "SummaryText": "Wyoming Valley Sanitary Authority (WVSA) is a publicly owned wastewater treatment facility that processes, treats, and disinfects stormwater runoff and wastewater from homes, industries, schools, and businesses in the Luzerne County area. The overall water treatment process includes many steps and uses a variety of chemicals to remove solids, organic matter, and other pollutants from the water to achieve the necessary purity. One chemical used as a primary disinfectant, chlorine, is identified by EPA as a hazardous chemical that may pose a toxicity concern if mishandled. WVSA has developed a comprehensive, written Risk Management Plan (RMP), compliant with EPA requirements, to ensure that the chlorine process is designed, operated, and maintained safely such that the potential for a significant release is minimized.\n\nChlorine is supplied to WVSA in 1-ton cylinders. Chlorine vapor is drawn from one cylinder at a time and injected into water lines using two chlorinators. The chlorinators control the total injection rate and ensure the appropriate concentration is injected into the pre-treated water.\n\nThe chlorine process has been designed and installed in accordance with Chlorine Institute guidelines. The Chlorine Institute guidelines are considered the recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) for chlorine storage and injection processes. These guidelines include a number of engineered and operational safety recommendations that have been incorporated into WVSA's process design and procedures. A brief description of some of the most relevant follows:\n\n1. All chlorine operations are conducted within sealed enclosures with strict access control.\n2. All chlorine is delivered in isolated 1 ton cylinders and no chlorine filling operations occur onsite.\n3. The total number of chlorine cylinders stored is minimized to the extent feasible to ensure continued operation.\n4. The enclosures include atmospheric monitoring devices that alarm when chlor"
