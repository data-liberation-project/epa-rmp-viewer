      "SummaryText": "The Pickett Cooperatives, Inc., Eldorado Farm Center, Eldorado, Wisconsin supplies anhydrous ammonia directly to farmers who use it as a fertilizer.  We receive the anhydrous ammonia and store it in steel tanks prior to retail sale.  We follow the pressure vessel regulations administered by the State of Wisconsin Department of Commerce, worker-safety regulations administered by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the federal Program 2 Prevention Program regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to prevent anhydrous ammonia leaks or accidents.   We coordinate our emergency plans with the Fond du Lac County Emergency Government and the Eldorado Fire Department through an offsite emergency plan, onsite tours, and discussions.  Alternative and worst-case release scenarios have been completed for anhydrous ammonia.  Contact us if you would like to review or discuss these scenarios.  No accidents that are reportable under the EPA?s Risk Management regulation (40 CFR 68.42) have occurred in the last five years.  We are continuously reviewing and upgrading our safety, health, and environmental programs."
