The only difference includes: An algorithm is used to estimate the ethylene oxide concentration in the reactor to prevent entering the flammable range during the reaction. This hazard does not exist for propylene oxide. Reactor 22R-503 uses redundant temperature and pressure instruments as inputs for the algorithm. Reactor 22R-501 and 22R-502 use a vapor space analyzer as back-up for the ethylene oxide flammable limit algorithm.",

Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  This is referred to as a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).\n\nThe Millsdale Plant primarily uses the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Hazard Evaluation Procedure to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team?s findings are summarized in a report and communicated to plant management and all employees associated with the process.   Implementation of the findings is based on relative risk ranking parameters assigned by the PHA team.  The risk ranking helps assure the findings with the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All PHA findings are tracked until completion.  \n\nTo help ensure that process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Millsdale Plant revalidates the process hazards analysis on a five (5) year frequency for the entire life of the process in accordance with the PSM regulation.  The findings from the revalidations are managed in the same fashion as for the original hazard analysis.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Stepan Company?s Millsdale Plant maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations such as:\n\n?
