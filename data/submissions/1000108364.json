As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of these chemicals. Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of these covered systems as well as proper operator training for those who maintain the systems.\n\n\tOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the Process Safety Management (PSM) Program and Risk Management Plan for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devises inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law.\n\n\tOur emergency response plan is incorporated in the Emergency Response Plan and the Hazardous Materials Management Plan for this plant.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders and a specific protocol for evacuation due to a release.  The Plan assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.
