This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our objective is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery, located in Benicia, California, U.S.A., operates a variety of processes to produce petroleum products (e.g., propane, butane, gasoline products, jet fuels, diesel fuels, asphalt and coke) from raw crude oil.  The refinery has several regulated flammables, such as propane, butane, etc.  In addition, the refinery uses and/or processes anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia (>20%), which are toxic regulated substances. The Refinery contains a total of eight covered processes for the purposes of this plan.  The predictive filing box was marked for anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EVENTS ANALYSIS \r\n\r\nThe refinery is subject to external events, which may cause the release of hazardous materials.  The refinery is designed and operated in such a way as to minimize the probability and the impact of such events.  External events considered in the design and operation of the refinery include, but are not limited to: security, temperature extremes, earthquake, winds, precipitation, utility disruption, and wildland fires.  \r\n\r\nOf particular interest is the earthquake suscept"

In all cases, the normal paraffinic component is less dense but has a higher energy value than the olefins or isomers, and therefore, represents a more conservative case.\r\n\r\nAdditional details are included in the Data Element section of this RMPlan.  Due to the ongoing nature of our safety program, the dates associated with the various activities in our accident prevention program are constantly changing.  To minimize rework, October 7, 2016 (estimated 45 days prior to expected submittal date)was selected as the date to end collecting information regarding the 2016 voluntary update resubmission.  Consequently, most of the reviews/updates conducted after that date are not reflected in the Data Element information.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to the information used to create the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of safety committees and forums that employees can use to address their process and personnel safety issues. The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\r\n\r\nThe refinery attained the California OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star status in 2006.

Additionally, most of the refinery processing and storage areas are on solid rock, which limits the severity of ground motion. Additions and significant modifications to the Refinery since that time have been done using the codes and technology applicable at the time of construction of those projects.  Even prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, the refinery had conducted independent assessments of risks associated with lateral ground motion.  Although there will be damage to refinery equipment from a worst credible earthquake, studies have indicated that catastrophic loss of containment should not be a concern.  \r\n\r\nWith the advent of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, the refinery has done detailed evaluations of its physical security facilities and associated security plans.  Both have been significantly updated to address issues identified in these evaluations, and they meet all federal requirements for marine and fuels terminals.  In addition, the refinery has maintained strong links with local and national law enforcement agencies to ensure good coordination in the event of an incident.  \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at the Valero Benicia Refinery.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements are met because all Program Level 3 processes at the refinery are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\r\n\r\nThe refinery is focused on fuels production and most of the light hydrocarbons are used in mixtures and are not recovered as pure components.  Isomers and olefins of propane and butane origin are mixed without regard to the specific components, because they all behave similarly in their use as fuel.  Where we had specific gas chromatograph information on the species of the hydrocarbon compounds, these have be"

The Benicia refinery has retained its' VPP Star status since that time, being recertified in March, 2014 for the next 3 years. A review of the PSM systems were included as part of each VPP recertification review.\r\n\r\nThe refinery implemented a behavior based safety program called Safety Needs Active Participation (SNAP) in 2005.  The purpose of this program is to reduce at-risk behaviors and remove barriers to safe behaviors, thus improving safety performance.  Peer observations are anonymous and confidential.  The SNAP observers strive to be safety role models supporting continuous improvement processes at Valero Benicia Refinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific groups within the refinery are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the PSM documentation to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs).  This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery primarily uses the guideword based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study methodology.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are reviewed with local management for resolution.

Implementation of such modifications may extend well into the future and are subject to change.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Valero Benicia Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and resolution of the findings is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Safe Work Practices\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3), normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators.  The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.

New employees receive basic training in refinery operations and safety.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with an experienced operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After employees demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  In addition, all operations personnel periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.  All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery uses contractors to supplement its' workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work to support on-going operations and on or near process equipment, the refinery has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform refinery personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.  A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe Valero Benicia Refinery has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to refinery management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are communicated to employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.
