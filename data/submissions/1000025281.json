The legal location is in NW1/4 NW1/4 of Section 23, Township 153N, Range 91W. \n\n\n\nGeneric Process Description:\n\nThe plant processes natural gas delivered from wells.  The plant processes consists of separation of natural gas liquids (NGL).  The NGL product is stored in up to twelve(12) NGL storage tanks, including eight(8) 90,000 gal tanks and three(3) 30,000 gal tanks.  The NGL product is sold and shipped via truck.\n\n\n\nDetailed Process Description:\n\nCurrently, the Robinson Lake Gas Plant has the capacity to process up to 90 MMscf/day of field natural gas.  The field gas is sweet and contains non-detectable amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S).  This field gas enters the facility and passes through an inlet separation process where entrained liquids are separated from the produced gas stream.  While most of the oil production occurs at the wellhead locations, any additional oil/condensate production at the plant inlet is routed to three 400 barrel atmospheric storage tanks which are loaded out by truck as needed.  \n\n\n\nThe inlet gas stream from the separator is routed to the inlet compression driven by electric compressors.  These units compress the inlet gas to both refrigeration plants at a pressure of approximately 500 psig.  The compressed gas is routed through a propane refrigeration system and NGL recovery skid with ethylene glycol (EG) injection, equipped with all electric compressor units, which further remove water and NGL from the stream.  The rich EG is routed to the d"

This gas stream from the still column consists primarily of water vapor and CO2, which is vented to atmosphere from the EG unit associated with the new refrigeration plant (Plant #2) and NGL train.  Furthermore, based on historical operating conditions at the existing refrigeration plant (Plant #1) and new permit conditions, Whiting has removed the condensers on the two existing EG units (EU-4 and EU-5) as the gas stream from the still column has negligible hydrocarbon emissions.  As such, the condensers do not provide any additional emissions control.  \n\n\n\nExtensive natural gas liquids (NGL) are produced from the NGL fractionation trains and are routed to a series of pressurized NGL storage tanks.  Currently, there are three (3) 90,000 gal. propane tanks, two (2) 90,000 gal. butane tanks, three(3) 90,000 gal. Y-grade tanks and three(3) 30,000 gal. Y-grade tanks.  The NGL (both C3 and C4) is removed daily from the tank by pressurized truck loadout.  Whiting also anticipates up to 65,000 gal/day of stabilized condensate (RVP 12 psia) associated with the fractionation process, which is comprised of C5+ liquids and stored in four(4) vertical storage tanks well removed from the NGL bullet tanks.  The recent expansion of the hot oil system included the installation of a 43.6 MMbtu/hr hot oil heater that is used to accommodate the increasing heat loads associated with greater throughput, NGL production, stabilized condensate production and liquids fractionation at the plant.  \n\n\n\nAs part of the facility modification in 2011, the cold separator temperature has been raised significantly at the plant, resulting in an increase in the amount of excess water in the residue gas.  As such, Whiting has installed a 60 MMscfd TEG dehydration unit added to the residue gas stream in order to meet the required pipeline specification of 2.2 l"

All flash tank vapors are captured and routed to the fuel gas header while a BTEX condenser is utilized to remove liquids from the overhead vapor stream off of the reboiler still vent.  Remaining non-condensable vapors off of the outlet from the BTEX condenser are vented to atmosphere while the condensed liquids are collected in a tank.  After passing through the TEG unit, the dry residue gas stream is compressed to approximately 1000 psi, depending on pipeline pressure, before leaving the plant via a sales pipeline.\n\n\n\nProgram Level:\n\nIt has been determined that this is a Program Level 3 facility.  Based on recent population growth in the area and plant expansion, there are some public receptors that are within the range of the worst-case release scenario.  In particular, there are several trailers and an apartment structure that are just south of the plant that could potentially fall within the worst-case overpressure endpoint. There are no environmental receptors within the range of the worst-case release scenario.  This facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation, 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies:\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies are provided in the facility's Process Safety Management Guidelines manual.  The plant's emergency response plan has been coordinated with the Mountrail County Local Emergency Planning Committee(LEPC) and agency personnel have toured the facility.  Whiting Oil and Gas Corpation takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at its facility by ensuring that employees are trained in the safe operation of the plant and evacuation procedures.  \n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nThe facility contains a fractionated NGL product storage and shipping process.

Propane is used as refrigerant in the refrigeration process.\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is that the 5 co-located 90,000 gallon NGL tanks on the south side of the facility are ruptured and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  While this scenario is higly unlikely, it is possible given the very close proximity of 2-90,000 gallon butane tanks, 3-90,000 gallon propane tanks and associated connected piping, that if one or more of these tanks were involved in an explosion, that a chain-reaction could breach all of the adjacent NGL tanks before any mitigation procedures could be employed.  The other Y-grade NGL tanks at Robinson Lake are well to the northeast of the butane/propane bullet tanks and would not likely be involved in a worst-case release scenario.  No active mitigation is considered.  Worst case meteorological conditions are assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate the endpoint distance for overpressure of 1.0 pound per square inch (PSI) for a flammable mixture vapor cloud explosion.   A distance of 1.0 miles to the overpressure endpoint was determined for a release of 2,025,864 pounds in ten minutes for the NGL process.  Recently, several trailers were located about 0.4-0.5 miles south of the facility and represent potential public receptors within this distance. It is estimated that up to 12 residents could occupy these trailers. There are no other environmental receptors within the estimated overpressure distance.\n\n\n\nAlternative-Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario is that one of the 90,000 gallon Butane tanks on the south side of the facility is ruptured and released over a ten (10) minute period, resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The butane is a refrigerated liquid stored under pressure. Worst case meteorological conditions are assumed and RMP*Comp was used to calculate "

A distance of 0.3 miles to the overpressure endpoint was determined for a release of 446,490 pounds of butane in ten minutes for this specific NGL process. This quantity of butane is the amount that could be in a completely full butane tank and associated piping.  Active mitigation of the scenario would include the lead operator ESD (emergency shut-down) the plant which would send the liquid control valve to storage to it's failed state (closed), thereby isolating any tank involved in an explosion from the rest of the process and continuted feed of NGL.\n\n\n\nAccident History:\n\nThis is a relatively new facility and has not experienced an incident that resulted in injuries or environmental damage as defined in the RMP rule in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nThe facility has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies.   The plan is designed to protect personnel on the site, to ensure their safe and orderly evacuation in event of an emergency, and to provide notification, appropriate information and protection for response personnel."
