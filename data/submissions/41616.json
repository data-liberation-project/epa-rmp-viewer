Chlorine gas is stored at the planrt site within a contained Chlorine Storage Room. A maximum of twenty-eight 1-ton  chlorine room.  Amaximum of twenty-eight 1-ton chlorine cylinders is stored onsite.  Four cylinders are kept on-line, and four cylinders are kept in standby mode. The Chlorine Building is equipped with an automatically operated ventilation system. Opening a door activates a limit switch in contact with the door to alter the operator in the control room that someone has entered the chlorine room. A video camera is located un the room to monitor access. Upon exiting the space, the operator closes the door and presses a button near the door. This button turns off the exhaust fan and closes the damper. The Chlorine building is also monitored with chlorine gas detectors. If chlorine gas is detected above 3ppm, a chlorine gas scrubber located adjacent to the building is automatically activated. The scrubber ventilates air from the building at a rate of 5,000 cfm through a packed tower where the chlorine gas is absorbed by a caustic solution. The scrubber performmance is rated for 99% chlorine gas removal. In addition a new automatic shutdown system has been installed on all online cylinders, if chlorine gas is detected at 1ppm all tans will shut down automatically. The OCA performed for the City consists of: a chemical release assessment using air dispersion modeling; identification of the area where impacts are above the specified toxic end point criteria; and estimating the potentially affected populations and environmental receptors. One (1) worst-case release scenario and two (2) alternative release scenarios were performed. Tools utilized for conducting the OCA consisted of the follwing. EPA has defined a worst-case release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from vessel or process line failure that results in the gre"
