      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at the Stationary Source \n\nLineage has a long-standing commitment to workers, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration system.  It is Lineage's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  \nThe Program 3 at Lineage-Hilltop, is a facility-run program with continuous support from Lineage - Compliance Department that includes; Process Safety Management (PSM) Compliance and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Compliance.   \n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nLineage - Hilltop is located at 3040 Hilltop Road, in Moss Landing, California, which is approximately 3 miles south of the city of Watsonville. The area immediately surrounding the facility is agricultural. \nThe regulated substance handled at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  \nThe facility's primary activities revolve around large-scale public storage of food products.  All the ammonia inventory is used as refrigerant.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Lineage-Hilltop, which also serve to manage process safety issues associated with the use of anhydrous ammonia.  Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.  The regulated substance is over 10,000 lbs. federal threshold for EPA RMP and OSHA PSM.   As a result, the anhydrous ammonia-covered process (ammonia refrigeration system) is subject to OSHA PSM and EPA Program 3.\n\nProgram 3 Prevention Program Elements include:\n\u0095\tProcess Safety Information\n\u0095\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u0095\tOperating"
