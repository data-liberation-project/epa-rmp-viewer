This includes a dedicated environmental, health and safety department that works together with plant operations to ensure that a program is in place such that safety and preparedness is maintained for all plant employees and the surrounding community. In addition, Lubrizol complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws pertaining to environmental, safety and health.\n\nAs part of the safety program, all new employees go through a safety orientation program. This includes but is not limited to the correct use of personal protection equipment, safe practices on the job and awareness and use of emergency equipment.\n\nA training program is in place to train all employees to reach and maintain proficiency in safe work practices and maintain the skills and knowledge necessary to perform their jobs. All contractors are also required to be a part of the same safety and training programs.\n\nMany layers of protection are developed and put in place on all processes to prevent accidental releases. Equipment is expertly designed according to strict engineering standards. Safety reviews are conducted on new and modified processes and equipment during design and before start-up. A maintenance and inspection program is conducted and documented to ensure facility soundness.\n\nLubrizol's ongoing process safety program includes a measurement of performance, audits and implementation of corrective actions. This continuous management of the system assures that safety is always the top priority.\n\nIf an emergency were to occur, we have a trained and certified emergency response organization staffed 24 hours a day to immediately react and mitigate the emerg"

In addition, we have six alternate release scenarios representing the toxins and one representing the flammables. All the toxic scenarios were modeled using the EPA accepted CAMEO/ALOHA air dispersion computer model. The flammable scenarios were conducted by using the EPA's RMP Comp modeling program.\n\nOur worst-case scenario representing the toxins is failure of the storage tank of 22,000 pounds of hydrogen sulfide resulting in direct release over a ten-minute period. Written operating procedures and high-level alarms prevent more than 22,000 pounds from being present in the storage tank. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nOur worst-case scenario representing the flammables is the simultaneous failure of three 29,000-gallon storage tanks of 2-methylpropene when filled to their greatest amount allowed (90%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. Written operating procedures and high-level alarms prevent more than a  90% level in any of the three tanks. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nBecause of all the layers of protection in place such as the safe design of the tanks, pressure and level detectors, and safe operating instructions it is highly unlikely that these worst-case scenario's would ever occur.\n\nOur alternate release scenario's are as follows:\n\nHydrogen sulfide: a gasket failure at a flange on a two-inch pipe. With active measures in place such as   excess flow valves, hydrogen sulfide sensor's surrounding the process piping and vessel, and the high odor detection of hydrogen sulfide  the release duration would most likely be limited to  10 minutes or less.

All of these mechanisms are  continuously being reviewed and revised to assure that our facility operates in the safest and most efficient manner.\n\nThe five-year accident history:\n\nThere was one incident at the facility in the past five years that meets the definition of the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) reporting requirements. There was a two-pound release of chlorine gas on 7/23/98. An employee inhaled some vapors and was treated at a local hospital. There were no offsite impacts involved with this release. \n\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nLubrizol maintains an emergency response policy at its stationary site located at 155 Freedom Rd., Painesville, Ohio 44077. There is an emergency response organization (ERO) in place twenty-four hours a day. This consists of an incident commander and trained emergency responders. There are also certified hazardous material technicians, EMT's and paramedics on staff. The emergency response policy is documented within Lubrizol Painesville's \"Emergency Response Plan\" manual. The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authorities and the local emergency planning committee (LEPC).

This system identifies the root cause of the problem and a responsible party to put immediate corrective actions in place to prevent the incident from occurring again. A system is in place to review the progress and check the effectiveness of the corrective actions.  \nFrom this there has been new training developed plant-wide that addresses a multitude of areas that will improve the overall environmental, health and safety of our facility and surrounding community.

If there are any concerns, projects are initiated to address the concerns as part of our continuous capital improvement process.\nSome recent projects completed related to RMP regulated processes include upgrades to fire suppressant systems, level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines and installation of additional emergency equipment.\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosophy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community."
