The policy combines advanced technology, standardized operating procedures, personnel training requirements, and a top- down management commitment to safe chlorine handling practices.  The facility emergency response policy involves utilization of , and coordination with, off-site responders to address potential chlorine related incidents.\n\n(b)The Bellvue WTP is located northwest of Fort Collins, Colorado near the mouth of the Cache la Poudre River Canyon.  The plant provides high-quality drinking water to the City of Greeley, Colorado.  An inventory of four one- ton chlorine containers is regularly maintained on-site in a dedicated chlorination building.  The plant operates 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  Resident operators address after-hours alarms and monitor overall facility security.\n\n(c)The plant performed the required off-site consequence analyses (\"OCA\") for the agency- defined \"worst- case\" and \"alternative\" release scenarios.  The plant utilized the OCA guidance for chlorine published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") in the Risk Management Program Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n    The worst- case scenario must assume the catastrophic release over ten minutes of the entire contents of a full one- ton container of chlorine, certain specified atmospheric conditions and the failure of all active mitigation systems.  As permitted by the guidance, the facility assumed that the chlorination building would provide a degree of passive mitigation by slowing the release of chlorine gas to the atmosphere.  Applying the guidance, a"

The plant utilized a scenario involving the rupture of  5/16 inch tubing releasing chlorine gas at a rate of 15 pounds per  minute.  Applying the guidance, and assuming a rural landscape with no active or passive  mitigation, the plant determined the alternative release scenario would have an off-site toxic endpoint of two-tenths of a mile (0.2 miles).\n\n(d)The Bellvue WTP Accidental Release Prevention Program is based on the following elements:\n\n     Advanced process and safety equipment;\n     A chlorine gas detector alarm in the chlorine building that triggers at concentrations greater than one part per million. (The alarm consists of audible horns located throughout the plant and a strobe light at the entrance to the chlorine building.  This alarm is also connected to a computerized auto-dialing system that alerts on- call personnel.);\n     Standardized operating procedures;\n     Training of operators and maintenance personnel in the chlorine process;\n     Preventive maintenance program for chlorine process equipment;\n     Periodic hazard review of chlorine process equipment and procedures;\n     Auditing and inspection program"

Additionally, the entire plant is scheduled to begin a comprehensive refurbishing in the year 2000.  This will include the construction of a new chlorination building with state-of-the-art safety equipment, including a chlorine scrubber that will be designed to safely contain and neutralize the contents of a full one-ton container."
