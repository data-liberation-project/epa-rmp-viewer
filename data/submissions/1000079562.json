This program continues the City of Charlotte's commitment to the protection of its employees and the surrounding community and the control of the potential for such a release.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vest WTP currently uses chlorine (delivered in one ton cylinders) as a disinfection agent to meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.  As a portion of the RMP/PSM program, The City of Charlotte has developed the following accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the use of chlorine as a disinfectant:\n\n\n\n\n\n1)  Protection of public health and our employees is the City of Charlotte's highest priority.\n\n2)  Preventing the release of extremely hazardous substances is a key element of that protection.\n\n3)  Every appropriate step will be taken to prevent these releases, including management commitment to:\n\n     A..  Make all important information readily available.\n\n     B.  Routinely define training to employees.\n\n     C.  Clearly define roles and responsibilites.\n\n4)  Fulfilling his or her roll in prevention of these releases is a condition of employment for every employee.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood of a potential release, the City of Charlotte has incorporated the following general accidental release prevention program and chlorine-specific prevention steps:\n\n\n\n1)  The City of Charlotte's plant staff shall conduct routine preventative maintenance of key process components.\n\n2)  The City of Charlotte's employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Lockout/Tagout procedures.\n\n3)  The City of Charlotte's employees shall conduct all work according to any applicable Hot Work Permits.\n\n4) The City of Charlotte maintains a routine Inspection and Compliance Audit schedule.\n\n5) The City of Charlo"

      "SummaryText": "tte has developed a program that requires all Contractors to prequalify\n\nfor any work conducted for the City of Charlotte. The Pre-Qualification process identifies\n\ncontractors that can perform site activities without compromising the safety or health of The City of Charlotte personnel.\n\n6) Frequent employee training on the operation and maintenance of all the chlorine facilities\n\n7) Detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all chlorine operations and maintenance have been\n\ndeveloped and shall be adhered to.\n\n8) Pipelines that contain chlorine or chlorine solution shall bear a yellow \"chlorine\" label.\n\n9) All work on chlorine-labeled or chlorine-containing equipment must follow the SOPs and will proceed only\n\nafter notification of the Plant Supervisor and the Inside operator.\n\n10) Only those persons trained in chlorine safety shall be present during any work that could produce a release\n\n\n\nThe City of Charlotte's emergency response program uses an external emergency response team and\n\nfocuses on keeping employees away from dangerous areas, while the mechanical equipment and contract\n\nemergency services control the chemical release. When an employee observes a release, he/she shall secure\n\nthe area if possible, immediately notify the inside plant operator, make sure the inside operator notifies one of\n\nthe emergency coordinators, and leave the area.\n\n\n\nThere has been no accidental releases of controlled substances within the last five years.\n\nThere are no planned changes to improve safety, however our program is under constant review for ways to improve safety and if any planned changes come out of said reviews it will be added to the RMP executive summary or they would be noted in the MOC (Management of Change) records."
