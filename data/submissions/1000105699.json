The facility processes and stores fresh and frozen seafood using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant in a closed-loop system.  Ammonia is the safest refrigerant available and has excellent warning properties; it is extremely pungent at levels far below dangerous concentrations.  A seafood facility has occupied this site since 1906 and operations were consolidated as Alaska General Seafoods in 1999. The facility has been upgraded and expanded over the years, most recently in 2013. The facility is staffed year-round and also employs a large seasonal workforce during the processing season, with the highest number of employees on site from June 15th until September 5th.  During that time, the facility operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program \r\nAlaska General Seafoods - Ketchikan implements a prevention program to comply with the requirements of the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119), which is designed to prevent accidental releases of certain chemicals held in quantities over given thresholds.  The PSM program addresses all required elements including employee participation, process safety information and system drawings, operating procedures, hot work permits, management of change, mechanical integrity, training, pre-startup review, compliance audits, process hazard analysis, contractor safety, incident investigation and emergency response.  The system has built in safety features including high level controls and indicators, pressure relief valves, automatic and manually controlled valves and shutoffs, check v"

      "SummaryText": "alves, multiple leak detectors and emergency shutdown devices.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nPer the requirements of 40 CFR 68.42, facilities must include a five-year accident history for all accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on-site or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  There has been no such incident at the facility in the past five years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response\r\nAlaska General Seafoods - Ketchikan facility maintains a written emergency response plan per 29 CFR 1910.120 to facilitate safe response to potentially uncontrolled ammonia releases.  The plan identifies personnel designated and trained to conduct the necessary duties during an emergency.  Responsibilities include notification of and communication with local responders and authorities, orderly evacuation of the facility and coordinating and conducting responses, as well as maintenance of emergency equipment and trained personnel. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nSafety at the facility is improved continuously through the process hazard analysis process, safety meetings, employee suggestions, accident, incident and near-miss investigations, and as the result of internal and external audits and inspections. Upgrades are planned on an ongoing basis as needed to keep the system in safe working order."
