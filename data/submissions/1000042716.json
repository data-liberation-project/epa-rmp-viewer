Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe at Boise are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  In the unlikely event of such a release, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Koochiching County Sheriff's Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nBoise owns and operates an integrated pulp and paper mill at this location.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility, Chlorine Dioxide.  The regulated substances at our facility are involved in several uses.  Chlorine Dioxide is used for pulp bleaching and biocide treatment of water in the paper machine and filter plant areas.\n\n\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine Dioxide at our facility is 29,550 lbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\n\n\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nBoise maintains a detailed record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur fac"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a HAZOP.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Boise  maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.  These procedures are certified annually.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nBoise has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees that are operating Chlorine Dioxide process are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these process.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nBoise carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper functions.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.

Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes for Chlorine Dioxide are conducted as a regular practice at Boise.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nBoise conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.  The previous two audits are kept on file.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nBoise promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Chlorine Dioxide.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nBoise truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Emergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nBoise carries a written emergency response plan, which includes dealing with the accidental releases of Chlorine Dioxide.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.
