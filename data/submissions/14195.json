According to EPA's  Look-up  Tables\nand  Equations the maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for  this\nWCS  is  0.44 mile. Some industrial sites and residences are within\nthis  distance.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested\nin accident prevention, such as training personnel and\nconsideration of safety in the design, installation, operation, and\nmaintenance of our processes.  This facility, commissioned in\nAugust 1988, was designed and constructed utilizing generally\naccepted industry codes and recommended practices such as ANSI -\nAmerican National Standard Institute, ASME - American Society of\nMechanical Engineers, TEMA - Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers\nAssociation, and API - American Petroleum Institute.  It is our\npolicy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.\nOur policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent\nforeseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a\nrelease does occur, plans have been developed to control and\ncontain such a release.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe  Willard CO2 Separation Plant is located in a rural  area  four\n(4)  miles  North of Denver City, Texas.  Denver City  has  a  1990\ncensus  population of approximately 5,000.  Denver City is  located\nin West Texas approximately 90 miles South of Lubbock, Texas and 90\nmiles  North  of Midland, Texas.  The plant processes a  wet  (H20)\ncarbon dioxide rich (83% CO2) gas stream to produce a dry CO2  rich\n(86%  CO2)  natural  gas  stream for use in tertiary  oil  recovery\nprojects  in  the  immediate  area.  Natural  gas  liquids  (NGLs),\nsulfur, and hydrocarbon condensate oil are also produced from  this\nprocess.   The  plant  has several regulated  flammables,  such  as\nmethane,  ethane, propane, butanes and pentanes.  The  Willard  CO2\nSeparation"

The compressors and the other rotating\nequipment   are  electrically  driven  except  for  the   emergency\nelectrical  generator and firewater pump, which are  diesel  engine\npowered.  The natural gas fired equipment include: boilers,  glycol\nre-boiler,  gas  heaters, plant flare and other combustion  sources\nwhich burn sweet natural gas purchased from outside sources.\n\nAfter  the first and second stages of compression, the entire  feed\ngas  stream  goes  through a triethylene glycol  (TEG)  dehydration\nsystem  to remove water from the gas stream.  Lean TEG absorbs  the\nwater  and  small amounts of hydrocarbon from the gas stream.   The\nrich  TEG  flows to a flash tank, where the hydrocarbon  gases  are\nreleased  and returned to the plant inlet for re-processing.   From\nthe  flash  tank,  the TEG is regenerated using a direct-fired  re-\nboiler.  The water vapor and hydrocarbon separated from the  glycol\nare  condensed.  The oil and water are subsequently separated  from\neach other.  The oil is sold and the water is used for injection in\na nearby tertiary oil recovery project.\n\nAfter  the  gas is dehydrated it enters the Ryan-Holmes process,  a\npatented lean oil absorption gas separation process, that separates\nthe  CO2, nitrogen, and methane from the H2S and NGLs.  The  system\nincludes  a  closed  loop  propane  refrigeration  system  for  the\ngeneration of liquid CO2 used as process reflux.

Lean  DEA  removes  hydrogen\nsulfide  (H2S) and the remaining CO2 from the NGLs.

The\nsweetened  NGLs  extracted  from the  DEA  process  are  stored  in\npressurized  tanks,  then pumped and sold  through  a  third  party\npipeline.\n\nIn  the  SRU, H2S is converted into elemental sulfur.  This  molten\nsulfur  is  stored in a vessel until it is shipped out in insulated\ntrailers and sold.
