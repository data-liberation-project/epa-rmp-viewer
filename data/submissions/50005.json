The Emergency Response Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of the Costco Warehouse's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nCostco maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\n\nCostco Warehouse has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, Laredo Fire Department.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Warehouse to evacuate the employees and to allow the fire department to respond to the emergency (potentially with the assistance of trained facility personnel).\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nCostco Warehouse began facility operations in November  2002.  The ammonia system at Costco Warehouse consists primarily of vessels, compressors, a condenser, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the Engine Room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\n\nThe Costco Warehouse facility provides cold storage space and a docking area for warehouse items.  Ammonia sensors are located in the Engine Room and Warehouse that alert facility personnel and activate the ventilation system in the Engine Room an"

The maximum intended inventory of ammonia is 14,000 pounds.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe Costco Warehouse ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP). \n\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and the warehouse.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\n\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.). \n\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief line.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a common header which relieves, via an emergrency refrigerant control box, to an outside water diffusion tank until the system pressure decreases sufficiently to reseat the valves.  This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.

The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Laredo Fire Department and the local fire houses.  In case of a major ammonia emergency, the facility will first call 9-1-1 to alert the local Police and Fire Departments.  Other responders will be called as needed, including the Department of Public Safety Emergency Management Services.  If a release exceeds the federal reporting quantity of 100 pounds for ammonia, the National Response Center and the Emergency Spill Report Sensor will be called.\n\nCostco Warehouse maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  The plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes due to renovation of the facility.\n\nCostco Warehouse will be responsible for evacuating and ensuring the safety of its employees and will coordinate emergency response efforts with the fire department on a periodic and ongoing basis.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted on October 25, 2002, and a revalidation of the PH"

The Costco Warehouse facility is planning to complete several items over the next year as their continued effort to provide a safe work environment for their employees.  These changes include the following items:\n\n1.  Continue to train all employees in PSM/RMP and safety programs.\n\n2.  Continue to have employee involvement in updating and refining PSM/RMP and the facility's safety programs.\n\n3.  Continue employee involvement through the Employee Participation program.\n\n4.
