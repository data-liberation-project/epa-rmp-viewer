Atkinson Fire Department.  \r\n\r\nOSI has coordinated their emergency action plan with the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Ft. Atkinson Fire Department.  This coordination effort includes providing each aforementioned agency with a copy of our emergency action plan, providing each with a site diagram and hazardous material information.\r\n\r\nAlthough OSI does not have an onsite hazardous materials response team, selected individuals have received HAZWOPER training through classroom instruction, on-the-job training, and drills.

OSI recently conducted an audit of their Process Safety Management Program / Risk Management Plan and has dutifully implemented the recommendations from that audit. Continuous improvement in safety is an important goal for OSI. In addition to the facility EAP, the plant is included in a community emergency response plan developed by the Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee. \r\n\r\nXI.\tManagement Program\r\nOSI has developed a management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management program elements.  This includes assigning a qualified person (or position) to have overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the risk management program elements.  If any portion of the program is delegated to others, the names or positions of those individuals are to be documented and the lines of authority defined through an organization chart or similar document.  Carl Dehner, Maintenance Manager, is responsible for overall implementation of the Risk Management Program, while Jeff Egler, Maintenance Supervisor has responsibilities related to the daily upkeep of the PSM / RMP and has been designated as an emergency contact."

      "SummaryText": "I.\tIntroduction\r\nA Risk Management Program has been implemented at the OSI Industries, LLC (OSI), Ft. Atkinson, WI facility, for the reduction of accidental releases of hazardous materials. This Program summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The Risk Management Plan (RMP) is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tOSI's policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tOSI's Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at OSI; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities. OSI is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and to the environment. It is OSI policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses potentially catastrophic chemical releases that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes the Facility's Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures, which are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and v"

Atkinson, Wisconsin. The facility processes ground beef specialties. The NAICS code for the processes at the facility is 311991.  Many areas of the plant are refrigerated to maintain temperature in the production and storage areas.\r\n\r\nOSI Ft. Atkinson is a food processing facility that runs a continuous operation. OSI utilizes a regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, for refrigeration. Two closed loop refrigeration systems are required to freeze and cool the raw material and product and maintain the facility's temperature. OSI has a total of 69,000 pounds of Anhydrous Ammonia onsite. System 1 contains 37,000 pounds and System 2 contains 32,000 pounds. \r\n\r\nAn aerial photo identifying the site location is included as Appendix A.\r\n\r\nIV.\tHazard Assessment - Worst Case Scenarios (WCS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the worst-case scenario.  Appendix C consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the worst case release scenario. \r\n\r\nV.\tHazard Assessment - Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS)\r\nAppendix B consists of the RMP*Submit Printout and contains additional information on the alternative release scenario.  Appendix D consists of the offsite consequence analysis data and maps for the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nVI.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\nA prevention program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and the EPA Risk Management Program.   However, as discussed throughout this document OSI is continuously improving this program. \r\n\r\nThis prevention program covers those processes that handle ammonia above the threshold quantity for both PSM and RMP rules.

In addition, the employee participation program will ensure employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under PSM/RMP.  \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Safety Information - OSI maintains a site-specific PSI program that ensures information pertaining to the hazards, technology, and equipment of the process are properly developed and maintained. \r\n\u00bf\tProcess Hazard Analysis - OSI has developed a site-specific PHA program that ensures a PHA is conducted initially, at a minimum of every five (5) years, and whenever a change is significant enough to require a change in PSI.  In addition, this program ensures PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and ensures findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. OSI completed a thorough PHA revalidation study for the ammonia refrigeration systems on June 12, 2015.\r\n\u00bf\tOperating Procedures - OSI has updated a site-specific procedure that ensures operating procedures provide clear instruction for different phases of process operations and ensures they are properly maintained.    \r\n\u00bf\tTraining - OSI has developed a site-specific training procedure that ensures employees operating the ammonia process have the knowledge to safely operate the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the causes of process problems.\r\n\u00bf\tManagement of Change - OSI has devel"
