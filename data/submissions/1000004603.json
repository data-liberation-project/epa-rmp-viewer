Joslin, Illinois facility management to implement the requirements of this Risk Management Program (RMP) in accordance with the USEPA regulations under 40 CFR Part 68 and with the corresponding regulations under OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The objective is to minimize the risk of a release of a hazardous material and if a release occurs, to minimize the potential impact to Tyson employees, the public and the environment.  This objective will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures, providing appropriate training to all employees, and coordinating response activities, as necessary, with the local emergency response providers. This plan covers all Tyson owned activities at this facility.\nTyson's management is committed to providing the resources necessary to implement this policy.\nFacility Description\nTyson operates a cattle slaughter and processing facility and a hides tannery at this location.  Cattle are trucked to the facility, slaughtered and fabricated.  Tyson operates rendering systems to produce gel bone, dried blood, low protein beef byproducts, tallow, and other rendered products. Trans-Continental Cold Storage (TCCS) operates a freezer at this location. Support operations include a wastewater treatment system, truck repair facilities, an analytical laboratory, and administrative offices.\n\n2)  Three chemicals are utilized at the facility in sufficient quantities to be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.  These chemicals are chlorine and ammonia and methane. Chlorine is used to treat wastewater, methane is captured under the anaerobic lagoon covers and used in a boiler or flared to the atmosphere. The ammonia is used as a refrigerant at both Tyson and TCCS.\n\n3)  General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Joslin, Illinois facil"

These regulations include:\n* 40 CFR Part 68, Accidental Release Prevention\n* 40 CFR Part 112, Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure\n* 40 CFR Part 264, Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan\n* 29 CFR Part 119, Process Safety Management\n* 40 CFR Part 302, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)\nThe key concepts in Tyson's release prevention program are employee participation, appropriate design and maintenance of equipment, and appropriate training of all employees.  Tyson has developed and documented these elements in their process safety management plan (PSM).  The PSM plan is incorporated with this document by reference.\nEmployee participation in the release prevention program is encouraged and supported by Tyson management.  Key personnel are responsible for conducting and implementing the findings from the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for the ammonia and chlorine systems.  Tyson employees are also members of the facility emergency response team.\nTyson policy is to construct all new equipment, systems, and facilities to ensure the appropriate safety and release prevention systems are included from the beginning of each project. Tyson maintains a computerized program of maintenance activities to ensure that key systems are maintained appropriately to minimize the risk of a release.\nTyson is committed to providing appropriate training to all employees regarding safety procedures. Each new employee is provided comprehensive safety training during their initial orientation for the facility. In addition, Tyson conducts regularly scheduled safety training for all employees each year. Additional training is provided to maintenance personnel for the sys"

Members of Tyson's emergency response team receive annual training to ensure that response actions are promptly and safely completed.\n\n4)  Five Year Accident History\nTyson has not had a release of ammonia or chlorine from the Joslin, Illinois, facility that has affected the public or the environment.\n\n5)  Emergency Response Program\nTyson has personnel trained in emergency response at the facility 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  These personnel receive annual training on emergency procedures and response techniques.\nTyson employees will attempt to extinguish small fires with fire extinguishers if they have been properly trained \nTyson has met with the local fire department to establish coordination and communication procedures.\nEmergency Contact information within the RMP contains phone numbers for the following purposes and use by EPA:\n\nEmergency Contact phone: the emergency contact number provided for EPAA?s use is a direct line to the office of the Emergency Contact person for TysonA?s Joslin facility during normal business hours.  If there is an immediate need and the Emergency Contact is not available at this number, EPA should then make use of the 24-hour phone provided and request to speak with him. \n24-hour phone: outside of normal business hours, EPA is to call the 24-hour number provided.  The 24-hour phone number provided here is to the facilityA?s 24-hour manned guard station, within the guard station is a phone-list.  In the event of an emergency the security guard is trained to make calls and inform the proper facility management of the emergency at hand.  The facility will initiate training with their security personnel that from this point forward that phone will now be for two-way use.
