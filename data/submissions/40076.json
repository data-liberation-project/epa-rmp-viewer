THE MAXIMUM QUANTITY RELEASED WOULD BE \n140, 000 POUNDS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VOLUME OF THE (LARGEST STORAGE TANK) AS LIMITED BY DESIGN STANDARDS.\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS 2.7 MILES.\nTHE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO BASED ON THE MOST LIKELY POTENTIAL INCIDENT IS A RELEASE FROM A BREAK IN A TRANSFER HOSE.  EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES, WHICH INCLUDE THE CLOSING OF TANK VALVES, WAS THE ONLY ACTIVE MITIGATION CONSIDERED TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT RELEASED.\nTHE DISTANCE TO THE ENDPOINT OF .14 MG/L FOR THE ALTERNATIVE SCENATIO IS .3 MILES.
