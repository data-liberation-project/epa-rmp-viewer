      "SummaryText": "(a) Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe Occidental Permian Ltd. Wasson CO2 Recovery Plant (WCRP) is committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes (especially regarding the use of hazardous substances) in a safe and responsible manner.  We use a combinaiton of accidental release prevention safeguards and programs and emergency response programs to address the safety of our employees and the public, and the protection of the environment.  Our policy is to integrate process controls and administrative procedures that are designed to prevent the release of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, WCRP personnel are trained through an emergency action plan to control and contain the release.  The document provides a brief overview of the risk management activities we have designed and implemented.\r\n\r\n(b) Description of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \r\n\r\nWCRP is designed to process produced gas and recycle CO2 back to our field injection operations.  During our process, we recover natural gas liquids (NGL) and strip  hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the gas stream.  We utilize propane as a cooling agent for the process stream and we treat our cooling water with MISC/other sodium Hypochlotite 12.5% bleach.  Our evaluation of the regulated substances involved in the WCRP process resulted in our classifying this as a Program Level 1 process with only our propane inventory exceeding threshold quanities of the listed regulated substances.\r\n\r\n(c) General Accidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nWCRP is a Program Level 1 and is not required to have a specific prevention program.  However, we do have an active PSM program, which incorporates accidental release prevention.  \r\n\r\n(d) Five-year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn our review of the WCRP incident records for the past five years, we have had one fire listed in section 6  resulting in 0 deaths, 0 injuries, evacuation of the plant,  property damage of ar"

Our plan considers all federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  The plan is designed to respond to a release of a regulated substance and provides first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, and notification of local emergency response agencies.  We have coordinated our emergency response activities with the Denver City, Texas emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\n1.  We will continue to develop and utilize a root cause failure methodology in analyzing any WCRP incidents.\r\n2.  We will continue to develop and share management practices involving operations and maintenance activities between Oxy plants.\r\n3.  We will review our active process safety management program from time to time for appropriate improvements to the program.\r\n4. We have developed a new operator training program with KBC to insure better training of the plant operators this ncludes writing new training manuals and one one one training.\r\n5. We have replaced the liquid chlorine with bleach. Less danger to the public.\r\nCertification\r\n\r\nBased on the criteria in 40 CFR 68.10, the distance to the specific endpoint for the worst case accidental release scenario for the propane inventory is less than the distance to the nearest public receptor:\r\nWithin the past 5 years the process (es) has (have) had no accidental release that caused offside impacts provided in the RMP rule (40 GFR 68.10(b)(1).  No additional measures and necessary to prevent offsite impact from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion, or a release of regulated substance from the process (es), entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to the public emergenc"
