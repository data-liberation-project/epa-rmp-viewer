In response to the County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health, Hazardous Materials Management Division, this Risk Management Program document (RMP) has been developed for the South Bay Power Plant (SBPP) located in Chula Vista, California.  This document has been prepared to satisfy the following regulations: \n-California Office of Emergency Services, California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program, October 10, 2002.\n-Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions.\n\n2. The purpose of this document is to facilitate the protection of public health, the environment, and facility employees by providing to the public and regulatory agencies information on regulated substances, a 5-year history of no accidents, potential offsite consequences of a hypothetical worst-case release, and coordination with local emergency response agencies.\n\n3. The regulated substance of concern and focus of this document is aqueous ammonia (29.4\u00a0percent by weight).  The facility uses aqueous ammonia for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of boiler flue gas nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions to elemental nitrogen and\u00a0water and is operated by Duke Energy South Bay LLC. \n\n4. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Data Elements are contained in Chapter 2.0 of this RMP.
