This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. The DGOC is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances:\n\nDGOC operates the Kermit Compressor Station located in Mingo County, West Virginia. This facility receives dehydrated feed gas where it is cooled by heat exchange with propane refrigerant.  Condensate, or heavier ends in the gas, are separated from the inlet stream.  It is then stabilized, treated and stored in a 30,000 gal storage tank and ultimately loaded into tank trucks for sales. The resultant gas is compressed and sent via pipeline to other end users. The Kermit Compressor Station does not use or store any regulated toxic substances above the EPA set threshold levels. This facility is classified as a Program Level 3 facility.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe Kermit Compressor Station has not had any accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Kermit Compressor Station. Because plant processes are subject to EPA's RMP regulations and to OSHA's PSM standards, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation:\n\nDGOC and the Kermit Compressor Station actively encourage all levels of employees and contract employees to participate in creating a safe work environment. This participation begins with well-established mechanisms of communication with all "

This information addresses chemical properties, inventories, and associated hazards, as well as design basis/configuration information for key process parameters. Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in the Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). This information is supplemented, when required, by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals. In addition, the plant has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters and ensures limit maintenance by using highly trained personnel, process controls, and monitoring and protective instrument systems. The plant also maintains documentation that provides information about the design and construction of process equipment. Equipment information includes construction materials, design pressure, and temperature and electrical ratings. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA):\n\nThe Kermit Compressor Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. \n\nThe Kermit Compressor Station primarily uses the What-If and HAZOP techniques to perform these evaluations.

The plant also provides proof of communication with operating, maintenance, and other employees whose work assignments are in the process and who may be affected by the recommendations.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years by the PHA team.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nThe Kermit Compressor Station maintains written Operating Procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as:\n\n(1)    Initial startup.\n\n(2)    Normal operations.\n\n(3)    Temporary operations.\n\n(4)    Emergency shutdown.\n\n(5)    Emergency operations.\n\n(6)    Normal shutdown.\n\n(7)    Startup following a turnaround or after an emergency shutdown. \n\nThese procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent training basis for new operators.
