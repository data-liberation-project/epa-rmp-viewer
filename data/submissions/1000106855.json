The training program must include either hands-on or classroom instruction and appropriate competency testing. Training covers, at a minimum, the connecting and disconnecting of cylinders, including visual inspections and the use of tools, and operation of cylinder handling equipment. All operations personnel responsible for the PLANT must have refresher-training at least annually.\n\nThe training program will include:\n?\tRisk Management Program\n?\tCl2 and/or SO2 Equipment and Process Safety\n?\tCl2 and/or SO2 Operating Procedures\n?\tCl2 and/or SO2 Maintenance Procedures\n?\tEmergency Response Program\n?\tGeneral Safety \n\nMechanical Integrity Program\nPreventative maintenance, inspection and testing of equipment are critical to safe operations, including crane and hoist system and scales. Preventative maintenance includes written procedures and schedules of maintenance, safety training of equipment operators and inspection of equipment per manufactures recommendations.  \n\n2.0\tSTATIONARY SOURCE\n\nThe plant is located in City of Beeville, TX and utilizes chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide. Chlorine is used for disinfection and sulfur dioxide neutralizes the chlorine before discharge.

The purpose of the ERP is to ensure that proper preparation, response, recovery, and consequence mitigation procedures are in place for accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide resulting from natural disaster, human error, equipment failure, or sabotage.  The goals of this program include the following:\n?\tProtect the public\u0092s health and the environment.\n?\tProtect the health of facility staff and contract employees.\n?\tProtect the health of local emergency response agency personnel.\n?\tCoordinate emergency response actions between the local emergency response agencies and facility staff.\n?\tProvide emergency response procedures to be followed by facility personnel during emergency situations.\n\nThere are no facilities employees designated or qualified to respond to an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance; therefore, the plant would be considered a non-responding facility by EPA standards. An incidental release which does not cause a potential safety or health hazard or that can be neutralized or controlled at the time of release by an on-site operator would not be considered an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. An Emergency Response Plan is in place at the facility to address incidental releases. \n\nIn the event of an accidental release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide. Additionally, a fla"

An understanding of the characteristics of chlorine and sulfur dioxide are essential to ensuring safe handling of these toxic substances.  Other pertinent safety information for chlorine and sulfur dioxide can be found in the plan. \n\nSpecifications for the chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide system components include the crane system.

The following factors were used in \u00b7the calculation of the toxic endpoint for this facility: Wind speed 1.5 m/s; Atmospheric Stability Class F; Temperature 25\u00b0; Humidity 50%; Urban Surface Roughness; Height of release 0-feet (ground level). For wastewater treatment plants, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are always assumed to be dense gases which travel close to the ground surface. An urban surface roughness was chosen because there are many obstacles in the path of potential release, including trees and structures.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the plant was developed using the EPA\u0092s screening tool RMP*COMP, and the distance to a toxic endpoint for chlorine in an urban area is 1.3 miles at"

The worst-case  scenario assumes that the entire quantity  of a single vessel would be released over a period of 10 minutes. For a 2,000-pound vessel, this calculates to a release rate of 200-lb/min. Other factors are taken into consideration in the determination of a toxic endpoint, including the terrain of the surrounding area (rural or urban), typical weather conditions and chemical density. The following factors were used in \u00b7the calculation of the toxic endpoint for this facility: Wind speed 1.5 m/s; Atmospheric Stability Class F; Temperature 25\u00b0; Humidity 50%; Urban Surface Roughness; Height of release 0-feet (ground level). For wastewater treatment plants, chlorine and sulfur dioxide are always assumed to be dense gases which travel close to the ground surface. An urban surface roughness was chosen because there are many obstacles in the path of potential release, including trees and structures.\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the plant was developed using the EPA approved RMP*COMP and the distance to a toxic endpoint for sulfur dioxide in an urban area is  1.3  miles at a release rate of 200-lb/min. A map showing the toxic endpoint radius around the plant is included in the plan.\n\n6.0\tOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS \u0096 ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO\n\nAlternative release scenarios have been developed for the plant. According to EPA requirements, an alternative scenario must be developed for each toxic substance held above the threshold quantity for a facility with multiple toxic substances on-site.\n\nThe EPA guidelines require evaluation of potential various scenarios that may be more realistic in occurring at the plant as an alternative scenario.  The below scenarios were co"

There have not been any offsite release incidents at the which could be referenced as an alternative scenario. Therefore, default conditions as suggested by the EPA Risk Management Plan guidelines were used to determine the alternative release scenarios for chlorine and sulfur dioxide. The EPA default weather conditions for the alternative release scenarios differ slightly from those used in the worst-case scenario analysis. The alternative scenario uses an atmospheric stability class D and a wind speed of 3 m/s.\n\nAlternative case scenario and off-site consequences analysis are included in the plan.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Chlorine\nFor the plant alternative chlorine release scenario, it is assumed that a release from \u00bc inch hole in liquid phase of the tank caused by mishandling storage vessel.

      "SummaryText": "ban area, it is determined a chlorine release rate of 160 lbs./min. for 12.5 minutes releasing the full contents of the tank.  The toxic endpoint is determined to be 0.2 mile.\n\nAll offsite receptors will be identified on the map as related to the alternative case scenario.  The offsite consequences analysis is included in the plan.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario - Sulfur Dioxide\nFor the plant alternative sulfur dioxide release scenario, it is assumed that a release from \u00bc inch hole in liquid phase of the tank caused by mishandling storage vessel.  Using US EPA Risk Management Guidance for Chemical Distributors and default conditions for an urban area, it is determined a chlorine release rate of 160 lbs./min. for 12.5 minutes releasing the full contents of the tank.  The toxic endpoint is determined to be 0.2 mile and is shown on the map included in the plan. \n\nAs discussed in the Offsite Consequence Analysis for the worst-case scenario, there are no active mitigation systems at this facility, which could limit the effects of an accidental chemical release, additionally the offsite receptors will be identified and mapped.  \n\nAll offsite receptors will be identified on the map as related to the alternative case scenario.  The offsite consequences analysis is included in the plan.  \n\n7.0\tFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAs of the publication date of this Risk Management Program there was no accidental release.  A statement of assurance from the Inframark RMP Manager regarding accidental releases at the Plant during the past five years is included in the plan.\n\nIf an accidental release happened there will be an incident investigation and will be completed and prepared for each accidental release that resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted, in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The incident investigation report must be retained for a period of five years following the incident. A catastrophic release is classified as having caused at least one of the fo"
