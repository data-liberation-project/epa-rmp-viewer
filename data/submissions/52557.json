Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) also stores and uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  DWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  DWP operates the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station (USCCS), which is a chlorination facility that stores and uses anhydrous chlorine for disinfection purposes.  A Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station was prepared and submitted to the United States Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and to the local Administering Agency (AA), city of Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), in June 2004, which was updated in November 2007. Subsequent to the November 2007 update of the RMP, the LADWP completed the chlorination station improvement project, which was in progress since 2004.  As part of this improvement project, the bulk chlorine storage tank was taken out of service, and the chlorination station started storing chlorine in one-ton containers.  A 4,700-lb capacity, dry media chlorine scrubber was also been installed at the Chlorination station. The above changes have further enhanced the safety of the chlorination station and will further mitigate offsite consequences of an accidental chlorine release. The chlorination station with ton containers and the scrubber system became operational in March 2008. This document is an update of the November 2007 RMP for the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station. \n\nAs mentioned above, the DWP Upper Stone Canyon Chlorinati"

The emergency response plan has been coordinated with local response agencies (City of Los Angeles Fire Department).  DWP employees respond to chlorine emergencies at the facility.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station is located at 1900 North Stone Canyon Road in Los Angeles, California.  There are multiple chlorine feed points on the reservoir complex property to disinfect water in Upper and Lower Stone Canyon Reservoirs, the Upper Stone Canyon bypass pipelines #1 and #2, and the membrane filtration plant.  The treated waters are piped into the distribution network, which serves parts of west Los Angeles with potable water.  The station building consists of a chlorine storage room, chlorine equipment room, an electrical equipment room, several chemical storage rooms, and a 4,700-lb capacity dry media scrubber room.  The facility stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  The Upper Stone Canyon facility stores a maximum of 22 one-ton chlorine containers.  Ten of these containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine liquid or gas.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  However, the facility is normally unmanned and water treatment operators visit the facility daily and respond to any trouble alarms, which may occur.  Thus, the DWP Upper Stone Canyon facility is not subject to federal or California OSHA PSM regulations.\n\nThe design incorporates two banks of 4 one ton-containers each, which normally feed liquid chlorine to evaporators.

      "SummaryText": "s an automatic switchover system that determines which liquid chlorine header feeds the evaporators.  This system consists of a control panel, two motorized ball valves, and a pressure switch on the liquid header before the evaporators.  When the pressure in the liquid chlorine supply line drops to 20 psi, the switchover system opens the valve isolating the standby bank of ton containers to allow liquid chlorine to flow.  At the same time, it closes the ball valve on the now empty bank of ton containers.\n\nThe system is also configured with gas headers for each of the two banks of 4 one ton-containers.  This is essentially a complete gas feed system with automatic switchover capability.  It can be used during periods of low chlorine demand, or if the liquid system is out of service for repairs.  It is being provided because of the uncertainty of operations at this site in the future.\n\nSince the normal operation is by withdrawing liquid chlorine, and the evaporators are equipped with motorized vacuum regulating valves downstream, it is possible for the gas supply to the chlorinators to be automatically shut off at the vacuum-regulating valve.  These valves can close upon a low temperature condition in the evaporator or at the valve, or upon power failure.  For this reason, in order to assure no interruptions of chlorine feed, a third bank of two one-ton containers is provided.  These two one-ton containers connect to a gas header which leads to three automatic switchover type vacuum regulating valves in parallel acting as an automatic backup gas supply.  The vacuum regulating valves have a capacity of 3,000 ppd each, for a total feed capacity of 9,000 ppd.  The valves open automatically based on a high vacuum condition that pulls the valve out of its detent position.  Since this is a mechanical setting on each separate valve, and the settings are not exactly the same, it is likely that not all of the valves will open at once.  One would open, followed by a second and "

Therefore, when it comes on line it must be considered an emergency supply only.  A quick response from an operator is needed to come to the station and either get the liquid system back on line, or else start shedding chlorine feed (such as shore feeds) to a rate that can be sustained from two gas containers.  Other options include placing one or both of the primary banks of four one-ton containers each on their gas header systems.  The idea is that this emergency backup is intended for only an hour or so of feed before intervention.\n\nA dry media type chlorine gas scrubber system is installed at the station.  The unit is actuated by chlorine detectors at a chlorine concentration of 3 ppm.  The scrubber can neutralize up to 4,700 lbs of chlorine in case of a chlorine leak.  The scrubber draws suction from the chlorine ton container and chlorinator rooms through a duct.  The station is equipped with an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in addition to a backup power generator.  Therefore, in case of the failure of regular power, the scrubber will be functional.\n\nAll of the one-ton containers connected to the process are equipped with Halogen Systems valve actuators which shut the ton container valves when desired.  The current plan calls for closing all eight ton-containers (two banks of four each) that are connected to either the liquid or gas headers when any of the chlorine gas sensors in the chlorine tank or chlorinator rooms detect gas exceeding 3 ppm.  The scrubber system starts simultaneously.\n\nThe emergency backup gas supply (two one-ton containers) is equipped with Halogen Systems valve actuators, but they do not close automatically upon sensing a chlorine leak.  They remain open until an operator on site presses one of the red mushroom switches to close all of the valves (total of 10).  These t"

      "SummaryText": "wo one-ton containers normally remain in service during a chlorine leak (or false alarm) to prevent loss of disinfection to the distribution system (unless shut by the above described action).  The total capacity of these containers would limit the total release to no more than two tons (if the leak happens to be in this system), which the scrubber system is designed to handle.  Responding operators would determine if these two tons should be isolated, and they take the appropriate action.\n\nThe chlorinators supply gaseous chlorine to each of the Upper, the two bypass lines, the Lower, and the membrane filtration plant injection systems.  Chlorine gas is withdrawn from the chlorinators under vacuum to the injectors.  In the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a concentrated solution.  The chlorine solution discharged from the injector is diffused into the pipelines or the reservoir through multiple diffuser nozzles.  The Stone Canyon Complex injection system has eighteen injectors spread out among seven vaults, each located at a various location throughout the complex.\n\nSeven chlorine leak detectors are provided in the station to detect chlorine leaks.  The detectors draw samples from the chlorine container and chlorinator rooms, as well as from the scrubber inlet and outlet ducts.  The detectors signal an alarm by activating a flashing red light over the entry door to the building, as well as an audible alarm within the container and chlorination rooms, and activating an alarm at the Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar.  Also, the chlorine injector vaults are equipped with chlorine leak sensors.\n\nProcess control is by a programmable controller, which determines the feed rate based on the water flow rate and the chlorine residual.  There are flow meters transmitting flow signals to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor the treated water residuals.\n\nIn the event power is lost at the chlori"

Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; and safe upper and lower pressures for the chlorination facility are on file at the facility.  DWP also has procedures in place that are triggered to update safety information if there is a major change that makes existing information inaccurate.\n\nHazard Review \n\nA hazard review of the Upper Stone Canyon Chlorination Station was performed in March 2002 after the system design was completed.  In addition, a review of the March 2002 hazard review was performed on August 1, 2008.  This review served to verify that the hazard review is consistent with the current process, which became fully operational in July 2008 after extensive construction delays. It will be updated again within a five-year period or prior to a major change in the process.  Based on the March 2002 hazard review, 30 recommended actions were identified to improve the safety of the chlorine system.  These recommendations were evaluated and implemented. Based on the August 2008 hazard review, six additional recommendations were made. These recommendations are under evaluation and it is expected that they will be   implemented by December 2008. \n\nSeismic design of the chlorination station building was based on the 1999 version of the City of Los Angeles Building Code, which incorporates the 1997 Uniform Building Code.  Also considered were the site-specific response spectra for the project.  A memo dated November 13, 2006 from Michael Truong describes how the design complies with the January, 2004 CalARP seismic guidance document.  The seismic design criteria related to the equipment installation was included in the construction specifications.
