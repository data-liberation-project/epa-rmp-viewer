Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant's Executive Summary of our Risk Management Plan.  It is the highest priority of the City of Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant to ensure that the quality of the St. Mary's River, our City's #1 natural resource, is not harmed in any fashion by the discharge from the plant or by its operational techniques.  The Wastewater Treatment Plant depends on the addition of chlorine to lower the final effluent bacterial count to an acceptable level prior to its entry into the St. Mary's River.\n\nThe citizens of Sault Ste. Marie depend on the St. Mary's River for their livelihoods and their recreation, so it is a goal of the Wastewater Treatment Plant to protect our neighbors from any accidental release of chlorine that is necessary to protect the river's high water quality.\n\nThis Executive Summary is submitted in eight segments.  It was created to both satisfy the Section 112r requirements and to assure our citizens of the great care taken in their protection from a release of chlorine that is beneficial to the disinfection of their waste water.\n\nThis Executive Summary was written by the management of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  It summarizes the overall safety programs that all Wastewater Treatment Plant staff created, maintain, update, and train for.  In no way is it intended to provide all the safety measures and programs at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  It is an overview to provide our customers with the chlorine information and to satisfy the risk management plan requirements.\n\nThe staff of the Wastewater Treatment Plant live in the City of Sault Ste. Marie.  The citizens of Sault Ste. Marie are our family, friends, and neighbors.  Their protection from an accidental release of chlorine has been, is, and shall remain to be of the utmost importance to us.\n\n1.  The Wastewater Treat"

The City's boundaries are the St. Mary's River to the East, North, and West.  3 Mile Road is its Southern border.\n\nThe citizens of Sault Ste. Marie have been served by as municipally treated wastewater facility since 1960.  Prior to this, the wastewater flowed directly to the St. Mary's River.  The original plant had primary treatment only, which provided only disinfection with chlorine and settling of solids material.  1-Ton containers of chlorine were utilized since the beginning of the City's wastewater treatment operations.\n \nIn 1985, the City invested millions of dollars to upgrade the existing wastewater treatment plant to provide complete treatment to our sewage.  The current facility involves the following treatment methods: Pre-aeration, bar screening, aerated grit-removal, primary sedimentation, secondary treatment with biological contactors, secondary sedimentation, chlorination, and de-chlorination.\n\nThe City of Sault Ste. Marie continues to use gaseous chlorine in 1-ton containers to disinfect the final effluent.  The City of Sault Ste. Marie has its use and extremely aware of the inherent dangers of its presence.\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is located at 1171 E. Portage Ave.  The plant is situated on a large tract of land adjacent to the St. Mary's River.  Its final effluent discharge line is a 30\" diameter pipe running out nearly 700 feet into the river.  Approximately 85 miles of sanitary sewers empty into our Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe original chlorine equipment was replaced in 2002 with a new, more modern, and safer system built by Regal Chlorinators.  The new system utilizes vacuum instead of ton cylinder pressure to feed chlorine.  Vacuum systems are inherently safer, as they will shut down in the event of a system leak.  Vacuum systems actually prevent venting of chlorine leaks by drawing in air to the opening instead"

The investment in the new vacuum feed system demonstrates the City of Sault Ste. Marie's commitment to utilizing the safest techniques and equipment available to feed chlorine.\n\nOur chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers.  The active 1-ton containers are stored in the Chlorine Room.  The non-active ton containers are stored adjacent to the Chlorine Room on a rail mounted holding system designed specifically for 1-ton containers.  The Chlorine Room is kept locked at all times.  Only authorized Wastewater Treatment Plant employees have access to the Chlorine Room.\n\nThe Chlorine Room has a sensitive alarm system that activates in the event of the most minute chlorine leak.  This alarm system was installed in 2016.  The maximum inventory capability is eight ton containers, although normal inventory levels are typically less than half that amount.\n\nOur chlorination flow pattern begins at our ton containers.  The vacuum regulator/check unit pulls chlorine gas (not liquid) to the chlorinator.  The chlorinator meters, controls, and injects the chlorine gas into a water line forming a chlorine solution.  The chlorine solution is piped to a contact tank where the disinfection process occurs.\n\n2.  Regulated Substances\n\nOur chlorine supply is the only substance that falls under Section 112r regulations.  Our chlorine is also regulated under MiOSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Part 91.\n \nChlorine is considered a toxic substance and has a characteristic, penetrating, and irritating odor.  The gas is greenish-yellow in color and the liquid is clear amber in color.  Gaseous chlorine is heavier than air and will sink to lower levels in a release.  It is non-flammable and alone it is stable, but it is a strong oxidizer and will and can react with a variety of hydrocarbons and metals.\n\nChlorine gas is primarily a respiratory irritant.

At concentrations near the threshold of smell (well below 1 part per million for most people) chlorine gas will, after several hours of exposure, cause mild irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract.  In extreme cases of chlorine inhalation, difficulty in breathing can progress to the point of death through suffocation.\n\nLiquid chlorine in contact with eyes or skin will cause local irritation and/or burns.\n\n3.  The Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Policies at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\n\nThe Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant takes a many-faceted approach to the safe handling of our chlorine and chlorination equipment.  We follow MiOSHA's Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, Part 91, rule to assist us in our use of chlorine.\n\nIt is the goal of the Wastewater Treatment Plant management and the City of Sault Ste. Marie to have a well trained workforce who can safely, correctly, and quickly respond to any situation by relying on their previous training and common sense to overcome any hazardous situation that may confront them.  Training is the key to this goal, so all employees receive documented training on all our operating procedures.  No employee can work a shift alone until they become fully trained.\n\nOur operating procedures are annually reviewed by the staff to make sure they reflect any changes made to the operations or equipment.  Our operating procedures are also checked to see if they could be made safer or more efficient.\n\nWe have an extensive maintenance program at the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  All chlorination equipment maintenance requirements are documented and scheduled.  Procedures, in accordance with the equipment manufacturer, were written for all maintenance activities, and qualified personnel only work on our chlorination equipment.

We used the What If/Checklist method.  We answered the scenarios as a group and now include them in our operating procedures and our contingency plan.\n\nIn short, Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant employees are trained in Process Safety Management, Process Hazard Analysis, operating procedures, maintenance procedures, standard safety practices, and safe work practices on a continuing basis to guard against the possibility of a chlorine release. \n \n4.  Worst Case Scenario\n\nOur worst case scenario for chlorine release is the complete release of a full ton container in 18 minutes, which represents a release rate of 110 lbs per minute.\n\nThe model used for our worst case is from the EPA's RMPComp program.  The conditions in the worst case scenario are a class F atmospheric stability, 50% relative humidity at 25 degrees C. with a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second.  The height of the release is at ground level.  Even though we have a relatively low population in the surrounding area of the Wastewater Treatment Plant, we selected an Urban topography as directed in the RMP Submit instructions because of the surrounding buildings that represent obstructions.\n\nThe endpoint of our worst case scenario is 1.1 miles.  Offsite consequences from the worst case include an effected population of 2,350 people.  Within the 1.1 mile radius is residential housing and numerous recreation areas owned by the City of Sault Ste. Marie.  Additionally, there is a Michigan National Guard Armory.\n\nThe worst case scenario is highly unlikely due to the fact that it requires liquid chlorine to escape from the container.

Due to the staff's extreme care and extensive training in the handling of the ton containers, this is also highly unlikely.\n\n5.  Alternate Chlorine Release Scenario\n\nOur alternate release scenario is designed to represent the most likely type of chlorine release.  It estimates the loss of gaseous chlorine if a 1/4\" line was broken and it released gaseous chlorine at a rate of 9# per minute for 10 minutes.  It also represents weather conditions that are more frequent at the Wastewater Treatment Plant: a 3 meter per second wind speed with a class D atmospheric stability.  We also chose a rural topography for our alternate release, because there are relatively few obstructions within the immediate surrounding area of the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  All other data is the same as in the worst case scenario.\n\n \nThe endpoint for our alternate release scenario is 0.2 miles.  A 0.2 mile radius contains a population of 130 people.  The alternate release scenario model is also from the EPA RMPComp program.\n\nThe chance of breakage on a 1/4\" chlorine line is very remote.  Strictly followed procedures, extensive training, newly installed chlorine equipment, and excellent preventive maintenance are just some of the tools our staff uses to prevent even the smallest of chlorine leaks from occurring.\n\n6.  5 Year Accident History\n\nThe City of Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant has never had a release of chlorine since the plant was commissioned in 1960.\n\n7.

The Wastewater Treatment Plant staff are regularly training in the use of all emergency equipment.\n\n8.  The future of the Wastewater Treatment Plant Chlorination & Operation of Chlorination Equipment.\n\nThe City of Sault Ste. Marie Wastewater Treatment Plant is undergoing an estimated $80 million up grade project. Part of this project is building a chemical storage building to house tanks for sodium hypochlorite. Once completed the Wastewater Treatment Plant will no longer use chlorine 1-ton containers but instead a less reactive sodium hypochlorite. This switch over is expected to take place in 2025. Once this switchover has happened the Wastewater Treatment Plant will be delisted as an RMP site. \n\nOur primary mission is to maintain and protect the integrity of the St. Mary's River for recreational and industrial us.  We also strongly believe in protecting our downstream neighbors drinking water supplies.  Our current chlorination equipment is the safest and most effective way of meeting these goals at this time.  Our broad and comprehensive approach to chemical safety and our well trained and conscientious employees more than compensate for any inherent dangers present from the chlorine that is beneficial to the health and welfare of our City and neighboring communities.\n\nKirk Tews\nWater Director\nCity of Sault Ste. Marie"
