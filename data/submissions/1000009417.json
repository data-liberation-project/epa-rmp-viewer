The Shelbyville Power, Water and Sewerage Systems accidental release prevention and emergency response program for the Shelbyville Wastewater Plant was created by system personnel and outside agencies that specialize in hazard assessment and prevention.\n\nThe Shelbyville Wastewater Plant is located at 525 West Jackson Street next to the Duck River at mile 221.3. The wastewater plant uses gaseous chlorine as a disinfectant in the wastewater treatment process. The plant chlorine room houses the chlorine feed equipment, including the chlorinators, one-ton chlorine cylinders and chain hoist.  The chlorine storage room can store up to a maximum of three one-ton cylinders.  In general, one of the three cylinders is hooked up to the chlorine feed header.\n\nThe maximum amount of chlorine on hand would be three one-ton cylinders.  The chlorine room is located adjacent to the main control building.  Operators and maintenance personnel check the chlorine room several times each day.\n\nOur safety philosophy is oriented toward affirmative control and minimization of risk at the greatest extent possible. To this end, every reasonable effort will be made in achieving the goal of accident prevention and health preservation. We have had zero accidental releases of chlorine in the last five years. We completed and implemented a Process Safety Management Plan and emergency response procedures concerning chlorine storage and handling. These plans include, but are not limited to, employee training on safe handling of chlorine and response procedures to a chlorine leak, and a review of the chlorine system including a process hazard analysis. \n\nThe chlorine system building includes the following safety equipment; chlo"

The wastewater plant is also staffed 24 hours a day with operators performing routine visual checks of the chlorine process.\n\nThe Shelbyville Wastewater Treatment Plant has coordinated their response plans with the Bedford County Emergency Management Director, Shelbyville Fire Department, Shelbyville Police Department and a contracted Emergency Response Team to properly respond to and mitigate any accidental chlorine releases.  Thereby limiting the severity of such releases and their impact on both public health and environment."
