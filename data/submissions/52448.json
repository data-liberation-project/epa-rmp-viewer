Other processing at this facility includes ingredient cherry processing, processing fruits for drying, fruit drying, and finished product packing.  Our mission is to produce quality fruit products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe covered PSM-RMP process for this facility includes:\n\nSulfur Dioxide:  Sulfur Dioxide gas is transferred from either 90 ton railcars or 5 tone cylinders.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brines that preserve, firm, and bleach the cherries.  This process is essential to preserve cherry quality.  To assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained, qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Oregon Cherry Growers has a long standing safety program which includes annual SO2 training for all brine making crewe, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible.  Process team members assist in the update of our procedures and safety information.\n\nTo assure accidental releases are prevented, Oregon Cherry Growers has a continuing safety program for Sulfur Dioxide.  All process procedures are written and closely monitored by trained, qualified employees.  These include checklists for operations, written operations porcedures, regular equipment inspection, and maintaining a comprehensive training program to keep operators alert to safe operations.  Emergency Response activities are reviewed and updated annually.  Emergency reponse training is included in pre-harvest training activities.\n\nPlanned improvements include additional coordinated training with local emergency response agencies and applying the principles of continuous improvement to all chemical handlin"
