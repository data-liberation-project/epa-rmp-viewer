This Risk Management Plan (RMP) involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response services available in the community. \n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe Franklin Transloading Facility is located at 2124 Overcash Ave., Chambersburg, PA 17202. The Facility stores and transfers an RMP regulated flammable mixture (AB85) above the threshold quantity. The mixture contains propane and butane which are both present in concentrations greater than 1% in the mixture. Because the facility is also subject to the Process Safety Management (PSM) standard for these flammables, it is subject to the Program 3 requirements.\n\nThe covered process begins at the AB85 railcars that are stored at the facility and ends at the portable transloading skid that is used to fill tanker trucks. \n\nThe maximum inventory of the flammable mixture is ten (10) railcars or 1,400,000 lbs. No regulated toxic substances above the threshold quantity are used at the facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nFranklin has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68 of the EPA. The facility's overall approach and commitment to chemical safety is demonstrated primarily by the"

      "SummaryText": " PSM program. The facility has implemented a Program 3 level Prevention Program that coincides with the PSM program, as required by the RMP rules. These prevention program provisions are specifically intended to minimize the probability and consequences of accidental releases from the facility and include such measures as a process hazard analysis, operating and maintenance procedures, training, compliance auditing, management system, and management of change. The facility prevention program is an ongoing system based on periodic training, process hazard analysis, incident investigations, audits, procedure revisions, and RMP updates as required to reflect facility change and RMP requirements. The facility prevention program is maintained in accordance with best practices. Additionally, Franklin's management structure for RMP implementation involves many key facility personnel including the PSM Coordinator, management staff, technical and engineering staff, and environmental and safety personnel\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nThe facility is new and has had no RMP-reportable accident/releases within the five years proceeding this RMP submittal.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Action Plan which addresses the required elements for emergency planning and response. Franklin has coordinated with the local fire department for response to accidental releases of propane.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nFranklin is committed to continuous improvement and looks for opportunities to improve safety systems and programs at the facility.\n\n"
