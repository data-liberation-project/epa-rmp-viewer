      "SummaryText": "Introduction\n\n\n\nA facility that uses or stores more than a threshold quantity of a regulated substance is required to submit a Risk Management Program (RMP) to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  An RMP comprises several elements, including an evaluation of potential accident scenarios and a comprehensive program to prevent accidental releases of regulated chemicals. \n\n\n\nThe RMP summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that the facility uses in combination to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases to the surrounding community.  The RMP includes the following information:\n\n\n\n- Introduction;\n\n- Facility identification, regulated substances, and covered processes;\n\n- Policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\n\n- Hazard Assessment;\n\n- Prevention Program;\n\n- Five-Year Accident History;\n\n- Emergency Response Plan; and\n\n- Planned Changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nKinder Morgan Liquids Terminals (KMLT) submitted an update of the RMP for KMLT's Argo Illinois Terminal on June 26, 2006 for removal of Tank C-11 from cyclohexylamine storage service at the Argo Terminal.  On November 4, 2009, KMLT submitted an update of the RMP for addition of Tank W-1 for ethylenediamine storage service at the Argo Terminal. This 2012 update is for the removal of ethylenediamine storage service at the Argo Terminal, effective December 2011.\n\n\n\nThe Argo Terminal stores vinyl acetate, a regulated toxic material under the RMP Program with a threshold quantity of 15,000 pounds. \n\n\n\nFacility Identification and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe KMLT Argo Terminal is a public \"for-hire\" bulk liquid storage terminal, approximately 145 acres in area and located approximately 15 miles southwest of the Chicago, Illinois.  GATX Terminals Corporation owned and operated the Argo Terminal from 1951 until it was acquired by KMLT in March 2001.  The terminal is bounded by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to the west, Corn Products Corpo"

      "SummaryText": "ration to the north, Archer Avenue to the east, and the Shell Oil Terminal and the Univar Distribution Facility to the south.  Bedford Park Fire Station Number 1 is located at the entrance to the Argo Terminal.  The terminal provides tank storage for liquid chemicals, petroleum, food grade products, and raw materials on a \"contract\" basis.  Presently approximately 215 permitted aboveground storage tanks are available (approximately 111,000,000 gallon capacity) for storage and distribution of customer products or for support activities.  Materials are received at the terminal by tank trucks, rail cars, barge, and pipeline.   \n\n\n\nOf the permitted aboveground storage tanks, one tank, Tank 5-15 (for storage of vinyl acetate) is covered by the RMP regulation. Tank 5-15 has a total capacity of 215,000 gallons, but is restricted to a maximum working volume of 187,754 gallons to limit air emissions. \n\n\n\nPolicies to Protect Health, Safety and the Environment\n\n\n\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at the Argo Terminal.  This RMP formalizes and documents these activities.  The facility is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner and to reducing risks to human health and the environment. KMLT Argo Terminal reviews its safety and operating procedures annually to ensure accurate information is presented therein.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program \n\n\n\nAn Accidental Release Prevention Program is in place to minimize the risk of hazardous chemical releases in accordance with the EPA Risk Management Program requirements (40 CFR 68). This prevention program covers those processes that handle regulated substances above the threshold amount.  The prevention program provides a structured approach to preventing accidents. Some of the specific activities in the prevention program include:\n\n\n\n- Keeping process safety information accessible at all times.\n\n- Conducting a hazard review as part of the preparations for RMP compliance.\n\n- Using written operating pr"

Examples of safety equipment in place include pressure relief devices, leak detection, and monitoring systems.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, process operators receive extensive training in the safe operation of the process and are required to follow detailed operating procedures to help ensure safety.  The facility also has implemented a maintenance program to monitor the physical condition of process equipment, and replace or repair equipment before it fails.\n\n\n\nIn the unlikely event of a spill or release involving a hazardous material, the Argo Terminal has developed an emergency response plan providing procedures to be followed to minimize the potential impacts of a fire at the facility. In the event of a release, the facility calls the Bedford Park Fire Department located at the facility boundary.\n\n\n\nHazard Evaluation\n\n\n\nUnder the EPA regulations, the facility is required to evaluate the potential consequences of a worst case release and various alternate release scenarios.  The following paragraphs provide a description of the worst case and alternate scenarios for the base. \n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations define a worst-case release as \"the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in Sections 68.22 (a)\" (40 CFR 68.3). The worst-case release scenario for toxic liquids assumes that the total quantity in a vessel is spilled instantaneously onto a flat non-absorbing surf"

The release rate to air is estimated as the rate of evaporation from the pool of spilled toxic liquid.  Each tank at the Argo Terminal is located within a diked area. \n\n\n\nFor Tank 5-15 (capacity 187,700 gallons), it is assumed that the contents of the tank empty instantaneously to a diked area.  The diked area is capable of holding the capacity of the largest tank, plus sufficient freeboard to allow for precipitation.  The evaporation rate is then determined using U.S. EPA's RMP*Comp program to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint. \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nFor the 2009 RMP update, KMLT reported that no accidents had occurred during the previous five years. No accidents have occurred since the 2009 update was submitted.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\n\n\nThe RMP regulations require that \"response actions have been coordinated with local emergency planning and response agencies\" (40 CFR 68.12(b)(3)).   Emergency response activities at the Argo Terminal are coordinated with the Cook County Central LEPC and Bedford Park Fire Department.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nSafety and Emergency Preparedness is a part of the facility's activities.  Exposure risks to employees and the public have been minimized through ongoing inspections, maintenance, and capital improvements.  Further improvements will continue to be implemented as appropriate."
