      "SummaryText": "ord Volunteer Fire Department and the West Deptford County LEPC at least annually and periodically reviews and retrains employees in the Emergency Action Plan.\r\n\r\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Facility is to act as a liquefied petroleum gas and flammable liquid storage and distribution facility.  Due to the flammable effects associated with butane and pentane, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  The Facility is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the facility depends on the manner in which flammable substances are handled as well as the safety devices incorporated into the design of the processes. The Facility complies with the OSHA Process Safety Management Program for Highly Hazardous Chemicals (29 CFR 1910.119) and provides comprehensive training to employees and contractors that reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the facility. Programs are in place to help prevent any accidental releases and employees are trained for the appropriate emergency response in the event of a release. \r\n\r\nFor planning purposes, SPMT has considered the impact of worst case and alternative release scenarios.  The probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. The worst case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes such as tornadoes and floods that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. SPMT also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment event. SPMT has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. SPMT has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. SPMT provides annual emergency response training to its employees.\r\nSPMT reports all significant acc"

      "SummaryText": "The Eagle Point NJ Facility includes Sunoco Partners Marketing & Terminals (SPMT) Eagle Point Tank Farm and Eagle Point Sales Terminal. The Eagle Point NJ Facility, hereafter referred to as the Facility, is a refined petroleum product storage and distribution facility in Westville, New Jersey. The Facility handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, No. 2 fuel oil, butane, pentane, ethanol, and various petroleum based additives.\r\n\r\nThe Facility has fixed inventories of butane and pentane and operates two butane/pentane processes. In Process 1, butane is received by truck and stored in three (3) approximately 12,000 barrel spheres and pentane is received by truck and stored in one (1) approximately 12,000 barrel sphere. As needed, butane or pentane is injected into gasoline streams throughout the facility based on sampling results. In Process 2, pentane is received by truck and stored in one (1) approximately 60,000 gallon horizontal storage vessel and subsequently injected into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck loading rack. The Facility maintains a Facility Response Plan and coordinates emergency response with the local LEPC and responders at least annually.\r\n\r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Facility:\r\n\r\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. SPMT is committed to the safe operation of the Facility to ensure a safe workplace for employees and a safe location for the Facility's neighbors.  SPMT has procedures in place to prevent or mitigate the effects of accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both within the Facility and community-wide.  SPMT coordinates with the West Deptf"
