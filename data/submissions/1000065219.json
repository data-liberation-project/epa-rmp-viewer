The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source\r\n\r\nTo address concerns of an accidental release, prevention and emergency response, all plant and field personnel are trained in ammonia emergency response procedures and use of appropriate protective equipment. Refresher training and emergency response drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel are equipped, trained, prepared, and practiced in responding to ammonia emergencies. \r\n\r\nAs a result of information gathered during preparation of this Risk Management Program, the NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. is committing additional resources to further increase employee awareness and equipment reliability and to establish operator training and preventive maintenance programs. As a demonstration of the NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. 's high degree of commitment to public safety and service, the NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. is taking action to decrease the risk of ammonia exposure to the public by implementing recommendations made during the Process Hazards Analysis and Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\n\r\n2.

The Worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\r\n\r\nA Worst-Case Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis and an Alternative Scenario Offsite Consequence Analysis were performed identifying the public and environmental receptors within the toxic endpoint concentration radius of 200 ppm. The results are mitigated by the fact that all the vessels and the much of the piping are inside the NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. building. A variety of administrative controls and computerized controls are in place to shut the system down when operating parameters and limits are exceeded.\r\n\r\n4. The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific preventative steps\r\n\r\nThe basic elements of the Program 3 Prevention program have been developed and are now in place.

The five-year accident history\r\n\r\nThere have been no incidents or accidents at the facility that meet the threshold for reporting for to the EPA in the past five (5) years. To prevent and/or minimize any potential future release of anhydrous ammonia, the NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. is implementing a detailed Process Safety Management program (Preventive Program 3).\r\n\r\n6. The emergency response program\r\n\r\nEmergency response is discussed in the Risk Management Program (RMP) binder of the complete program. NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. has a detailed Emergency Response Plan for their facility. The purpose of this plan is to provide the means for rapidly determining the appropriate response for any emergency that may develop at the facility such as an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  The NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. conducts scheduled drills of the emergency response plan. The Emergency Response Program is written, includes specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release, includes procedures for informing the public and local agencies responsible for responding to an accidental release, and includes information on emergency health care.\r\n\r\n7. Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nThe NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. is incorporating and addressing any recommendations resulting from the Process Hazard Analysis, Offsite Consequences, and program audits. The flexibility of the program allows the NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. to respond effectively to prevent or minimize any potential exposure of NUESKE'S MEAT PRODUCT, INC. employees, the surrounding public, and/or the environment to a release of anhydrous ammonia. Specific actions taken to improve safety are the implementation of the Program 3 Prevention Program described above, improved operator training, administrative controls, and computerized system controls."
