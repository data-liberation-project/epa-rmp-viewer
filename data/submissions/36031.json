All OCA release modeling was performed using the ABS Group, Inc. RMPlanner 2.0 software tool.  This tool is based on the 1996 EPA OCA Guidance Tables.  Population estimates, public receptors and environmental receptors were analyzed using the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, BUREAU OF THE CENSUS Landview ? IV Environmental Mapping Software (2003).\n\n1. Worst-Case Toxic Release Scenario - Chlorine\n\nThe worst-case scenario is an instantaneous failure of a cylinder that results in a release of  2,000 lbs. of chlorine over a 10 minute period.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  No passive mitigation (i.e. containment) credit was applied to the release model calculation.  The RMP toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L based on the AIHA ERPG-2 level) was calculated at 4.5 miles (23,700 ft.).  A population estimate of 15,194 people offsite, including residential, religious, recreational, school, commercial, and environmental receptors could be potentially affected by the release.\n\nAlthough the RMP rule does not allow credit for mechanical safety systems on worst-case scenarios, there are various prevention measures that significantly reduce the potential of a worst-case scenario.  These measures include:\n\n- Review of supplier hydrostatic testing program for chlorine cylinders\n- Visual inspection of cylinders when brought on-site\n- Barriers to protect the cylinders from external damage\n- Flow regulators which control the flow of chlorine under vacuum \n- Operating procedures on chlorine cylinder changeouts\n- Routine operator surveillance and leak detection \n\n2.

      "SummaryText": "000 lb. chlorine release due to the failure of a 9/16\" fusible plug on the cylinder.  The fusible plug failure is assumed to fail on the liquid side of a full cylinder and was estimated to empty the cylinder contents in approximately 10 minutes.  No passive (i.e. containment) mitigations were applied to the release model calculation. The release calculation also assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  Operator surveillance allows for detection and intervention within 3-5 minutes.  Area firewater monitors would be activated to apply water on the release.  This scenario was selected because of a 1998 incident in the industry which involved a  fusible plug failure on the vapor side of a chlorine cylinder.   The RMP toxic endpoint (0.0087 mg/L based on the AIHA ERPG-2 level) was calculated at 1.5 miles (7820 ft.).  A population estimate of 3,682 people offsite, including residential, recreational, religious, school, and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.  The prevention steps used to manage chlorine cylinders (identified in the WCS above) significantly reduce the potential of this scenario occurrence.\n\n3. Worst-Case Flammable Release Scenario - Flammable Mixture\n\nThe worst-case scenario for a flammable release assumes the instantaneous failure, release, and vapor cloud explosion of 8,000,000 lbs. of a flammable mixture (butane, 1,3-butadiene, isopentane, and pentane) from a process vessel in the OL-5 process.  Although the vessel operates liquid filled to 50% capacity, there are no procedures to regulate inventory.  Therefore, the vessel had to be assumed liquid full per the RMP requirements for WCS analysis.  No passive (i.e. containment) mitigation credit was applied to the release model calculations.  The release calculation also assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI end"

A population estimate of 3,770 people offsite, including residential, recreational, religious, school and commercial receptors could be potentially affected by the release.  No environmental receptors were identified.\n\n4. Alternative flammable Release Scenario - Propylene\n\nThe alternate flammable scenario involves a 40,000 lb. propylene release and vapor cloud explosion resulting from a valve stem blowout on a 48\" power assisted check valve downstream of a propylene compressor.  The release calculation assumes urban topography due to the close proximity of congested process areas and a 5 minute release duration before explosion.  This scenario was selected because of a 1997 incident in the industry involving a similar event in an identical process.   It is assumed that release detection would be immediate due to the noise generated by a high pressure release.  Operator intervention is assumed to deactivate the compressor to stop propylene flow, as well as activate area firewater monitors to contain any fire and cool equipment.  The maximum impact distance to a 1 PSI endpoint was calculated at 0.11 miles (588 ft.).  A population estimate of 0 people offsite, including commercial receptors could be potentially impacted by the release.

Participants include employees from Operations, Maintenance, Engineering & Technical Support and Management. \n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant maintains a variety of technical documents to ensure the safe operation of its processes.  The Process Safety Management policy requires operating departments maintain and update PSI applicable to their processes.  Chemical-specific information is contained in material safety data sheets (MSDS'), including properties, exposure hazards, emergency response, and exposure treatment considerations.  Other PSI documents include, but are not limited to process drawings, descriptions of safe operating parameters and limits, chemical inventories, basis for process design, safeguarding, protective instrument and equipment construction information.  Many of the documents, including MSDS' are electronically available to all NCP employees and Contractors.   The Process Safety Management policy also includes a summary table to assist employees in locating process safety information documents and drawings.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHAs)\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant maintains a comprehensive Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) program to identify and control hazards associated with its processes.  These include processes covered under one or a combination of: (1) RMP Program 3, (2) OSHA PSM, and (3) Shell internal criteria.  NCP uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) PHA methodology to conduct process unit PHAs.  PHA team members must include experienced employees with operating, maintenance, and engineering backgrounds who are familiar with the affected process.

All safety related PHA findings are risk ranked to ensure mitigation measures receive timely attention based on their risk priority.  All PHA findings are forwarded to local Management for review and resolution.  Safety related mitigations approved by Management begin immediately after Management review, starting with the highest risk scenarios.   When a final mitigation can not be implemented within a reasonable time (e.g. hardware change scheduled to a unit maintenance turnaround), interim solutions such as administrative controls (i.e. operating and work practice changes) must be implemented to mitigate the risk.  PHA mitigations are tracked on a quarterly basis until resolved.  Process unit PHA's are revalidated every 5 years for the life of the process.  Written PHA reports are also retained for the life of the process.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nNorco Chemical Plant operating departments maintain written procedures to address a variety of operating modes such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide a reference to experience operators, as well as serve as a training tool for new operators.  Each PSM covered operating department must annually certify their procedures as current and accurate.  The management of change process is also used to ensure operating procedures are updated as necessary to reflect changes in the process unit.  Operating procedures are accessible to all NCP employees either electronically or in hard copy.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant implements a comprehensive training program for all operating, maintenance, and technical personnel.  New operating employees receive classroom training on basic operating principles and the operating procedures of their process.  In addition to classroom traini"

Along with routine operating practices, the training places a significant emphasis on unit specific safety and health hazards, and emergency operating conditions (including shutdown).  Employees involved in operating a process must be qualified to perform the job on that process.  Operators must re-qualify on their jobs every three (3) years and work a predesignated number of hours by job to maintain qualification.  Competency is assessed through a combination of methods such as written and oral tests, and demonstrating skills in the field.  The training program complements the written operating procedures to ensure operating employees are properly qualified for their job.  All training is documented and managed by the NCP Training Department.\n\nContractors \n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant routinely uses contractors to supplement its maintenance and technical workforce, particularly during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Since contractors may work on or near process equipment, NCP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors have the proper knowledge, skills, and training to perform their work in a safe manner prior to working on-site.  Contractor safety programs and performance are primary factors influencing the Contractor selection process.  Contractors are routinely monitored by a Contract Coordinator to ensure compliance with regulatory and Shell requirements.  Contractor safety performance is also part of NCP weekly safety statistics communications to employees and contractors. \n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Norco Chemical Plant conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  In addition, major projects and maintenance turnarounds require a PSSR to be completed.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features such as P&ID and other process drawings, operat"
