      "SummaryText": "FACILITY DESCRIPTION\nThe North Key Largo Utility Corporation (NKLUC) operates the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for the community of Ocean Reef located in North Key Largo.  The wastewater plant uses gaseous chlorine for disinfection of treated wastewater effluent prior to disposal to underground injection wells.  Disinfection is accomplished by the use of two chlorine ton cylinders that are interconnected with an automatic switchover valve.  The NKLUC usually maintains a maximum of two cylinders located at the site.  Both cylinders are connected to the automatic switchover and when one cylinder empties and switches over to the full cylinder, a new cylinder is ordered.  The WWTP does not have the space for additional storage.\n\nThe chlorine cylinders are stored outside with a hood open at both ends used to shield the cylinders from the direct sunlight.  The vacuum regulator is connected directly to the cylinder and should there be a loss of vacuum due to line break, the chlorine feed would cease due to the loss of vacuum.  The chlorine feed equipment is also located outside near the cylinders and chlorine contact chamber where chlorine is utilized for disinfection at the wastewater treatment plant.  The wastewater plant is staffed 6 hours per day, 5 days per week and checked each weekend day.  It is also located in a fenced area that is secured when staff is not present.  Plant operations involving the use of chlorine is performed by personnel specifically trained in the use of handling chlorine.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nNKLUC maintains safety and emergency information regarding chlorine at the wastewater treatment plant.  Personnel use utmost care with the use and storage of chlorine gas and visually inspect feed equipment when cylinders are changed out to verify equipment is operating and minor leaks are not present.\n\nEmergency response, in the events of a release, is handled through the Ocean Reef Department of Public Safet"

      "SummaryText": "y Emergency Response and Action Plan for Responses to Hazardous Material Incidents.  The Public Safety personnel will be responsible for initial response, coordination, public communication, recovery and cleanup.  If necessary, the Public Safety Department has also coordinated with the Miami-Dade Hazardous Response team and have established a mutual agreement for situations involving hazardous chemicals that are beyond the training of Ocean Reef personnel.  Miami/Dade Fire/Rescue is the designated hazardous materials response team in the southeast and for Monroe County.\n\nCHEMICAL RELEASE SCENARIOS\nAs part of the preparation of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), NKLUC reviewed several scenarios involving the release of chlorine using RMP Comp.  The ?worst-case? scenario involved the loss of all the contents of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine.  Using the regulatory requirements outlined by the RMP Comp model.  If a release were to occur, approximately a radius of 1.4 miles around the plant would be affected.  The risks of the scenarios occurring are considered minimal since the condition leading to this type of release is rare.  In considering alternate release scenarios that may be more likely due to a faulty valve, it was determined that a potential radius of 0.1 miles around the wastewater plant could be affected.  This area is primarily the service village with a small portion of the neighboring air strip and golf course affected.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe wastewater plant has not experienced any accidental releases of chlorine within the last five years.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nNKLUC has safety policies and procedures in place to prevent the accidental releases of chlorine.  Trained personnel are present when chlorine cylinders are loaded and unloaded from the chemical supplier.  Equipment is also inspected every time the chlorine cylinders are changed out.  NKLUC has adopted a pollution prevention program which addresses process hazard analysis,"

The NKLUC is also in the process of evaluating chlorine gas alternatives and the use of sodium hypochlorite in lieu of gaseous chlorine.  If this alternative is implemented further updates ti the RMP and pollution prevention program will no longer be required."
