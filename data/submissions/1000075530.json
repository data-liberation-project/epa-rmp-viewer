In the event of a fire emergency, the Carlyss or Sulphur Fire Department is directly notified.  This policy is only used when no other emergency assistance (medical, etc) is required.\n\nf) Planned changes to improve safety;\n\nSouthern Ionics recently conducted a review of the Process Hazard Analysis.  No deficiencies were found during the analysis; however, Southern Ionics noted several areas that will be reviewed more closely for potential safety improvements.  Detailed findings of this review are in the Process Hazard Analysis dated January 8, 2024."

The location is in the Calcasieu Parish.  The site occupies 21.8 acres.  The site has two non-RMP covered processes that manufacture Aluminum Sulfate and Sodium Aluminate; and one PSM / RMP covered process which manufactures ammonium hydroxide and involves the storage of anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide.  \n\nThe site has developed a risk management program to handle anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide in excess of RMP thresholds in accordance with the Risk Management Planning requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) Section 112(r) mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR Part 68).    \n\na) The accidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source;\n\nSouthern Ionics Incorporated has developed an RMP program including process safety information, mechanical integrity, operational procedures, and emergency response programs for handling both anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide.  Ammonium hydroxide concentrations will range from 15-32%.  Emergency response procedures detail fire, emergency spills / releases, evacuation, medical emergencies, and notification requirements.  \n\nb) The stationary source and regulated substances handled; \n\nThe facility receives and stores anhydrous ammonia and converts the anhydrous ammonia into 15-32% ammonium hydroxide.  The site also stores 19.5% and 29.5% ammonium hydroxide (aqua ammonia).  Anhydrous ammonia is converted into ammonium hydroxide concentration by mixing with purified DI water.  Aqua ammonia is sold to customers and shipped from the site in truck tankers, rail cars and pipeline.  \n\nThere is 1-30,000 gallon capacity anhydrous ammonia pressurized storage tank which can hold 150,000 lbs.  This tank is limited to 85% capacity"
