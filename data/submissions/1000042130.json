The facility is subject to the requirements of the EPA's Risk Management Plan rule in accordance with Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).  The WWTP treats municipal and industrial wastes prior to disposal to Higgens Branch.\n\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible citizen very seriously.  Glasgow Water Company facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact.  Glasgow Water Company's policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent incidents, including the release of hazardous materials, and to train employees in prevention of incidents.\n\nGlasgow Water Company has developed and implemented Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each operations facility as part of an overall chemical management program.  The program involves the superintendents at each facility along with the plant operators.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe WWTP has developed a PSM plan as part of the overall chemical management program.  The program involves the superintendent and all operators at the facility.  WWTP personnel also provide safety training to staff as part of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nDescription of Facility and the Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Glasgow WWTP is located at 705 Glen Garry Road in Glasgow, Kentucky, just south of the Glasgow Regional Landfill.  This facility began operation in 1960.  The WWTP's chlorination and dechlorination processes are covered by the EPA's 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n\n\nThe facility operates a water treatment plant (WTP) with a maximum capacity of four million gallons per day (MGD). After treatment, the waste water is discharged to Higgens Branch.  \n\n\n\nChlorine gas is i"

The chlorine system utilizes a Wallace & Tiernan vacuum operated, automatic switchover gaseous feed systems with two 1-ton containers piped together to provide uninterrupted flow of chlorine.  Currently, the feed rate for chlorine ranges from approximately 75-100 pounds per day.\n\nIn order to meet water treatment standards, the treated water must be free of residual chlorine prior to discharge.  Dechlorination is achieved by injecting sulfur dioxide gas into the treated water prior to discharge.  The sulfur dioxide system utilizes a Wallace & Tiernan vacuum operated, automatic switchover gaseous feed systems with two 1-ton containers piped together to provide uninterrupted flow of sulfur dioxide.  Currently, the feed rate for sulfur dioxide ranges from approximately 75-100 pounds per day.\n\nThe maximum chlorine inventory at the WWTP includes three 1-ton chlorine containers.  Under normal circumstances, a full container and a container in use are piped together and situated on the scale apparatus and a third 1-ton container is stored in an adjacent room separated by steel sliding doors that are kept closed unless employees are in the Scale Room.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe WWTP maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The WWTP also utilizes preventative maintenance programs for its system components.  The preventative maintenance program for the chlorination system is conducted in conformance with recommendations from the equipment manufacturers and from the Chlorine Institute.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\n\n\nThere have been no process-related accidents within the last five years at the Waste Water Treatment Plant.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe WWTP has implemented an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA PSM regulations.

The written Emergency Action Plan contains specific information regarding evacuation and notification procedures in the event of a catastrophic chlorine release.\n\nThe Glasgow Fire Department has conducted a reconnaissance of the facility and trained personnel are ready to respond if requested.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe WWTP is in the process of implementing safety improvements as recommended by its Process Hazard Analysis and its PSM-RMP Compliance Audit program.  Those improvements should be completed by December 31, 2014.\n\n"
