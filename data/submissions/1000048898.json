Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192 has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192 now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a living document.

The facility has an ammonia refrigeration system that provides refrigerating capacity to ten (10) cold storage rooms, seven (7) precool rooms, three (3) mini-rooms, and a shipping area.  The rooms utilize bunker mounted evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receiver is piped to each flooded zone of refrigeration, where it passes through a solenoid valve, an expansion valve, and into a low temperature & pressure accumulator vessel mounted behind the bunker wall. From the accumulators, cold liquid ammonia is circulated through evaporator coils. As heat is absorbed, the liquid ammonia vaporizes to form low temperature & pressure gas which is returned to the accumulator vessels. The ammonia vapor is returned from the accumulator vessels through a suction return line to our main suction accumulator in the engine room. From there, it passes through the compressors. The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure gas ammonia is cooled, liquefied and returned to our high pressure receiver.  Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator drains into the liquid transfer vessel.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point th"

As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary. To accomplish this, Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192 has elected to use PSMWriter, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc. This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \r\n\r\n1.1 Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192, Risk and Process Safety Management Program\r\n\r\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Sunview Cold Storage - Road 192 has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

Since then the following significant projects have occurred:\r\n- Mid 1990's - B&W Refrigeration increased the size of the evaporator coils, accumulators, fans, and control valves in Storage Rooms 1-8\r\n- 1996 - B&W Refrigeration installed the refrigeration equipment for the Shipping Room\r\n- Early 2000's - B&W Refrigeration increased the size of the evaporator coils, accumulators, fans, and control valves in Precool 1 and 2\r\n\r\nThe system contain numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  Lastly, an emergency dump box contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe ammonia system at our facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected. Therefore, we are treating the system as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\n1.3.1 General \r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nSunview Cold Storage - Road 192 has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release.
