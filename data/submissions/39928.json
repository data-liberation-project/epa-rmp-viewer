The chemical products sold by VWR are received from manufacturers in U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved containers (typically ranging from 1 pint to 55 gallons in volume ).  VWR does not manufacture, formulate or otherwise engage in direct handling of chemicals outside of the containers in which the chemicals are received.  VWR operations consist of warehousing and distribution activities, and the risk of a serious chemical-related emergency is low.  However, VWR has a strong commitment to the safety and well-being of its employees, the environment and the surrounding community.  The company has established a management system, consisting of policies, procedures, training, inspection, maintenance and other elements that are designed to prevent incidents from occurring.  In the event a minor or major emergency does occur, facility personnel have been trained to effectively manage the incident.\n\nAll warehousing operating involving regulated chemicals are considered a single \u00bfcovered process\u00bf for regulatory purposes.  The VWR facility is considered to be covered under the Program 2 eligibility requirements (per 68.10(c)) because VWR is not covered by one of the SIC codes listed under Program 3 nor OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nAt the present time, only Ethyl Either exceeds the Threshold Quantity (TQ) for that substance under federal Clean Air Act 112(r) with a maximum quantity in 2003 of 10,000 lbs. that is equal to the TQ.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is based on a hypothetical incident in which the single largest container stored at the site, a 200 liter metal drum, is pierced by a forklift and/or the contents are otherwise spilled on the floor of the distribution center.  RMP Comp, a software program furnished by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was used to determine the farthest distance to the \u00bfflammable endpoint\u00bf.  Results"

According to the analysis the distance to the flammable endpoint was also equal to one-tenth of a mile (0.1 mile) or less.  The alternative release scenario endpoint was calculated based on EPA\u00bfs vapor cloud fire release type.\n\nAdministrative controls and active mitigation measures were not included as a factor of consideration during the worst case or alternative release scenarios.  However, both release scenarios considered indoor releases contained by dikes or berms in the flammable storage room.\n\nVWR\u00bfs prevention program consists of several key elements, including:\n\u00b7\tSafety Information \u00bf includes detailed information about the hazards of the regulated chemicals, maximum intended inventory, facility design features, applicable standards, equipment use and maintenance.\n\n\u00b7\tHazard Review \u00bf a process of evaluating facility operations, using warehouse industry checklists, to identify and control potential hazards.\n\n\u00b7\tStandard Operating Procedures \u00bf written SOP\u00bfs to guide employees in safety conducting normal, temporary and non-routine/emergency operations.\n\n\u00b7\tTraining \u00bf includes training commensurate with the types of activities employees are expected to perform during normal and emergency situations.\n\n\u00b7\tMaintenance \u00bf required maintenance activities are performed by trained employees or qualified workers.\n\n\u00b7\tCompliance Audits \u00bf conducted at least once every three years to verify compliance with regulatory requirements for Accidental Release Prevention.\n\n\u00b7\tIncident Investigation \u00bf conducted whenever an incident occurs that results in, or could have resulted in, a catastrophic release (i.e., a release that presents an"

Additionally, all chemicals are segregated and stored by hazard class to ensure that incompatible chemicals are not stored together.\n\nThere have been no accidents in the previous five years that have resulted in any deaths or significant property damage on-site, or any off-site deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering from regulated substances or otherwise.
