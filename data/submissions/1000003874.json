              "Description": "The HF Acid Alkylation Unit is in compliance with OSHA PSM requirements, which includes regular equipment inspections, equipment and material testing, operator training, pre-startup safety reviews, management of changes, employee participation, compilation and review of process safety information, process hazard analyses, operating procedures, compliance audits, incident investigations, and safe work practices.  These programs have been in place for several years and are the heart of our accident prevention program.  The process has a detailed Process Safety Manual, and the site has an Emergency Response Action Plan and a Facility Response Plan.  Operators have been trained on the contents of the plans.   Big West Oil Company is part of the Petroleum Mutual Aid Program, in which other area refineries will help one another in the event of an emergency.  Big West Oil Company also maintains hazardous materials and fire brigade crews made up of employee volunteers.  The crews train twice per month.  A fully equipped HAZMAT vehicle and three fire trucks are also maintained on site for use by the emergency response teams.  Additional mitigation measures are also in place to reduce any release that may occur.  These measures include water canons to reduce the amount of acid that may be released.",

              "Description": "The LPG storage area stores Big West Oil Company's propane, butane, and isobutane.  The tanks are equipped with radar/sonar tank level indicators which are monitored from a central control room.  The LPG storage area is in compliance with OSHA PSM requirements, which includes regular equipment inspections, equipment and material testing, operator training, pre-startup safety reviews, management of changes, employee participation, compliance audits, incient investigations, and safe work practices.  These programs have been in place for several years and are the heart of our accident prevetion program.  The process has a detailed Process Safety Manual, and the site has an Emergency Response Action Plan and a Facility Response Plan.  Operators have been trained on the contents of the plans.  Big West Oil LLC is part of the Petroleum Mutual Aid Program, in which other area refineries will help one another in the event of an emergency.  Big West Oil LLC also maintains hazardous materials and fire brigade crews made up of employee volunteers.  The crews train twice per month.  A fully equipped HAZMAT vehicle and three fire trucks are also maintained on site for use by the emergency response teams.  Additional mitigation measures are also in place to reduce any release that may occur.  These measures include water canons to reduce the amount of chemical that may be released.",

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training programs, equipment inspection programs, operating procedures, and engineering and adminstrative controls in our process.  It is our policy to adhere to all aplicable State and Federal rules and regulations.  Our main goal is to take steps necessary to prevent releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, we have trained personnel and the appropriate equipment to respond to the release and implement control and containment strategies, if they can be implemented without compromising the safety of the team.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA PSM guidelines.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire department and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\nBig West Oil LLC's Flying J refinery, located in North Salt Lake, Utah, operates a petroleum refinery whose primary products include gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, petroleum wax, kerosene,  propane, butane, and isobutane from raw crude oil.  Regulated flammable substances used or stored on site in quantities exceeding the threshold quantities include butane, isobutane, and propane.  Big West Oil LLC also stores hydrofluoric acid (anhydrous) in quantities exceeding the RMP threshold quantity.\n\n Processes at the refinery regulated by the RMP are also regulated by OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.  Big West Oil LLC's PSM program includes detailed process safety information for each process.  Big West Oil LLC conducts process hazards analyses to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage the hazards.

Changes made to refinery processes are properly managed so all applicable personnel are familiar with the change.\n\nBig West Oil LLC's chemical-specific release prevention systems include temperature, pressure, and flow alarms; and automatic shutdown systems for process parameters such as high level and high temperature.  Tanks and piping are equipped with pressure relief systems that route materials to a knock-out pot and flare.  Bulk storage tanks are located within earthen berms to contain liquid releases, and most are equipped with double bottoms.\n\nBig West Oil LLC maintains an Emergency Response Action Plan and a Facility Response Plan that describe actions to take in an emergency.  The refinery maintains an inventory of spill response and fire-fighting equipment on site, and the facility maintains hazardous materials and fire brigade crews which train twice a month.  The refinery participates in the Petroleum Mutual Aid Program in which area refineries would assist each other in the event of an emergency.  Big West Oil LLC has also coordinated its emergency response program with the Davis County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  \n\nBig West Oil LLC continues in its program to equip the bulk petroleum storage tanks with double bottoms.  We have also upgraded our fire water system and added additional firefighting equipment."
