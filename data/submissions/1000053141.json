The Cedar Ridge Facility is located near the town of Coyanosa in Reeves County, Texas. The facility is designed to separate NGLs from gathered natural gas.  NGLs are separated from condensate and produced water.  The NGLs are stored in the 18,000 gallon bullet tank and later will be transferred and processed in a natural gas processing facility. \n\n\n\nThe NGL mixture can contain the following components:\n\na. Methane\n\nb. Ethane\n\nc. Propane\n\nd. Butane\n\ne. Isobutane\n\nf. Pentane\n\ng. Isopentane\n\nh. carbons larger than C5+\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nCedar Ridge Facility is newly built and has had no RMP-regulated substance release during the past five years. \n\n\n\nPUBLIC RECEPTORS\n\n\n\nNo receptors were identified within the 0.32 mile distance to flammable endpoint.  The Cedar Ridge Facility is located within a rural area.  Using information gathered during field reconnaissance on October 6, 2015 and census tract data, it was determined that zero persons live within the distance to flammable endpoint.  No other public receptors including schools, residences, hospitals, prisons, public recreational areas or arenas, or commercial or industrial areas were observed within the distance to flammable endpoint.  In addition, no environmental receptors were identified on the local U.S. Geological Survey topographic map.\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nVaquero's Cedar Ridge Facility is a Non-Responding Facility as per 48 CFR 68.90(b). The plant maintains a written emergency action plan, which is in place to help protect employees and public safety as well as the environment. The plan identifies steps to be taken in case of an accidental release including: proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an ev"

Vaquero has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate emergency response organizations (Fire Department, Police and Sheriff's Office). This interface provides the means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition, Vaquero conducts periodic emergency drills and annual refresher training for plant personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
