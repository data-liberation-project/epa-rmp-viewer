      "SummaryText": "The Aurora Cooperative Elevator Company's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  The Aurora Cooperative emergency response plan involves the response services available in the community.  Aurora Cooperative bulk anhydrous ammonia facilities have been strategically located to provide a local retail facility for this form of affordable nitrogen fertilzier for agriculture.  This location located on U.S. Highway 30 in Chapman is made up of one (1) 30,000 gallon and one (1) 11,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels and two loadout risers.  It serves the southern Merrick and northern Hamilton County areas.  This facility is normally unmanned, except during ferilizer season, although the grain elevator and office facilities located 1000 feet southwest are normally manned during business hours.  The offsite consequence analysis includes the consideration of two anhydrous ammonia release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  the first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that the \"owner or operator shall assume that the...maximum quantity of the largest vessel...is released as a gas over a 10 minute period, due to an unspecified failure\".  The alternative release scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  Atmospheric dispersion modeling has to be performed to determine the distance traveled by the anhydrous ammonia released before it's concentration decreases to a \"non-toxic\" level.  For this purpose, Aurora Cooperative has chosen to use RMP-Comp Version 1.05 to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint (.14 mg/l or 200 ppm).  To determine the population affected by a potential release we will use maps extracted from Landview 3 software.  The worst case release scenario for Aurora Cooperative - Chapman Anhydrous Ammonia facility involves the failure of the 30,000 gallon pressurized storage vessels while i"

The alternative release scenario is based on the failure of a three inch transfer hose, assuming that the check valve fails completely and the excess flow valve in the storage tank takes 2 minutes to close.  Off-Site consequences were analyzed using RMP-Comp Version 1.05 to determine the distance to the overpressure endpoint (1 psi)."
