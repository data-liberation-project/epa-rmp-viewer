The primary purpose of this facility is to process raw beef, poultry, and pork into food products by addition of other ingredients for distribution to retailers.  This is a new plant and construction was recently completed in the fall of 2009.\n\nThe facility is subject to the USEPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) for Accidental Chemical Release regulation (40 CFR 68) because it has a refrigeration system that contains more than the threshold quantity (15,000 pounds) of anhydrous ammonia.  Anhydrous ammonia (NH3, is a gas at ambient conditions.  The initial ammonia charge to the system will be about 15,000 pounds.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to control the processing and storage temperature for products.  It is a closed system that contains ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, make-up air units, and some piping runs are located outdoors.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.\n\nAmmonia is contained in equipment in the facility and is compressed, condensed and evaporated to remove heat from within the facility to maintain safe storage areas and remove heat from the products being handled.\n\nAmmonia is classified by EPA as a toxic chemical and it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling it to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the health threat to our own workers, and reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to"

Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle the ammonia, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility, the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nAn accidental release prevention program will be in place from the initiation of addition of ammonia to the refrigeration process.  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines, and is in compliance with State codes. This food processing facility complies with EPAA?s Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State codes and regulations.\n\nAll of our ammonia refrigeration operators are trained using a formal training program. This program consists of having an effective preventive maintenance program and comprehensive employee training to insure equipment integrity.  \n\nThe process has numerous safeguards including:  \nA?  Ammonia is not corrosive in this service.    \nA?  Most of the lines are elevated or on the roof to minimize potential damage from fork lifts.  \nA?  The Plant has an overall safety program that includes employee awareness and training to minimize the potential for an accident or incident involving the ammonia refrigeration equipment.  \nA?  A process hazard analysis (PHA) was recently conducted in 2009.  A team with expertise in engineering, operations, maintenance, and safety evaluated the existing refrigeration system in depth and developed recommendations to improve the safety and operability of the system.  The PHA addressed:  (1) process hazards; (2) previous incidents; (3) engineering and administrative controls applicable to the hazards; (4) the consequence of control failure; (5) facility siting; (6) human factors; and (7) a qualitative evaluation of possible safety and health effects of control system failures.  \nA?

The SOPs include procedures for normal operations, startup, shutdown, emergency operations, and emergency shutdown.  \nA?  For projects, a management of change procedure and a pre-startup safety review are in place to ensure that system changes or expansions are safe and that the changes are consistent with the engineering design and in condition to be operated prior to startup.  \nA?  Contractors that are used to work on, or adjacent to, the refrigeration system are \"pre-qualified\" based upon their knowledge of ammonia refrigeration, understanding of applicable codes and standards, and their demonstrated ability to work safely.  Each of these contractors is evaluated from a safety perspective.  \nA?  The Plant has a program for replacement of all Safety Relief Valves on a 5 year interval as recommended by IIAR.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon Federal guidelines as they apply to this facility.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority, local emergency response agencies, and notification of any potentially affected neighbors. The facility emergency response plan is based on all known applicable regulations and requirements.  The emergency response plan has been discussed with the Dubuque Fire Department.  Representatives of the Dubuque Fire Department will be invited to visit this plant on an annual basis.  \n\nThe facility has a trained team of emergency responders that are available to respond to any ammonia release.  These trained staff members are skilled at responding to a release and isolating problem areas within the ammonia refrigeration system.  \n\nThe plant is new and therefore there have been no accidental releases of ammonia at the facility that have resulted in death, injury, or significant property damage on site or off-site death, injury, evacuation, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n"
