One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS # 26471-62-5.\n\nAs stated in our initial RMP registration, a concrete containment area for the railcar unloading station was to be constructed.  Construction of that area was delayed because of permitting and other requirements, but eventually completed in September 2001. This facility now meets the Program 1 eligibility requirements. \n\nTwo commercial blends are used at the facility.  These blends have isomer ratios of TDI 2-4 (CAS # 584-84-9) and TDI 2-6 (CAS # 91-08-7) approximately 80/20 and 65/35  respectively.  Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI 80/20 railcar into a subsurface concrete containment area.  The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in the area of concern with no public receptors being affected within a 26 yard radius of the railcar unloading station which classifies the polyether PU foam manufacturing process at this facility as a Program Level 1.  The release rate, calculated by the ALOHA model, was 0.0101 lbs./min.  Two alternate scenarios, including the rupture and spillage of TDI 80/20 from the largest storage tanks (als"

The release rates for the alternate scenarios, calculated by the ALOHA model, were from 0.0101 to 0.0177 lbs./min.\n\nTDI 65/35 is used exclusively by the polyester PU foam manufacturing process and is delivered in tank truck quantities.  The worst case scenario for TDI 65/35 was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spill of, the contents of the 5,000 gallon storage tank into a concrete containment area designed for tanker trucks. The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in the area of concern which does not affecting public receptors.  This result classifies the polyester PU foam manufacturing process at this facility as a Program Level 1.  The release rate, calculated by the ALOHA model, was 0.0639 lbs./min.\n\nThis facility has it's own HAZWOPER-trained \"HAZMAT\" Team, which will provide initial response to any and all spills, despite the substance or size.  This facility has also arranged for emergency response assistance through a qualified contractor.  If required, the assistance of the Los Angeles County fire department HAZMAT team will be requested.  This facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the local fire department and the local fire department HAZMAT commander.  All employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures, as required by EPA, OSHA and DOT regulations.\n\nThere have been no accidents with regard to spillage of regulated substances at this facility within the last five years."
