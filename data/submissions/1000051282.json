The Montello Terminal is an onshore, light products, bulk petroleum storage terminal used in the storage and distribution of petroleum products to retail and commercial end-users in the vicinity of Reading, PA. The Terminal handles and stores various grades of unleaded gasoline, low-sulfur diesel, pentane, ethanol, and various other petroleum based additives.\n\n\n\nThe facility has fixed inventories of pentane. Pentane is received by truck and stored in one (1) 60,000-gallon storage vessel. Specifically, pentane is off-loaded by truck for storage under pressure (pressure reliefs set at 250 psi on the storage vessel). The pentane is pumped to a blending skid for direct injection into regular and premium unleaded gasoline lines feeding the site gasoline truck-loading rack.  Process safety controls include excess flow valves, low-melting point (<250oF) feeds to pneumatic valves (fail closed), 85% fill shut-off (80% alarm) on the vessel, emergency shutoff devices on the system and video display terminal, line thermal (pressure) reliefs, and grounding/ interlock devices. Access to the Montello Terminal is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, authorized contractors/visitors and tenants.  \n\n\n\nThe Montello Terminal is designed, operated and maintained in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees, contractors and the community in which we operate. We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection. These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning. \n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention programs in place at Montello Terminal. The covered process at the Terminal is regul"

These programs constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the facility. The Montello Terminal complies with the National Fire Protection Association's (NFPA's) Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (NFPA 30 [2012]) requirements for flammable liquid storage. In addition to the presence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of pentane, if a release does occur, an Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) is in place for the Facility and response activities are coordinated with the Western Berks Fire Department and Berks County Department of Emergency Services.\n\n"
