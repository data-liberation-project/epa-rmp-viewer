Title 40, CFR Part 68, requires that Case Farms Chicken will manage the risks involved with the storage, handling, and use of anhydrous ammonia.  To remain compliant, we promote Process Safety Management and Risk Management Planning compliance for the processing plant, our employees and the public.  Overall, these activities prevent accidental injuries, illnesses and environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the Case Farms Chicken Winesburg Plant. We use the refrigerant for keeping the plant processing areas at a constant temperature, preserving product, chilling water, and making ice for use in product shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur safety programs are applied to activities involving anhydrous ammonia including transportation, storage, handling, and use. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe safety policies, procedures, plans and training that we have initiated help prevent accidents and incidents.  The rules are reviewed and improved as needed. They are also communicated to, and accepted by all employees and contractors at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Case Farms is in the process of implementing numerous policies and procedures to enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as other hazardous substances, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. Overall these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid property damage.  Our safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices, which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment. These rules are communicated to and accepted by all employees at our facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 1 of the PSM/RMP Library incorporates several policies. Many policies are included in Vol"

The operating procedures provide all employees involved in the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration process with the written information and precautions necessary to safety perform their tasks in a consistent manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nContractor Qualification Guidelines: This guideline has been established to verify that the contractors working in the facility are qualified to work on the system, trained in the hazards associated with their work, and made aware of the hazards presented by the facility to the employees of the contractor.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of Change and Pre-Startup Safety Review Programs: These programs have been developed to monitor and provide a checks and balances system to monitor changes in the facility and to verify that changes are safe and consistent with company policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity Program: To prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of ammonia, it is important to ensure process equipment is maintained properly.

For information specific to these see the Maintenance Manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 2 incorporates information on the specific system components (Pumps, vessels, compressors, evaporators, evaporative condensers, purgers, piping systems, heat exchangers, the emergency ventilation system, and general safety). This information is used as a reference source for the operator to positively identify system components. Volume 3 incorporates a complete valve list. The valve list contains information on the type, port size, identifying number, use, location, model, manufacturer, drawing reference, and normal operating position of each valve in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso included in Volume 3 is the Process and Instrumentation Diagrams for the individual system components.
