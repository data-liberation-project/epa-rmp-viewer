The storage and processing of milk into cheeses requires the use of Anhydrous Ammonia to provide cooling for various phases of production.  Milk arriving at the facility for processing, as well as cheeses produced must be cooled to maintain quality and product safety.  As a result of this need, the total ammonia charge is over the 10,000-pound threshold and therefore subject to both Process Safety Management PSM and Risk Management Plan RMP requirements.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia while a necessary component of the cheese making industry, poses a threat to employees, contractors, and the public in the event of an uncontrolled release in a significant quantity.  Agropur has recognized the inherent risks involved with the use of anhydrous ammonia and has developed and implemented both a PSM system to protect the onsite employees and a RMP to protect employees, contractors, the public, and the environment in the event of a release.\n\nAgropur's prevention program for ammonia consists of the following elements.\n\u0095\tSafety information for ammonia has been gathered and evaluated to assist Agropur employees in understanding the hazards associated with the process. This information formed a basis for other prevention program elements to minimize the potential for accidental releases.\n\u0095\tA process hazard assessment (PHA) was completed. The purpose of the evaluation was to identify, evaluate and control the hazards of the process.\n\u0095\tWritten standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed so employees and contractors have access to written instructions for the safe operation and maintenance of the ammonia process.\n\u0095\tEmployees at Agropur have been trained, and will continue to be trained, on the job and in the classroom, on aspects of the prevention program and the emergency action plan (EAP).\n\u0095\tA preventive maintenance system has been developed to assure components of the ammonia system are in good working o"

These audits are in addition to the continuous improvement process.\n\u0095\tAgropur will qualify all contractors who work on or adjacent to the refrigeration system.
