The manufacture of these products requires the use of hazardous materials.  As a chemical manufacturer, Blackman Uhler Chemical takes it's responsibility to our employees and our community very seriously.  We accept the responsibility for identifying and managing the risks associated with hazardous chemicals by adhering to company safety, health and environmental policies that require us to make safety, health and environmental considerations a priority in our current operations and our planning and development of new products.  It is also our policy to adhere to all federal, state and local rules and regulations governing the protection of our employees, the community and the environment.\n    Should an emergency involving hazardous materials occur, our emergency response plan is designed to warn and protect both our employees and the community.  This plan has been reviewed with both the local fire department and emergency response planning personnel.\n\n     Blackman Uhler Chemical Co. is a batch processor of organic speciality chemicals.  Our products are used in textile, petroleum, photographic, pharmaceutical, agricultural and fiber products.  In our speciality chemical production we use methyl chloride which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  Methyl chloride is a gas.  It is received at our facility by tank truck and stored in a specially designed storage tank.  The maximum amount of methyl chloride on site is 48,087 pounds.\n\n     The complete failure of the methyl chloride storage tank resulting in the loss of the entire 48,087 pounds of product would be the worst case release scenario for this product at this facility.  Computer modeling of this scenario indicates off site impacts.  An alternate release scenario could occur as a result of the overfilling and resulting overpressurization of the storage tank resulting in the loss of approximately 1918 pound"
