The facility stores cylinders of compressed specialty/industrial gas in both large and small quantities. The cylinders vary from 2000 pounds to less than 1 pound of gas depending on the  of the cylinder and the type of chemical packaged.\n\n\n\nNote:  This October 2013 update of the RMP was prepared to address the addition of new storage processes and the removal of the boron trichloride and chlorine purification processes.  The boron trichloride and chlorine purification processes have been decommissioned and are no longer used at the facility.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nMatheson Tri-Gas is committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the procedures necessary to prevent accidental releases of chemicals. In addition we are committed to developing and maintaining the manpower, the equipment and the emergency response procedures necessary to mitigate a release quickly and effectively if it does occur. Employees and management meet regularly to discuss ongoing operations, potential problems, and continuous improvements to prevent releases from occurring. Trained emergency response personnel will respond immediately to any release or potential release, evaluate the situation, and determine the need to call outside emergency responders.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Chemicals and Processes\n\n\n\nThere are 7 chemicals in 12 processes at the Matheson Tri-Gas Newark facility that are regulated under the Federal RMP Program. The detailed applicability of all inventory levels is listed in the on-site California RMP (Cal-ARP) documentation. The processes regulated by Federal RMP regulations can be summarized as follows:\n\n  \n\nChemical ------ Process\n\n\n\nAmmonia ------ Bldg 7 NH3 Storage\n\nAmmonia ------ Bldg 5 NH3 Storage\n\nAmmonia ------ Area 4 NH3 Storage\n\nArsine "

A state-of-the-art life safety system was installed in late 1999 and early 2000.  This system monitors the presence of various toxic and flammable gases in areas where those gases are stored or processed.  Two-stage alarms are set for each sensor.  The low-level alarm alerts the facility that a problem may be developing.  The high-level alarm provides notification to the Fire Department as well as to the facility.  The system provides real time readouts of gas concentrations and records information that assists in both preventing and mitigating gas releases as well as information that can assist in improving the process.  \n\n\n\nAdherence to objective equipment standards.  One of the most significant contributors to the prevention of accidental releases at this site is the high standards to which all gas cylinders must be manufactured.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) has detailed requirements for manufacturing and testing cylinders. Cylinders must be manufactured according to a particular metallurgical standard and be able to withstand overfilling; an increase in pressure; an increase in temperature and the possibility that they will be hit or fall over.     \n\n\n\nProcess hazard analysis.  Process hazard analyses are performed on relevant processes to determine potential hazards and recommendations for process improvements. \n"

There is a system established for creating and maintaining operating procedures.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive training program that includes classroom and on-the-job training.

All relevant equipment is on a schedule for inspection; inspections are documented and certain equipment is replaced on a regular schedule. \n\n\n\nA thorough accident reporting and investigation program.  The accident/incident reporting and investigation procedure requires the reporting and investigation not only of incidents resulting in injuries, but also incidents that had the potential to result in an injury to an employee or a significant impact on the company's business. \n\n\n\nRestricted access. There are a series of internal and external electronic gates that restrict access into the facility. There are personel on-site 24/7/365 to inspect and safeguard all equipment and storage. Motion detectors and facility cameras are available for recording activity through the plant.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.  The release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\n?    On-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (?68.42(a)); or\n\n?    Known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (?68.42(a)).\"\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's accident history revealed that the facility had one RMP reportable incident in the last five years (October 2008 - October 2013).
