      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for Chemical and Manufacturing Facilities\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Diversified CPC International,Inc are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Blending of Aerosol Propellants.  We have 7 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Propane, Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-], Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] and Pentane.  Propane is used for Aerosol Propellants.  Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] is used for Aerosol Propellants.  Butane is used for Aerosol Propellants.  Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-] is used for Aerosol Propellants.  Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-] is used for Aerosol Propellants.  Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] is used for Aerosol Propellants.  Pentane is used for Aerosol Propellants.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Propane at our facility is 1433240.00 lb. while Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl], Butane, Isopentane  [Butane, 2-methyl-], Difluoroethane  [Ethane, 1,1-difluoro-], Methyl ether  [Methane, oxybis-] and Pentane are present at our facility in quantities of 919640.00 lb., 500000.00 lb., 179000.00 lb., 158000.00 lb., 147890.00 lb. and 41000.00 lb. respectively.\n\n3.

      "SummaryText": " analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Propane.  In this scenario 970600 lb. of Propane is released.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source, with 10 percent of the released quantity participating in a vapor cloud explosion.  Under worst case weather conditions, the calculated distance of 0.80 miles is obtained corresponding to an endpoint of 1 psi overpressure.\n\nOne alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Propane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 111317.89 lb. of Propane in 10 minutes. The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Water Cannons.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.24 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Normal Pentane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 39532.72 lb. of Pentane in 10 minutes.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Water Cannons.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the flammable endpoint of 1 psi overpressure is 0.18 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 flammable substances involves a release from Isobutane.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  The scenario involves the release of 48765.28 lb. of Isobutane  [Propane, 2-methyl] in 10 minutes.  The release is controlled by active mitigation measures that include Water Cannons.  Under neutral weathe"
