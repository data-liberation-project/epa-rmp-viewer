It\r\nis our policy to implement the appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\r\nsubstances. We also coordinate our response efforts with the local Fire Department, Law\r\nEnforcement, and Emergency Medical Services, all which provide additional emergency response\r\ninformation and expertise.\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:\r\nOur facility's primary activities include support services for agricultural crop production. We have\r\nanhydrous ammonia stored at our facility, in both a primary holding tank(s), as well as supplemental\r\nnurse tanks, which are used for product field application. All of our tanks are filled by skilled, trained\r\nemployees who do not fill any tank beyond the 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n3.
