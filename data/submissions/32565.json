Upon notification the agencies can activate the community alert systems as necessary. The systems are tested on a regular basis.\n\nFixed fire suppression systems consisting of fire water pumps, fire hydrants and hydrant/monitor assemblies, water deluge systems, and foam blanket systems on specific storage vessels help protect the facility in the event of fire. Additionally, there are fire hose houses which contain fire hose, fire water nozzles, and various wrenches and adapters that provide mobile fire fighting capability. The site also has a fire truck and foam trailer which can be utilized by the emergency response team members. Additional fire water capacity can be accessed through a neighboring industry's fire water system as needed and/or required.\n\nFor hazardous materials incidents a supply of emergency equipment is kept on-hand, including protective clothing, fresh air systems, capping kits, absorbent pads, leak dams, etc.  For incidents requiring external assistance, manpower is provided by the Baton Rouge Fire Department. The facility can also use the services of contract leak mitigation services as required.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nThe facility has had no releases in the last 5 years which require RMP reporting within the criteria specified by the Risk Management rule. \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\n\nThe facility operates under a credo of continuous improvement.

Quench vapor and liquid is fed to the HCl distillation column where anhydrous HCl is removed from the Column overhead.  EDC and VCM from the HCl column bottoms is then feed to the VCM distillation column.  Recycle EDC from the bottom of the VCM column is reacted with chlorine to remove chloroprene and then stored in the Recycle EDC Storage Tank.  Product VCM from the overhead of the VCM column is further purified in the HCl Stripping Column before being sent to the storage spheres.  VCM stored in the spheres is transferred to PVC and also loaded in rail tank cars.  \n\nAnhydrous HCL removed in the HCl Column is stored in the HCl Storage Sphere and fed to three Oxychlorination reactors.  It is reacted in the presence of oxygen, ethylene and a catalyst to produce EDC and water.  The heat of reaction is removed and the reactor temperature controlled by series of exchanger tubes which pass through the reactor.  The steam produced is fed to the VCM low pressure steam header.  The Oxychlorination Reactor product is quenched with condensed liquor.  The condensed EDC and water from the quench operation are then separated.  The EDC contaminated water is sent to the process waste water storage tanks.  Unreacted components are further cooled to remove EDC and unreacted products plus inerts are recycled back to the reactor.  A purge stream of non-condensable gases is vented to the incinerator to control reactor pressure.\n\nThe EDC Purification section purifies EDC before it is fed to the cracking furnaces.

The Heavy Ends Column removes components heavier than EDC.  The bottom product of this column is further purified in the Tar Stills and EDC Recovery Column to recover EDC and lower the concentration before it is disposed of as Heavy Ends Waste.  The Heavy Ends is stored in tanks and removed from the plant site via tank trucks.  Lights and inerts which are removed, by pressure control, in the Light Ends, EDC Recovery Columns, and Heavy Ends Columns are fed to the Incinerators through the vent system.  All purified EDC from this section is stored in the Pure EDC Storage Tank. Water removed in the Light Ends Columns, produced in the Oxychlorination reactors and from other sources throughout the plant that are contaminated with EDC are contained by the process waste water collection system in storage tanks.  These tanks are used to store and separate the EDC from the waste water.  The EDC recovered is pumped to the West Crude EDC Tank.  The waste water is pumped to the waste water strippers where the EDC is steam stripped from the waste stream.\n\nThe VCM unit has two incinerators which receive vents continuously from the columns and reactors in the plant.  Additionally, the incinerators receive waste gases from decontamination of vessels in VCM and PVC unit.  Under normal conditions one incinerator is sufficient for the waste gas vents.  The other incinerator remains in service but at a reduced temperature.  The effluent from the incinerators is cooled in a waste heat boiler.  HCl in the boiler effluent is recovered in absorber tower in the form of 10 % acid.

The plant currently produces six grades of suspension PVC, with the ability to manufacture three grades at once.  \n\nThe PVC polymerization reactors consist of  large jacketed vessels with agitators, reflux condensers and related equipment.  The production of a single batch of PVC consists of mixing measured quantities of water (for ease of material transport and better product quality), suspending agents (to allow the water and PVC to form a uniform mixture), other chemical additives (for better product quality), and VCM (the raw material).  After these ingredients are mixed, an initiator is added to start the polymerization reaction.  The polymerization reaction is exothermic.  The reaction process is cooled to maintain a desired process temperature. Once 80 to 90% of the VCM is reacted, the reaction is stopped through the addition of an inhibitor chemical.  The unreacted VCM gas is removed from the reaction vessel and then  purified to be reused in future batches.  The resulting mixture is a slurry of 30 to 35% by volume of PVC in water, which is pumped through filters to blowdown holding tanks.\n\nThe PVC slurry is piped to the VCM Steam stripping column where as much unreacted VCM is removed as is possible. The stripping column operates under a slight vacuum for better separation.  After stripping, the PVC slurry contains less than permitted 35 ppm VCM.  The stripped VCM is vented to a gas holder to be purified for reuse. \n\nThe PVC slurry is pumped through coolers to dryer feed the holding tanks.
