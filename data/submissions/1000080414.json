      "SummaryText": "Primus Pipe and Tube Inc.(Primus) operateS a stainless steel pipe and tube manufacturing facility on approximately 160 acres of owned property in Wildwood, Florida. The facility is situated in the Northeastern portion of Sumter County. The facility consists of two main manufacturing buildings whIch are used for pipe forming and welding activities, a covered and contained pickling building and a wastewater treatment plant. In 2019, a new production plant will be added to the facility. Construction is anticipated to be complete in November, 2019.\n\n\n\nPrimus manufactures pipe diameters of 2.375\" OD through 6.625\" OD and 1\" through 4\" square tubing in the South Plant. The North plant produces 8.625\" OD through 84.000\"OD with wall thickness ranging from 0.188\" through 2.375\". The pipe is formed from both coil stock and plate. The activities involved in manufacturing pipe include forming, welding, annealing with water quench, sizing, straightening and cutting to length. Final cleaning of maunfactured pipe with pickling acid and inspection follow the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\nThe acid pickling process uses a substance regulated under section 112 (r)(7) of the clean air act. The substance is Hydrofluoric Acid @ 70% concentration. The hydrofluoric acid is used in the pickling process to remove oxides from the surface of annealed pipe. At any one time, this substance may be stored in a quantity above the threshold quantity listed in 40 CFR 96, Subpart F.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release program in place at Primus consists of the elements required by the EPA Risk Management Program, a site specific Emergency Response Plan and a weekly scheduled inspection procedure. Primus is committed to preventing accidental releases by providing and maintaining the highest practically achievable standards of occupational health, safety and workplace environment. Primus' goal is to discover, correct and address conditions which may result in personal illness, injury, offsite consequences or property"

      "SummaryText": " damage. Health, safety, protection of the environment and surrounding property have equal status with other primary business objectives, and are an integral part of planning and implementing every aspect of the companies operations. In addition, Primus adheres to all applicable OSHA, FDEP and EPA regulations and continually reviews the regulations for any applicable changes or additions to the rules. Primus also has an ISO14001:2004 and an OSHAS18001 plan in place and has received official certification for the plan. This plan places additional requirements above and beyond regulatory requirements for Company environmental and safety performance. This plan requires additional procedures for inspection, maintenance and record keeping. The plan also requires constant auditing of the systems from both internal and external sources.\n\n\n\nHealth, safety and the protection of the environment and surrounding areas are the direct responsibility of OSPI management. Management and supervision take initiative as an intigral part of their duties to ensure that safe working procedures and practices are employed to eliminate the risks of accidents and health hazards. A continual alertness to identify and correct unsafe work practices or hazardous work conditions is paramount. Information and training is provided to maintain an awareness of safety and the working environment.\n\n\n\nPrimus is a non-responding facility. Personnel will respond to incidents in the insipient stage and within the limitations of operator training and the limitations of the facilities personal protective gear. Incidents which cannot be brought under control through operators procedures will be handled by Sumter County Fire Rescue and HazMat Team. The Emergency Coordinator receives annual RCRA and HAZWOPPER training to supervise the facilities response. The Supplier of Hydrofluoric acid conducts refresher training to pertinent facility on a periodic basis. Up-dated copies of the ERP are provided to the LEPC, S"

      "SummaryText": "ERC, FDEP,  Sumter County Fire Rescue, Sumter County Sheriffs Office, Wildwood Police Department, Leesburg Regional Medical Center and Munroe Regional Medical Center. The Sumter County Fire Rescue and HAZMAT Team are brought on site periodically to review Primus' ERP and to become visually familiar with the tank locations and plant surroundings.\n\n\n\nProcess controls for the hydrofluoric acid system include vents, monitors, scrubbers, sprinklers, and antisiphon valves, a diluge system and supplied air for respirators. The steel acid tank was replaced by a doubled walled poly tank making annual ultrasonic wall thickness testing obsolete. Monthly inspections of the storage vessel and associated pumps, piping and valves identify any safety or environmental hazards quickly and further reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. The storage system sits in a 22,000 gallon containment pit which is more than sufficient to contain the entire contents of the tank and enough water to reduce the concentration below fuming levels. There will also be room for a hydrated lime addition to raise the pH prior to pumping to the wastewater treatment plant for final treatment and disposal. Primus has awarded a contract to replace the current HF tank in the fall of 2019. \n\n\n\nThere have been no incidents with Hydrofluoric acid within the last five years. The systems in use have proven to be effective in the past and will be kept in a continuous state of improvement. OSPI will continue to improve safety by; Holding employee safety meetings, continuously inspecting and correcting findings through a corrective action program, maintaining an active Safety Committee, and conducting updated training as needed."
