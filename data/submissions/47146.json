These two toxics are addressed in our facility emergency action plan. \r\nIn addition, the hydrogen sulfide gas is covered under the New Mexico Rule 118, \r\nof which we comply, that deals with the protection of the general public.  This \r\nfacility does not have a threshold planning quantity of any toxic; therefore, a \r\nworst-case scenario (WCS) for a toxic release was not evaluated.  \r\n\r\nThe WCS associated with a release of flammable substances at the gas plant is \r\na vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the product storage \r\ntank containing a mixture of ethane, propane and butane.  \r\n\t\r\nThe maximum distance to the 1-psi endpoint for this WCS is 0.60 mile(s).   The \r\nWCS for the other two regulated processes would result in a 1psi endpoint of \r\n0.40 miles.  Although we have numerous controls to prevent such releases and to manage \r\ntheir consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into \r\naccount in evaluating this WCS. There is only Program Level 1 processes, \r\ncontaining regulated flammable substances, identified at our gas plant. \r\n\t\r\nThe Jal #3 gas plant maintains a written emergency action program, which is in \r\nplace to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The \r\nprogram consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated \r\nsubstance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance \r\n\r\nis accidentally released. This includes names and telephone numbers of contact \r\npersons for SUGS, for surrounding public receptors, for emergency \r\nresponders, and for affected agencies.

(SUGS) is a publicly held company that \r\nhas been in the gas processing business for more than 50 years.  SUGS operate \r\nnatural gas processing plants in Southeast New Mexico and West Texas.    The \r\nJal # 3 Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This \r\ncommitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, \r\nsuch as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, \r\noperation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement \r\nreasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  \r\nHowever, if a release does occur, gas plant trained personnel will respond to \r\ncontrol and contain the release.  \r\n\t\r\nThis facility gathers raw field natural gas for processing.  The facility and system \r\nof pipelines is jurisdictional to the Environmental Protection Agency, New Mexico \r\nOil Conservation Division, New Mexico Environmental Department, New Mexico \r\nWater Quality Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the \r\nUnited States Department of Transportation.  These agencies conduct periodic \r\nfacility inspections and report any findings to SUGS corporate management.\r\n\r\nOver the past 5 years there have not been any incidents that resulted in, or \r\nreasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major \r\nproperty damage, environmental loss, or personal injury at this facility. The Jal #3 \r\nPlant has an excellent record of accident prevention.  \r\n\t\r\nThe Jal #3 Plant is located northeast of Jal, New Mexico in Lea County.
