HCC is extremely diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is very diligent about the safety of its employees and the neighboring Community.  HCC staff is highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor its facility to provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using anhydrous ammonia for pollution control.  Ammonia plays a key role in nearly eliminating potentially harmful pollutants from the HCC Wilmington Plant turbine exhaust.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe HCC Wilmington Plant has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the Wilmington Plant processes.  HCC's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nThe Wilmington Plant has been designated by the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and is identified in the Business Emergency Plan as a \"non-responding facility,\" and an Emergency Response Plan is not required.  However, to address the above objectives, on a proactive basis, a detailed Emergency Action Plan has been created and is maintained to support the Wilmington Plant's responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of emergency response (i.e., coordination of the response activities between on-site response capabilities and municipal emergency response capabilities).  The emergency pre-planning and responses identified in the Emergency Action Plan are for the purpose of supporting the overall effectiveness of the municipa"

Various reviews and updates have occurred throughout the life of the facility as part of Harbor Cogeneration Company's diligent interest in the protection of personnel and the Community, as well as regulatory requirements such as PSM and RMPP.  The July 30, 2012 Emergency Action Plan represents an evolution of previous revisions, is complete, is current, and meets or exceeds key regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nKey elements of the Emergency Action Plan include:\n\n\n\n - Identification of emergency duties\n\n - Clear identification of emergency goals and objectives \n\n - An Emergency Action Guide\n\n - Key phone numbers and contact points for Municipal and Mutual Aid Emergency Response\n\n - Incident Command System (ICS) definition\n\n - Vicinity maps with emergency mitigation equipment identified\n\n - Detailed task-by-task plans for:\n\n     - Injury and Illness\n\n     - Natural Disasters (Earthquake)\n\n     - Bomb Threat\n\n     - Fire\n\n     - Off-Site Emergency \n\n     - Hazardous Material Release (e.g., ammonia, sulfuric acid/caustic soda, other materials)\n\n     - Civil Disturbance\n\n     - Intrusion\n\n\n\nAs a \"non-responding facility,\" the Wilmington Plant does not have a designated emergency response team; however, Los Angeles City Fire Department specialists are trained and fully equipped to respond to hazardous material releases.

This Plan will be reviewed and updated at least once per year to ensure compliance with PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nAlthough at the time of this CalARP/RMP Submittal, the oil field is shut-in, the Harbor Cogeneration Company Wilmington Plant was designed to support thermally enhanced oil recovery operations by cogenerating electricity and steam, using natural gas and refinery gas to fire a turbine and other auxiliary equipment.  Electricity is supplied to the utility grid, and steam production is currently used to operate two steam turbine generators for production of electricity. \n\n\n\nThe exhaust gas from the cogeneration unit contains oxides of nitrogen (Nox).  The emissions are reduced to authorized levels by mixing the turbine exhaust gas with small amounts of ammonia and passing them over a catalyst.  The Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process involves Nox and ammonia (NH3) reacting to form nitrogen (N2) and water vapor (H2O).  Thus, the primary purpose of the ammonia is to contribute to the reduction of air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored on-site in a 15,000 gallon pressurized storage vessel (22' 6\" long by 10' 0\" diameter).  Ammonia vapor is withdrawn from the top of the vessel at a possible maximum rate of ~84 lb/hr.  It is then mixed with air and diluted to a concentration of less than 2% by volume before being fed into the turbine exhaust and then over the catalyst.  A small electric vaporizer adjace"

The storage vessel is designed for a pressure of 265 psig at 250F, well in excess of the normal operating pressure and temperature.\n\n\n\nWhen the plant is continuously operating (24 hours x 365 days)  the storage vessel is filled 12 times per year via delivery truck. When the plant is operating intermittently as a cycling/peaking facility, the storage vessel is filled 3 times per year.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment Summary\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: Release of the maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored in the largest equipment item (the Ammonia Storage Vessel) - 65,663 pounds in 10 minutes.  Although there are numerous controls to prevent such a release and to manage its consequences, the Ammonia Storage Vessel is located outside, and no credit for administrative controls or passive mitigation features was taken for the worst-case release scenario.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used, as specified by regulation.  The EPA RMP*Comp Dispersion Modeling software was used to determine the maximum downwind endpoint distance to 200 ppm.  The result shows that off-site areas may be affected.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\n\nScenario Description: A release of anhydrous ammonia liquid as a result of a gasket rupture (0.0243 sq. in.) for 60 minutes.  For this alternative release scenario, the release rate of ammonia calculated to be 49.39 pounds per minute.  Since water deluge and firewater monitors can be readily applied to any potential accidental release of ammonia, the resultant endpoint distance would be expected to be limited to within the perimeter of the Wilmington Plant.  Therefore, these practical, active mitigation features are not credited. \n\n\n\nThe meteorological conditions specified by regulation for alternative release scenarios were used (3.0 m/s wind speed; atmospheric"

The downwind distance for this alternative release scenario is significantly less than that for the worst-case scenario.  Although off-site areas may also be affected for this alternative release scenario, the maximum endpoint distance for this alternative release scenario is just beyond the Harbor Cogeneration Company perimeter.\n\n\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the Community; the Harbor Cogeneration Company Wilmington Plant has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make this type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the Company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion analyses appear worse than what would actually be expected during such an event (e.g., In the event of a release, sudden rupture and flashing of ammonia would be highly turbulent.  Turbulence causes entrainment of air and the released vapor dilutes much more quickly).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the use of conservative analysis assumptions that overpredict the effects of a potential release, other characteristics of the facility and site serve to minimize the potential risks associated with an ammonia release:\n\n - The HCC Wilmington Plant site is in a large industrial complex and relatively distant from populated neighborhoods or other potentially sensitive receptors.\n\n - The prevalent wind direction is not directly toward any potentially sensitive receptors.\n\n - The Ammonia Storage Vessel makes use of excess flow valves to minimize the amount of a potential release.\n\n - Firewater systems, firewater monitors, and Ammonia Storage"
