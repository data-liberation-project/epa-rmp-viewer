This will allow for 3 one-ton cylinders to be in-service, 3 one-ton cylinders on stand-by and 3 one-ton cylinders in reserve.\n\nTo ensure compliance with the RMP Rule, an accidental release prevention program has been established.  This will include: training for operators and maintenance personnel, effective standard operating procedures, preventative maintenance, a hazard review, and a review of the necessity for new storage and safety equipment.  Training in the use of the on-site self-contained breathing apparatus will continue to ensure all operational personnel are practiced in its use.  In conjunction with various operations and maintenance personnel a standard operating procedure was established and will be elaborated on in the O&M manual.  A preventative maintenance program has been completed with an update to tank mounted vacuum regulators  and inspection of all related equipment.  \n\nThe chemical-specific prevention steps include: air purifying respirators to be used when changing chlorine cylinders, awareness of toxic and hazardous properties of chlorine, the use of vacuum operating equipment, and the presence of chlorine detection monitors.  \n\nThe Scranton Sewer Authority has the required Emergency Response Plan coordinated with the Lackawanna County LEPC.  This plan gives details on emergency contacts, potentially affected areas, and other information regarding the wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes both the \"worst-case release scenario\" and the \"alternative release scenario\".  The worst-case release scenario for an accidental release of chlorine is the catostrophic failure of a one-ton cylinder.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA is 3 parts per million based on the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines.

      "SummaryText": "ence Tables and Equations, a distance to toxic endpoint was 1.3 miles and the residential population potentially affected was 9,400.  The alternate-case release scenario is a major leak more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario.  Pipe failure was identified as most likely scenario.  When the atmospheric dispersion model was used for the alternate-case scenario, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles and a residential population potentially affected of zero was obtained.  The building that houses the chlorine cylinders was considered as a passive mitigation system.  Other mitigation measures in use are: chlorine monitors and vacuum piping.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.  Improvements and procedural changes brought about by investigation and preparation for the RMP are as follows:  documentation of standard operating procedures for chlorine cylinder replacement, development of a Emergency Action Plan, initiating a preventative maintenance plan,  increased training, installation of automatic emergency shut-offs, plans to increase  and mitigation systems for chlorine cylinders, and investigation into active mitigation systems, including an onsite scrubber.\n"
