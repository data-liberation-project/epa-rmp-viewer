(CREH) is strongly committed to employee and  public safety, as well as\r\nsound environmental practices.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release\r\nprevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and\r\nemployee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate\r\ncontrols to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\r\n\r\n2.

Administrative controls considered in the analysis\r\ninclude inventory limitations for storage vessels based upon high level alarms and shut-downs to ensure\r\nadequate \"head space\".

The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps Our\r\nfacility has taken all steps necessary to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out\r\nunder 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.\r\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at\r\nCREH. These elements are the basis for Process Safety Management system as required under 29 CFR\r\n1910.119 / CalOSHA \u00a7 5189.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nCREH maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the hazards of the chemicals used in\r\nthe processes, information regarding the technology of the process (process chemistry, process flow\r\ndiagrams, safe upper and lower limits for process parameters, etc.), and detailed equipment information\r\n(materials of construction, piping and instrument  diagrams, design codes and standards, safety systems,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nCREH conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with processes are identified and\r\nappropriately managed. The primary methodology used to conduct these analyses is Hazard And Operability\r\n(HAZOP) studies.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering\r\nand process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  Findings related to the hazard\r\nanalysis are addressed in a timely manner based on relative risk of potential hazards.\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nFor the purpose of safely conducting activities within covered processes, OEHI maintains written operating\r\nprocedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations,\r\ntemporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a\r\nturnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nCREH has"

These activities are conducted by the Mechanical Integrity group and\r\nMaintenance persons.  Only qualified personnel are permitted to carry out inspections, tests, and\r\nmaintenance activities on process equipment and systems such as pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping\r\nsystems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, pumps, compressors and electrical\r\nequipment. Specialized training is provided as needed for certain maintenance checks.
