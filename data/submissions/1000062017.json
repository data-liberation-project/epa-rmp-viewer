The commitments are\n\ndocumented in the company safety policies and procedures. Zeco management stresses\n\nsafe operations in employee training programs which include refresher training and updates to \n\nany changes made in Zeco's operations manual, and any changes made in the industry.\n\n\n\nDescription of Process\n\nZeco Inc. stores sanitation, soaps and intervention chemicals used in the food safety industry.\n\nThese chemicals are used throughout the industry for many different applications such as general \n\ncleaning of equipment and bacterial intervention. Intervention involves the use of Peracetic acid \n\napplied to protein carcass to eliminate bacteria and other pathogens that could potentially cause harm to the public.\n\n\n\nPeracetic acid is delivered by tractor-trailer in individual vented IBC totes and L99 HMWPE Resin drums to the Cummings \n\nRoad warehouse. Product is off loaded by forklift and stored in an isolated part of the warehouse in an separate internal building, away from the main tote \n\nand drum storage areas, that are awaiting purchase, pickup and delivery.  The enclosed PAA storage area is climate controlled and \n\nmonitored by both PAA sensors and a fire protection system. \n\nThe process is a basic inbound delivery with staging of the product and then re-loading for outbound deliveries to the customer.\n\n\n\nZeco uses trained fork lift operators to move the product throughout the process. The product\n\ncontainers are not opened for any reason. Zeco employees do participate in emergency response actions and have been trained to do so. \n\nZeco has spill kits available at all times and all employees go through class room training, followed by a spill demonstration. \n\nZeco installed new technology,called a Steri-trac system for monitoring the PPM in the air to alert employees of a p"

Also, the\n\nemployees will notify the local fire department and call Safety Kleen to aid with the spill clean-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAn accidental release of the total amount of Peracetic Acid stored is believed to be unlikely due to the individual \n\nisolated storage methods used. Potential total release would be in the event ofnatural disaster, fire, or structural collapse. \n\nThe calculated endpoint is .6 miles with public receptors within the distance to the endpoint. The facility contains a 24 hour \n\nmonitored fire alarm system in which the Chattanooga Tennessee Fire Department would respond in case of emergency.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release\n\nPotential release of Peracetic Acid is determined to be by fork truck operator error by means of\n\npuncturing the product container with the forks. Estimation of the forks entering\n\nthe lowest point of the container, with a release rate of 368 lbs./min at release duration of 5 minutes was calculated. In the event of such release, all employees are instructed on how to contain such leak and call Safety Kleen to provide support if needed. The local fire department will also be\n\ncontacted.\n\n\n\nMaintenance\n\nPre-shift inspections are performed by the fork truck operator. Any deficiency is noted and put on schedule for repair. If any deficiency is found to compromise the safe operation of the unit, the unit is placed out of service and scheduled for repair. It is not permissible to alter or disable any safety feature placed on the unit by the manufacturer. Material KENCO of Chattanooga TN is contracted to perform maintenance and repairs on the fork trucks keeping the units safe to operate.  SteriTrack monitoring system sensors a"
