If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire company or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the people and the environment.  The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and transferred for use as a crop production nutrient.\n\nThe maximum quantity that would be handled would be the 144,177# in our 3-11,000 gallon storage tanks. We can also hold a total of 87,380 pounds in rolling stock for a total capacity of  231,557#.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternate case scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  Local responders will be made aware of the necessary information.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.111.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture inspects our plants on an annual basis.  We also meet all insurance underwriting guidelines and have annual loss control surveys, which focus on storage and operating/safety processes.  NOTE: The Kansas Department of Ag has not adopted the most recent version of the ANSI standard.  This company recognizes the importance of staying current with the standard and as budget allows we will budget time and money accordingly to bring all facilities up to the current standard.\n\nOur firm has a good safety record at this location.  In the past five years we have had no one reportable accidents that was do to faulty equipment and caused one minor exposure.  The employee was treated as a precaution.  \n\nWe consider training to be our greatest administrative control.  We rotate our employees on a three-year basis and send them to NH3 sch"

We have implemented Standard Operating Procedures that are written down for the benefit of our new employees, as well as Standard Maintenance Procedures.  \n\nOur firm has a detailed emergency action plan, which OSHA requires. As required by 29CFR1910.120(P)(8) the Emergency Response Plan is not needed.  Our employees are trained to evacuate the area should an emergency release occur.  Employees are trained on basic first aid for victims, where to evacuate too, and how to notify first responders.   \n\nWe report to the county, state and local fire department chemical inventories and locations as required by The Community Right-to-Know\" rules and regulations.  \n\nSafety improvements are an ongoing process at our firm.  We are dedicated to safely serving our customers and protecting the employees that work for us.  Training, equipment and maintenance are of the highest quality and design.  We order all parts from an industry specialist to insure that they are approved parts for the process.  At this time there are no specific upgrades planned.  We are proud of our efforts and proud to serve the communities in which we operate.\n\nThere are planned improvements at this facility including emergency shut off valves."
