      "SummaryText": "Farmers Union Oil Co. of Bridgewater, SD is a registered Anhydrous Ammonia dealer. We own a 18,000 gallon stationary storage tank located on our property on the west edge of Bridgewater. In this tank we store anhydrous ammonia for agricultural us by our patrons.\nWe have not had an accident release of anhydrous ammonia in the last 10 years. This can be attributed to our Accident Release Prevention Program. We train our employees in the safe transfer of annhydrous ammonia and also in the preventive maintance of our equipment. In addition to this, our facilities are inspected yearly by our insurance carrier and by the South Dakota Dept. of Agriculture. Any deficiencies, found by these inspections or our employees, are corrected immediately.\nOur Risk Management Plan was completed using government and industry standards for accidental release and the alternative release scenarios. We have an Emergency Action Plan in force coordinated with the Bridgewater Fire Department and the Local Emergency Action Plan Committee in conjunction with the McCook County Civil Defense in Salem, SD.\nWe are constantly looking at changes in technology in the transfer and storage of anhydrous ammonia and upgrade our facilities when they come to the market."
