STS Intermodal is committed to operating the facility in a manner that minimizes or eliminates accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. Safe work practices, training of our personnel, and implementation of spill prevention measures are utilized at STS.  STS has also implemented a Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures (HMCPEP) which includes notification of the local fire authority and implementation of hazardous materials cleanup by an outside contractor so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases if and when they occur.\r\n\r\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68). The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the rules.\r\n\r\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled:\r\n\r\nThe facility is located at 3601 NW Marine Drive, Troutdale, Oregon (see Figure 1 - Site Location Map).  The facility is located in Multnomah County, in Section 22 of Township 1 North, Range 3 East, on Tax Lots 400 and 500.  STS leases the property (approximately 6 acres) from Parenti Properties LLC.  The site is situated in an area zoned for General Industrial (GI).  It is bounded to the north by Salmon Creek and vacant fields, to the east by vegetation and Swift Transportation, to the south by vegetation, Arata Creek and G&R Auto Wreckers, and to the west by a truck yard.\r\n\r\nThe 6-acre subject facility includes 9,120 square feet of covered industrial and office space.  The site contains one main structure with an attached covered storage on the north exterior and a separate covered storage structure further to the northeast. Remaining areas of t"

Hazardous materials are stored indoors, outdoors under cover, and in exposed outdoor areas.  STS does not generate hazardous waste onsite. \r\n\r\nSTS Intermodal has three regulated substances which require RMP regulation.  These were all under the toxics classification.

Depending on the scope and scale of the spill, STS may engage the services of a spill response contractor.\r\nThe EC has the authority to commit the necessary corporate resources, including services and equipment, to control the spill or release. In addition, the EC has access to reference material and facility Safety Data Sheets (SDS).
