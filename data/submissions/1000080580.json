All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances. This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and action procedures.\n\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\n\nRise Baking Company, located on Miller Road in Dallas, TX, is a bakery and cold storage facility. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling.  In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Rise Baking Company has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n3.\tWorst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Rise Baking Company facility.\n\n4.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\nThe Dallas TX, - Miller Road Facility has an emergency plan that addresses the actions necessary in the event of a release of ammonia from the refrigeration system. Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected. The compressor room is provided with ammonia detectors and visual alarms. The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves. Further, refrigeration system operators and contractors have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.\tIn case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Dallas Fire Department and the appropriate agencies to assi"
