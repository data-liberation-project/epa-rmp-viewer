Pie Hay Filter Plant involves the use of chlorine for disinfection purposes in order to provide safe drinking water to the City of Lexington and surrounding communities. Chlorine in its gaseous form is mixed with treated water to form a chlorine solution that is added during the treatment process.\r\n\r\nChlorine is listed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a regulated toxic substance. Facilities that handle amounts of chlorine over 2,500 pounds are required by the EPA to develop a Risk Management Program (RMP) to reduce the risk to employees and the public of injury from an accidental release of chlorine. The L.T. Pie Hay Filter Plant stores 4,000 pounds (two 1-ton containers) of chlorine and is therefore required to submit an RMP.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nThe policy of the City of Lexington is that the operation of all chlorine equipment will be by trained and knowledgeable personnel only. Therefore, personnel at the filter plant are required to attend all training as specified in the RMP. The emergency response policy involves providing emergency awareness level training to employees and the cooperation of the facility with the local emergency response agencies. \r\n\r\nOff-Site Consequence Analyses\r\n\r\nRMP regulations require the analysis of a worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario to determine the area that could potentially be affected by a chlorine release. The EPA defines the worst-case release scenario as \u00bfthe greatest amount held in a single vessel \u00bf released as a gas over 10 minutes\u00bf. This scenario is highly unlikely, but is used as the basis for the analysis of potential risk involved with the use of regulated chemicals and in the development of the risk management program. The alternative release scenario involves a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario.\r\nA c"

      "SummaryText": "omputer model provided by the EPA was used to estimate the distance that chlorine could travel and still have an impact on the public and the environment. This model utilizes the parameters required by the regulations, such as specific atmospheric conditions. In addition, the model was run using a release in enclosed space, in direct contact with outside air. This parameter reduces the rate of release to 55% of the rate of a release happening outdoors.\r\n\r\nThe worst-case scenario for chlorine analyzed the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine over a 10 minute period. The model calculated that this worst-case release could potentially affect the public and the environment within a 0.9 mile radius of the filter plant.\r\n\r\nFor the alternative release scenario, the situation of a leak occurring while connecting a full container was analyzed. The operating steps for this procedure include opening the chlorine container valve slightly, re-closing it immediately and testing for chlorine leaks. Therefore, any leak will be detected and the problem corrected before placing the container in service. The model calculated that under this scenario, the chlorine would travel less than 0.10 mile. This is the minimum distance the model will provide.\r\n \r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nThe L.T. Pie Hay Filter Plant has developed an accidental release prevention program based on the EPA Risk Management Program and OSHA Process Safety Management regulations that includes the following:\r\n  \r\n  Operating procedures to ensure safe operation of the chlorine equipment \r\n  Annual operator training regarding the hazards of chlorine, operating procedures, and emergency procedures\r\n  Routine maintenance to prevent mechanical failure\r\n  Leak detector to minimize the effects of an accidental chemical release\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nNo reportable accidents have occurred in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe L.T.
