These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.  \n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Apex Propane Terminal has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the facility.  New employees receive basic training in equipment and process flows,refrigeration sytem operation and LPG truck loading procedures.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to insure that"

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.  \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Apex Propane Terminal located in Wake County, North Carolina is owned by Enterprise Products Operating LLC and is operated by Enterprise Propane Terminals and Storage, LLC.\n\nThe Apex terminal engages in the pipeline receipt and storage of liquefied propane, the receipt and storage of ethyl mercaptan, and loading of propane tank trucks.  The stored ethyl mercaptan in injected into the propane loaded into the trucks for the purpose of LPG odorization as an aid to leak detection.  The facility consists of one refrigerated propane storage tank, ten propane pressure storage tanks, a six-station truck loading rack, mercaptan storage and injection equipment, a propane refrigeration system and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nThe Apex terminal has several systems in place to prevent an accidental release of pressurized liquid propane, including continuous remote monitoring of flows, pressures and levels in the facility control office and from the Dixie Pipeline control center.  The ethyl mercaptan storage tanks are filled manually by on site personnel monitoring the storage tank levels and pressure to prevent over-filling.   In addition, there are various alarms and s"

There are also pressure relief valves and rupture disks in place to protect the storage vessels and process piping..\n\nThe Apex Propane Terminal facility was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on the known volumes of the storage tanks.  The only listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantity at the Apex Propane Terminal facility are propane and ethyl mercaptan.  The propane terminal facility is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Apex Propane Terminal.  The storage and loading operations at the propane terminal facility are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation, and are also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the Propane terminal facility's PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.

Employees receive training in the emergency procedures, and they are updated when necessary based on modifications made to the Propane Terminal facility.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program is coordinated with the Wake County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings with the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Apex Propane Terminal has instituted necessary around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and local emergency responders (e.g. fire department).  This will provide a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to the planned periodic LEPC meetings, the Apex Propane Terminal conducts periodic reviews of emergency procedures with the fire department emergency response organization.  The Apex Propane Terminal facility also currently provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of the regulated substances handled by the propane terminal.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Apex Propane Terminal facility resolves all findings from PHA's, some of which result in modifications to the process.

All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the propane terminal facility has procedures in place to insure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform Propane terminal facility personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, the Apex Propane Terminal facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel will periodically monitor contractor performance to insure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.  \n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Apex Propane terminal facility conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to insure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field ver"

Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.  Considering the design and operations that take place at the Apex Propane Storage and Terminal facility, changes that require the use of the management of change program have been and are expected to occur infrequently.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Apex Propane Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help insure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  Both hourly and staff personnel participate as audit team members.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to Propane Terminal facility management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team\u00c2\u00bfs findings are tracked until they are resolved and completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the"
