Liquid fluorine is produced for internal consumption only; all other chemicals produced are sold to offsite customers.  The facility operates continuously to produce these chemicals.  In the production process, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of an accidental release.\n\n? Anhydrous Hydrogen Fluoride\nAnhydrous hydrogen fluoride is stored in the tank farm in three storage vessels.  Additionally, a tank car may be on site for unloading purposes.  Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used in the manufacture of fluorine and the conversion of uranium dioxide to uranium tetrafluoride.\n ? Anhydrous Ammonia\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored in tank farm facilities in two storage vessels.  Additionally, a tank car may be on site for unloading purposes.  Ammonia is used for the production of hydrogen gas, which is consumed on site for the reduction of uranium ore concentrates to uranium dioxide.\n\n? Liquid Fluorine\nLiquid fluorine is produced on site and stored in four insulated storage vessels.  The vessels are cooled with liquid nitrogen contained within the jacket that surrounds the vessel.

These elements are part of Occupational Safety and Health Act - Process Safety Management Regulations (OSHA 1910.119).  The general accident prevention elements are as follows.\n\n? Process Safety Information\n? Process Hazard Analysis\n? Operating Procedures\n? Training\n? Mechanical Integrity\n? Management of Change\n? Pre-Startup Review\n? Compliance Audits\n? Incident Investigation\n? Employee Participation\n? Hot Work Permits\n? Contractors\n\nThe Metropolis Works uses its Management of Change (MOC) process to assure plant compliance with many of the elements of OSHA 1910.119.  Any plant process change requires the written approval of Safety, Occupational Health, Environmental, Production and Maintenance organizations including upper management.  During the MOC review of a process change, actions required for compliance with regulatory requirements and plant policy are shown on the review form.  All of these actions must be completed before the change can be made.\n\nA plant team consisting of both management and employees conducts in-depth incident investigations.  The plant burning and welding permit program is also the responsibility of both management and employees.  A trained in-plant auditor conducts compliance audits.  Contractors receive extensive training concerning plant hazards and the plant rules and procedures that have been developed to ensure a safe workplace.  Finally, mechanical integrity is assured by periodic inspections of all critical equipment.\n\nThe chemical specific accident prevention/mitigation measures are shown below.\n\nAnhydrous Hydrofluoric Acid\n?

The fluorine leak resulted from a `donut? failure on a fluorine cell.  Total hydrogen fluoride released during this incident was less than 1 pound.\n? On September 9, 2003 a maintenance employee received hydrogen fluoride inhalation and burns while replacing a dip-tube in a hydrogen fluoride vaporizer.  \n? On September 12, 2003 agency notifications were made in response to a release of 18 pounds of Antimony Pentafluoride (not an RMP chemical; however, it reacts with moisture in the ambient air to produce hydrogen fluoride, of which approximately 8 pounds were released).  There was no off-site impact, and no reportable thresholds were exceeded.\n? On December 22, 2003 agency notifications were made in response to a release of Uranium Hexafluoride (not an RMP chemical; however, it reacts with moisture in the ambient air to produce hydrogen fluoride, of which approximately 2 pounds were released).

Notifications to IEMA and NRC Operations Center will be made immediately following the notification to the local emergency services organization and within one hour of the emergency declaration. \n\nIf a Site Area Emergency is declared, the site automatically will issue Protective Action Recommendations (PARs) to shelter-in-place all members of the public within a 1.3 mile radius of the plant.  These PARs will be communicated to local emergency response officials and the community will be made aware of this emergency response activity.  After notifying 911 of an emergency affecting or potentially affecting the community, the Crisis Manager has the authority and is responsible for ordering the sounding of two Honeywell emergency sirens located on Highway 45 across from the plant.  In addition, the Crisis Manager will initiate an emergency phone call-down system ?Community Alert Network? (CAN) to notify residents by phone with specific emergency instructions.   Local Radio Stations will also be notified to communicate emergency information recordings as planned.\n\nAfter initial notification based on Honeywell needs and the emergency situation, local emergency services and law enforcement will coordinate efforts to protect the health and safety of the public, such as control of civil disturbances, off-site traffic control or other necessary actions. \n\nIf requested by Honeywell, Massac and Metropolis will provide its law enforcement, fire and emergency services personnel to assist Honeywell in containing and responding to an event.  \n\nThe Metropolis Works Emergency Response Team consists of approximately 75 people.
