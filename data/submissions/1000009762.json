Two incidents were removed from accident history, since they occurred more than 5 years ago.  Data elements were updated.  Removed butadiene and acrylonitrile scenarios, revised SO2 ARS and added ARS for anhydrous ammonia, but no changes to other WCS or ARS.\n\n09-Apr-07 - Resubmitted RMP due to shutdown of a unit and the startup of its replacement at 310 Block.  Data elements and SO2 ARS updated, but no change to other WCS or ARS or in accident history\n\n28-Oct-05 - Resubmitted RMP to reflect new regulated substance in existing facility and 2 new accidents in 5 year accident history.\n\n21-Jun-04 - Resubmitted RMP per 5 year update requirement.\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California site (Dow Pittsburg) is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Dow Pittsburg's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow Pittsburg's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Dow Pittsburg is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\n2.

These substances include ammonia (aqueous), ammonia (anhdyrous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhdyrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making emulsion polymers and an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Dow Pittsburg site was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDow Pittsburg maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nDow Pittsburg conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Dow Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI), Dow Chemical Exposure Index (CEI), R"

Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dow Pittsburg's covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nDow Pittsburg has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years, and more frequently as needed, for required process and safety topics.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDow Pittsburg carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance.  These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed.
