Two incidents were removed from accident history, since they occurred more than 5 years ago.  Data elements were updated.  Removed butadiene and acrylonitrile scenarios, revised SO2 ARS and added ARS for anhydrous ammonia, but no changes to other WCS or ARS.\n\n09-Apr-07 - Resubmitted RMP due to shutdown of a unit and the startup of its replacement at 310 Block.  Data elements and SO2 ARS updated, but no change to other WCS or ARS or in accident history\n\n28-Oct-05 - Resubmitted RMP to reflect new regulated substance in existing facility and 2 new accidents in 5 year accident history.\n\n21-Jun-04 - Resubmitted RMP per 5 year update requirement.\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Dow Chemical Company, Pittsburg, California site (\"Dow Pittsburg\") is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by Dow Pittsburg's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dow site in Pittsburg, California.  It is Dow Pittsburg's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.

These substances include ammonia (aqueous), ammonia (anhdyrous), chlorine, hydrogen chloride (anhydrous), hydrogen fluoride (anhydrous) and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous).  Ammonia (anhdyrous) is used in pollution control equipment for a boiler.  Ammonia (aqueous) is used in making emulsion polymers and an agricultural herbicidal intermediate.  Chlorine is used in making of intermediate and finished products for agricultural applications and is a byproduct of these processes.  Hydrogen chloride is made as a co-product of some of the agricultural product manufacturing processes.  Hydrogen fluoride and sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) are used to make agricultural products and intermediates.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe Dow Pittsburg site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  The Dow Pittsburg site was designed and constructed in accordance with Dow Loss Prevention Principles and Dow Engineering Standards.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nDow Pittsburg maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, equipment specification sheets, reactive chemicals testing reports, and corrosion reports.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nDow Pittsburg conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include Dow Fire and Explosion Index (F&EI), Dow Chemical Exposure Index (CEI), R"

Studies utilize an appropriate team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering, maintenance and process operations and are revalidated on a regular basis.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dow Pittsburg's covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nDow Pittsburg has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years, and more frequently as needed, for required process and safety topics.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nDow Pittsburg carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance.  These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nDow Pittsburg conducts audits of compliance systems for RMP requirements on a regular basis.  These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years by a team of qualified personnel.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nDow Pittsburg promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nDow Pittsburg truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.  Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.

Safe job performance is required for each of the jobs at the site.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, Dow Pittsburg hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance, construction and various other activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Dow Pittsburg has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also required to inform Dow of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4. Five-year Accident History\n\nDow Pittsburg has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases due to the site's release prevention policies.  There have been no accidental releases from Dow Pittsburg within the last 5 years with offsite impact (deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  There have been 5 onsite injuries, which required medical treatment, as a result of 2 separate accidental releases of regulated substances in the last 5 years.  One event involved the release of one pound or less of chlorine.  The other event involved the release of 186 pounds of chlorine.\n\n5. Emergency Response Plan\n\nDow Pittsburg utilizes a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  To ensure proper functioning, Dow Pittsburg emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nCA Region I"
