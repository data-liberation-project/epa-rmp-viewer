Bulk anhydrous ammonia is received via transport trucks, stored and used as a product to manufacture various blends of liquid starter fertilizers for use in the ag industry. This facility is subject to the Risk Management Program rule as a Program Level 3 facility.  This executive summary is our first means of communicating the risk to the public but also outlining our prevention program to further demonstrate we are a safe operator.\n\nThis RMP filing is the first-time submission for this RMP due to Redstar, LLC just starting the liquid starter manufacturing process.\n\nA.\t Accidental Release Prevention & Emergency Response Policy\nWe are a non-responding facility.  However, we have a Hazwoper trained employee and also coordinate with the LEPC on an annual basis our internal Emergency Action Plan and ensure we are currently included in the community emergency response program.  Our Emergency Action Plan provides procedures for our employees to conduct in the event of an uncontrolled release or any other RMP reportable incident.  \n\nWe do our best to prevent accidental releases.  We have well trained staff, established SOP\u0092s, and active and passive mitigation measures that act as additional fail-safe design.\n\nB.\tStationary Source & Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThis stationary source consists of a bulk tank of anhydrous ammonia.  Exact quantities are withheld from this executive summary as a means of protection from potential malicious acts.  The facility does hold in excess of the threshold planning quantity which subjects us to the RMP rule.  The process is very simple.  We receive anhydrous ammonia by transport truck and store it in a bulk tank.  It is then utilized in our PSM covered process to manufacture various liquid starter fertilizers.\n\nC.\tGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program & Chemical Specific Prevention steps\n\nOur overall Management System is laid out"

This facility has developed a worse-case and an alternative-release scenario as part of our Hazard Assessment; however, it has been withheld from this Executive Summary as security-sensitive information as requested by EPA & DHS.\n\nOur Prevention program consists of 14 elements:  \n1)\tEmployee Participation \u0096 The purpose of this element is to provide employees and management a chance to participate and cooperate the flow of necessary information for the safety of the process.\n2)\tProcess Safety Information - This information outlines the overall hazards of our regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia, includes our maximum intended inventory, safe upper & lower operating limits, provides equipment specifications, and lists any RAGAGEP we have deemed appropriate for our facility.\n3)\tProcess Hazard Analysis - This is a systematic approach used to identify hazards associated with our process that include human error and equipment malfunction as well as safeguards needed to prevent that from occurring.  It also includes steps needed to detect and monitor releases.\n4)\tStandard Operating Procedures - We have developed specific operating procedures for our facility.  Our employees have been trained in the appropriate procedures for their respective duties.  These procedures include initial startup, normal and temporary operations, normal and emergency shutdown, startup after a normal or emergency shutdown, equipment inspections, and consequences of deviations and how to correct or avoid those deviations.\n5)\tTraining - Our employees are trained at least every 3 years on the respective procedures and hazards associated with the process.  \n6)\tContractors \u0096 The purpose of this element is to ensure REDSTAR, LLC hires contractors that work around our anhydrous and liquid starter blending processes that have been screened and deemed safe for the desired task to work around a highly hazardous"

In the instances that those are unavailable, we use prior operating experience.  We understand that inspection and maintenance operators need further training, so we ensure each employee involved in the on-going mechanical integrity of the process has been trained in the hazards of the process, how to avoid or correct unsafe situations, and procedures applicable to the job tasks.  When we do utilize contractors at our anhydrous ammonia facility, we ensure that the contractors are trained and experienced to perform the task at hand.\n8)\tHot Work \u0096 The purpose of this element is to control hot work operations on or near the anhydrous and aqua ammonia facility.\n9)\tManagement of Change \u0096 The purpose for this element is to manage all modifications to equipment, procedures, processes, or the facility that affect the anhydrous or aqua ammonia facility.\n10)\tPre-Startup Safety Review \u0096 The purpose of this element is to ensure for new or modified facilities that when a modification causes a change in PSI, there are certain important considerations to be addressed before anhydrous is re-introduced into the process.\n11)\tIncident Investigation - If we have any incidents, we investigate them thoroughly to determine the cause and means to prevent it from occurring again.  This facility has had no incidents to investigate in the previous 5 years.\n12)\tEmergency Planning & Response \u0096 The purpose of this element is to establish and implement an emergency action plan and potentially an emergency response plan.\n13)\tCompliance Audits - At least once every 3 years, a person knowledgeable in the process conducts a compliance audit.  This is to determine if we have met our obligations under applicable parts of 40CFR Part 68.  Any deficiencies are outlined in our compliance audits with a timeline of expected completion.  Ideally,"

In addition, there have been no accidents resulting in releases of anhydrous ammonia with off-site consequences in the previous 5 years. Extensive programs and procedures are in place to maintain this record.\n\nE.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nAs mentioned above, we are a non-responding facility and have met the requirements of an Emergency Action Plan as well as coordinated efforts with our LEPC.  Furthermore, we will exercise our emergency notification procedures each calendar year.\n\nF.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCurrently our facility meets current RAGAGEP and there are no plans currently in place to improve safety other than continually evaluating our current programs and efforts for continuous improvement.  When the newer RAGAGEP is published, our company will evaluate it at the time and determine if enhancements need to be made."
