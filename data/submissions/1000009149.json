Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices\n\n\n\nAs stated in our Worldwide Health, Safety, and Environmental Policy and Principles, Momentive Speciality Chemcials is committed to health, safety, and environmental excellence.  To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health safety, and environmental issues.\n\n\n\nIn the Momentive Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases. \n\n\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual is Emergency Response Polices that states that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant's Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials. \n\n\n\n2. Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\n\n\nThis plant manufactures formaldehyde solutions.  The facility has the capability of producing products ranging from 30 to 51 percent formaldehyde; the balance of the solution is water and small amounts of methanol. The majority of formaldehyde produced at the site is pumped across the fenceline to our industrial neighbor.  The remaining formaldehyde is shipped to customers in the area by tank truck. \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\n? Formaldehyde solutions as (50%)2,500,000 lbs.\n\n\n\n3. Accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps\n\n\n\nThis plant has a comprehensive process safety management program that is in compliance with the EPA Accidental Release Prevention Rule, the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard, and all applicable state codes and regulations.

This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control checksheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.  The Plant Manager has overall responsibility for the safety program.\n\n\n\nAll employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation. The site manager maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program. Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference. By applying the information it contains their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\n\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify' hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release. As a result of initial process hazard reviews, a significant investment was made in process control Systems. In the formaldehyde plant, an automatic shutdown system is installed that will shut down the plant before a release occurs if safe operating conditions cannot be maintained.\n\n\n\nChanges to plant equipment, procedures, or processes are reviewed using a process hazard analysis. Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact.  Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change is made.\n\n\n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment. Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or preventive maintenance are performed. The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.  An electronic database is used to document these inspections as well as provide useful information "

One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire. The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance. These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\n\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices. Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated prior to their selection for jobs that impact process safety.\n\n\n\nIncidents that cause or could have caused a release are investigated and recommendations are made to prevent recurrence. These recommendations may lead to improvements in equipment, procedures, operating conditions, or training.\n\n\n\nInternal Corporate Health, Safety and Environmental Audits are conducted periodically to maintain compliance with local, state and fereal regulations. Regional Safety and Environmental professionals periodically review the health, safety and environmental programs. Addressing recommendations from these audits keeps the Facility's Safety and Environmental programs effective.\n\n\n\n4. Five-year accident history\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents or releases which meet the minimum reporting requirements set forth in the RMP regulations.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency response program\n\n\n\nMomentive has a contractual agreement with the neighboring Bayer plant to provide a well-trained and equipped Emergency Response Team.  Since the Momentive is located inside the Bayer complex response time will be minimal. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.  Planned changes to improve safety\n\n\n\nNo significant changes are planned."
