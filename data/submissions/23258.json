If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The acitivity of this company is the retail sale of anhydrous ammonia to area farmers as fertilizer for crop production.\n \nThe maximum quantity stored would be 106,000 pounds divided between two-12,000 gallon tanks filled at 85% capacity. The worse case release scenario would be a release of 53,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, over a ten minute period and has the potential to affect a total of 250 residents. The distance to end point in a worse case scenairo release would be 1.63 miles and has the potential to affect local residences as well as a school. The alternative release would be 11,908 lbs. release (transfer hose failure) in approximately 2 minutes. The release scenerio would have a distance to endpoint of .83 of a mile, affecting 200 residents with the same public receptors as listed in the worse case scenario. \n\nOur  plant is maintained in strict accordance with all state and federal rules and regulations. The employees who work at the facility are trained once a year on the proper procedures to operate the plant as well as the procedures to fill a nurse tank. Our workers always have safety water on hand and the proper personal protective equipment (gloves and goggles) during ammonia operations. Planned changes to improve safety will be dictated by the requirements of the Kansas Department of Agriculture. \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five-years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility nor; to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property d"
