      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Celanese's Bay City facility produces commodity organic chemicals, such as Vinyl Acetate and Acetaldehyde, using a variety of chemicals and processing operations. A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs is used to help ensure employee and public safety as well as protection of the environment in case of accidental release of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nFive chemicals such as Vinyl Acetate and Acetaldehyde, Acrolein, Methane, and Ethylene have been found to be regulated substances under the Risk Management Plan (RMP) program. Among these five chemicals, Vinyl Acetate and Acetaldehyde have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release. \n\n\n\nToxics:\n\n\n\nVinyl acetate monomer is a major product.  It is produced in the Vinyl Acetate manufacturing process unit and is used largely in the manufacturing of adhesives and paints.  These materials are subsequently used for safety glass for automobiles, in floorings and rigid PVC pipe.  Approximately 4,000,000 pounds are stored on-site in the largest nitrogen inerted atmospheric storage tank. \n\n \n\nFlammables:\n\n\n\nAcetaldehyde is a byproduct in the production of vinyl acetate.  It is separated and sold in the merchant market.  Approximately 420,000 pounds of liquid acetaldehyde are stored in two pressurized spheres.  The standard operating procedure limits the inventory to less than or equal to 50% in each sphere. \n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that are posed to employees, the public, and the environment through the use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nCelanese is committed to operating and maintaining all processes within the Complex in a safe and r"

Accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are in place to ensure employee and public safety as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that have been designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\n-- A description of our facility and the list of the substances used which \n\n  are regulated by EPA's RMP\n\n-- An overview of accidental release prevention programs\n\n-- A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals \n\n  regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n\n-- An overview of the emergency response program\n\n-- An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent \n\n  accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely \n\n  affecting employees, the public, and the environment \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe following chemical-specific steps are taken to prevent accidental releases:\n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Vinyl Acetate Include:\n\n\n\n? Use of nitrogen blanketing in storage tanks to avoid flammability\n\n? Use of polymerization inhibitor additive to limit polymerization in the \n\n  system\n\n? Bulk storage is located away from processing areas in tank farm areas with\n\n  secondary containment sufficient to handle spills.\n\n? Remote activated firewater monitors and emergency response equipment is \n\n  readily available\n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Acetaldehyde Include:\n\n\n\n? Use of mounted water spray around the acetaldehyde spheres for fire \n\n  protection \n\n\n\n? Sphere has remote isolation capabilities and gas detection system.\n\n\n\nThese individual elements of the prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Celanese and its employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set and have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that the requirements of the law and our own internal standards for accident prev"

      "SummaryText": "ention are met.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nRecords are kept for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur.  During the past five years, there has not been a release involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or offsite injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.   \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\n\n\nThe Celanese and Oxea Emergency Plan (Plan) provides procedures and guidelines for an orderly and safe response to emergency situations. The Plan includes responses for protection of employees, the environment, community and equipment resulting from hazardous releases of chemicals, including vinyl acetate and acetaldehyde.  Essential planning and training needed to ensure protection of workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations are fundamental to the Plan.  The Plan includes instructions for notifying the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) immediately when appropriate.  There are also emergency drills conducted by the site along with community first responders, sheriff's department and hospital.\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nA PHA revalidation is scheduled to occur in 2017 that will provide a thorough evaluation of the Vinyl Acetate manufacturing process unit and will generate recommendations for improvement.  All recommendations are to be implemented in a reasonable and timely manner, with priority given-up to and including cessation of production-to implementation of recommendations, depending on the level of risk.  \n\n\n\nIn addition, Celanese will continue efforts to help prevent and improve response to accidental chemical releases.  These continued efforts include the following:\n\n\n\n? Utilize employee hazard-recognition programs to help identify and address \n\n  hazards within the site\n\n\n\n? Implement process safety best-practices through common Celanese work\n\n  practices such as MOC and Energy "
