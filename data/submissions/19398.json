All of the products from the Bethlehem facility are distributed by truck.  Each of the substances above is listed as a regulated flammable substance in EPA's Risk Management Program rule, with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds. The methane storage and transfilling process at the Bethlehem plant contains about 49,000 pounds, the ethane process contains about 10,000 pounds, the ethylene process contains about 15,000 pounds and the trichlorosilane storage and transfilling process at the Bethlehem plant contains up to 41,000 pounds of product.  Consequently, each process is subject to the RMP rule.\n\nUnder the RMP rule, Praxair is required to report one Worst Case Scenario that represents all of the regulated flammable substances at the Bethlehem facility.  The Worst Case Scenario is defined by the EPA as the release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in the process, with essentially none of the safety systems and devices that are in place to prevent such an occurrence functioning as designed.  The released gas is assumed to ignite, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  Given these conditions, we are then required to estimate the distance to an EPA-specified flammable endpoint, which is defined to be an overpressurization effect of 1 pound per square inch.  At the Bethlehem facility, the Worst Case Scenario would involve the methane storage tank, which contains about 21,500 pounds.  Using the criteria listed above, the Worst Case Scenario would r"

To determine this distance, we used the EPA's RMP Off-Site Consequence Analysis Guidance.\n\nWe are also required to report one Alternative Release Scenario, or planning scenario, for the flammable processes.  While an Alternative Release may never occur at a facility, it is generally accepted to be more likely, or more credible, than the Worst Case Scenario, and can be used by the facility and local response organizations to plan community emergency response activities.  The RMP rule assumes more typical atmospheric and weather conditions for an Alternative Release Scenario, and allows a facility to take credit for safety devices and other mitigation systems that are in place to minimize the likelihood and effects of a release.  When selecting an Alternative Release Scenario, EPA suggests a facility consider scenarios such as transfer hose releases, valve and flange leaks, pump seal leaks, and shipping container mishaps, among others.\n\nFor the flammable processes at Bethlehem, a credible release would be a process piping failure resulting in a methane gas release at grade.  An accidental release of this type may occur due to mechanical failure, corrosion, failure of a piping component (such as a joint or valve), impact by a vehicle, or other cause.  At the Bethlehem facility, a release of this type could result in the released gas igniting, causing a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance to the EPA-specified endpoint of 1 pound per square inch overpressure is about 0.05 miles, or about 265 feet.  To determine this distance, we used the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.\n\nIn accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management standard and EPA's Risk Management Program rule, the Bethlehem facility has a comprehensive accident prevention program in place to ensure the safety of our employees, our neighbors and the community around us.

In the event of an emergency, the facility has an emergency action plan in place, which contains procedures for employees to follow, including notification of local response agencies.
