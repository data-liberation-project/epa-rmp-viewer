Plate Products (Outokumpu) will conduct its operations in such a way as to avoid harm to its employees and all others who may be affected directly or indirectly by its activities, and to maintain the highest practically achievable standards of safety, occupational, health, and working environment.  They will also strive to ensure that there will be no damage to plant, equipment, materials or any other property as the result of accidents or fires.  Health, safety, and the protection of the working environment have equal status with other primary business objectives.  Safe working practices and due consideration of the working environmental factors are vital to the business.  Health, safety, and the protection of the working environment are the direct responsibility of management, and consequently form an integral part of the duties of all Managers and Supervisors.  All employees will take a personal responsibility for their health and safety and for the protection of the working environment.  Outokumpu, Inc., will ensure that employees have the required skills and support to meet this commitment.  In addition, Outokumpu promotes and welcomes the active participation of all in its employ in the establishment and observance of measures to improve their health, safety, and working environment.  All contracting companies engaged by Outokumpu and their employees, are required to work to similar, consistently high standards, and achieve comparable levels of performance.  Outokumpu is committed to compliance with all statutory obligations concerning health, safety, and the working environment, which apply in each country of operation.\n\nOutokumpu produces hot rolled stainless steel plate. Stainless steel plate is received as either direct to gauge or cogg plate.  The cogg plate is cut on a hydraulic shear into lengths ranging from 50 to 490 inches, depending on the order.  The rolled finished sizes of the cog plate range from 3/16 to 6 inches thick up to 120"

      "SummaryText": "inches wide and 420 inches long.  The cut cogg plate is then heated in natural gas fired furnaces and rolled to finish gauge.  The rolling process can require heating of the coggs up to three times before reaching finished gauge.  After rolling, the plates are annealed to improve the internal structure of the plate.  The plates then move to the finishing department.  The plates are shotblasted to remove the scale, oxidized steel, that forms on the surface during annealing.  The plates are then flattened and cut to their final length and width.  The next process for the plates is pickling followed by final inspection and placement in the warehouse for shipment to customers.  The process of concern is a 6,500 gallon above ground storage tank (AST) containing a 70% solution of Hydrofluoric Acid.  This acid is used in the pickling operation.  Plates are placed in the acid to assist in removing scale oxidation from the steel surface.  Outokumpu has identified a worst-case scenario for the hydrofluoric acid AST vessel that involves the release of all of the hydrofluoric acid over a 10 minute period (67,763 lbs).  The AST is equipped with high-level alarms, double-walls with interstitial monitoring equipment and alarms, manual and automatic shut off valves, pressure relief valve, and is located in a containment area.  The alternative scenario for Outokumpu is for the vessel to leak due to a puncture from facility forklifts or other equipment.  It was estimated that a puncture of 4 inches would occur with the liquid column height above the puncture at six (6) feet.  If this alternative scenario occurred, 67,600 lbs. of hydrofluoric acid would be released at a rate of 196 gallons per minute.   No active or passive mitigation measures were considered.  \n\nOutokumpu Employees are trained in proper handling of Hydrofluoric Acid.  There has not been an accidental release of Hydrofluoric Acid in over ten (10) years.\n\nIf a spill should occur, the emergency coordinator for Outokumpu"

Outokumpu has coordinated response actions with the local police department and fire department, New Castle Fire Department.  In the event of required cleanup, the New Castle Fire Department will respond to the release.  No Outokumpu employee will perform clean up activities.  The emergency coordinator shall also contact the appropriate environmental regulatory agencies.\n\nSpill incidents may present hazards to public health or the environment.  The emergency coordinator will take immediate actions to prevent migration of the substance or contaminated water off the property or into navigable waterways, water supplies, or aquifers.  If harmful vapors are released, the emergency coordinator shall notify the local authorities of this condition and will help advise or evacuate persons downwind from the site as necessary.  Outokumpu has a training program to ensure that all facility personnel are familiar with the proper handling of hazardous material emergencies by familiarizing them with emergency procedures, emergency equipment procedures, emergency equipment, and emergency systems."
