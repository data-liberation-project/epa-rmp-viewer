              "Description": "Process Safety Information:  The following information regarding the chlorine system is stored and maintained on-site.  Material Safety Data Sheets, maximum intended inventory,safe upper and lower temperatures, pressures, flows and compositions, manufacturer's equipment specifications,  and codes and standards for design, construction and operation of the system.  The system was designed by a licensed professional engineer in accordance with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.  It is operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.  A hazard review was conducted for this site in May, 1999.  A complete set of operating procedures are kept at the plant site.  All the employees working at this facility have been trained in all of the pertinent operatin procedures.  Complete training manuals and procedures are kept at the plant.  Refresher training is conducted by the safety manager of this facility on and as-needed basis but no less than three years.  We verify that all employees are adhering to the principles and procedures as outlined in the training programs and operating procedures.  The chlorine process equipment is maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.  Routine maintenance is conducted regularly and as needed at the site.  In addition, a complete maintenance and hazard review check is conducted prior to rotation of each cylinder.  Maintenance logs are kept on site documenting all internal maintenance as well as any items completed by outside contracts.  The city has required procedures for the implementaion of any changes that will affect the chlorine feed process including, technical basis for the change, impact of the change on safety and health, required modifications to the operating procedures, required time frame, and required additional training.  A pre-startup review shall be completed at the startup of any new stationary or significantly modified source for chlorine feed.  A compliance audit will be conducted for this site a minimum of every three years.  This facility has had no incident that would qualify under Section 112(r).  A written plan of action has been developed regarding employee participation, consultation and access to process hazard analyses.  No hot work may be conducted near the facilty without the issuance of a hot work permit.  The city has required procedures for the selection and performance requirements for contractors which meet the requirements of section 68.87.",

Chlorine is the\nonly chemical which is stored at the site in amounts above the threshold quantity as specified in EPA's\n40CFR68 and the OSHA PSM Standard 29CFR 1910.119.\n\nThis facility is a trickling filter, wastewater treatment plant which uses chlorine for a disinfectant as part of the\ntreatment process.  This is one of two treatment plants which serve the City of Warner Robins.  The plant is\npermitted for three (3) million gallons per day and is currently operating at an average of two (2) million\ngallons per day.  Gaseous chlorine is supplied to the plant by a one(1) ton cylinder with one additional one (1)\nton cylinder as storage.  Maximum on-site storage is six thousand (6000) pounds.  The process includes\nchlorinators, injectors, vacuum regulator and associated valves, piping and safety equipment.\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and\nregulations.  The chlorine system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-55 and state\nlaw.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property, or environmental\ndamage, evacuations or shelters in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving chlorine system, it is our policy to notify the City of Warner Robins\nFire Department by way of the 911 service and request that they respond to the emergency.
