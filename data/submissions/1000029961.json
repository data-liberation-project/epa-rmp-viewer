The location of the ammonia vessels is inside the engine room. Although there are doors and windows, the overall enclosure acts as a dike creating liquid pooling and limiting the liquid run-off. Ammonia leak detection is installed in this area that sounds alarms and starts emergency ventilation. The emergency ventilation is automatically controlled and discharges the engine room air through the roof which creates a lower level of concentration in the engine room for responders. It\r\nalso starts air dispersion at lower concentration levels and disperses the ammonia with greater air turbulence."

The only RMP regulated substance at this facility is anhydrous ammonia which is classified is as a toxic substance, liquefied under pressure. The definitions and parameters for the following release scenarios are based on the Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration as described in Chapter 4: Off-site Consequence Analysis.\r\nThe worst-case release scenario (OCA-1) used in this assessment identifies the medium temperature recirculator (V-3) as the vessel with the potential to hold the largest quantity of ammonia. This is based on the system design that uses this vessel as a pump-down holding receiver. The worst-case release scenario is based on a technician using a man lift to replace a lamp near the recirculator vessel strikes the level column with the lift causing the column to fail releasing the entire vessel charge. 3,850 lbs. could be lost. The\r\nDistance to Toxic Endpoint of 0.8 miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 31,700 people.\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario is the direct release of ammonia vapor from the service valve on the high stage compressor. The  of the release is based on the rated capacity of the pressure relief valve (33.0 lbs per min.) with a release duration of 15 minutes. The Distance to Toxic Endpoint of 0.1 miles creates a Circle of Concern that includes a residential population of 0 people.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\nThis facility follows the OSHA Process Safety Management Program.
