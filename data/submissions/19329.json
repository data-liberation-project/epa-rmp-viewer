(SAA) facility complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning chlorine gas storage.\n\nA description of the facility and the regulated substances handled:  The SAA facility includes a maximum quantity of chlorine gas (Cl2) approximating 16,000 pounds in eight, 2,000 pound pressurized containers attached to the process and normally between eight and sixteen extra 2,000 pound pressurized containers for back-up not attached to the process.  The NAICS Industrial Code for the facility is 331314.  The chlorine is utilized in the secondary aluminum process at the facility to reduce the magnesium content of the molten aluminum charge. This is the only substance handled at the facility that is currently regulated under the OSHA standard at 29 CFR1910.119 and Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA), Section 112(r) Risk Management Planning requirements.  Cl2 (CAS No. 7782-50-5) is designated as a regulated toxic substance (gas) under the USEPA Provisions for Chemical Accident Prevention (40 CFR  Part 68) with a threshold quantity of 1,500 pounds.  The chlorine OSHA threshold quantity is also 1,500 pounds.  Since the facility stores quantities of chlorine in excess of this applicable threshold, SAA is required to prepare and submit a Risk Management Plan and comply with the requirements of 40 CFR 68 as authorized by the CAAA, Section 112(r).  The SAA RMP must meet 40 CFR 68 Program 3 RMP requirements, since the worst-case offsite consequence analysis, in terms of the distance to 1 psi over pressure in the event of maximum storage container evacuation, could potentially impact offsite populations and receptors.  The chlorine storage is part of the secondary aluminum process and exceeds the threshold quantity which requires a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM).  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario:  The wor"

      "SummaryText": "st-case scenario proscribed for the SAA facility is the failure of one of the 163-gallon storage tanks (per 40 CFR Part 68, Subsections 68.25) when filled (100% at 60 F), resulting in a toxic vapor cloud release, due to the release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine.  Based on  EPA's RPM guidance tables, the distance to the 1 psi over pressure endpoint is 0.6 miles.   Within this area potential receptors include: 1 residential unit with an estimated population of 3 people.  The basis for this approximation was determined from information obtained from the Allen County Planning Services Department regarding the average number of occupant per household in Allen county(2.63 people/house).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable codes and regulations.\n\nFive-year accident history:  The SAA facility  has not had an accident involving chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, or evacuations, within the past five years.\n\nThe emergency response program:  The SAA facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations for chlorine storage.  If an emergency were to occur, it is SAA policy to notify the City of New Haven / Adams Township Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Additionally, The Allen County Emergency Management Agency, and Jefferson Township officials will be notified.  The SAA facility property lines are all within Jefferson Township.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:  None."
