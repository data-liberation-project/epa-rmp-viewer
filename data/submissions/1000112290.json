Referenced documents, such as the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan, Process Safety Management Plan, and SPCC plans are maintained at the facility and are available for inspection. \nPrevention and Emergency Response Policies \nThe White Springs Agricultural Chemicals (WSA) policy is to provide a safe work environment for all employees, contractors, visitors and neighbors. This policy includes prevention of accidental releases through the use of initial design to recognized standards, preventive maintenance programs, testing, calibrations, routine maintenance, inspections, replacement of equipment as necessary, and training of personnel. A Management of Change process is used for all changes other than replacement in kind. A work order system is in place for employees to formally report deficiencies and track progress until completed. \nIt is WSA\u0092s policy to operate in an environmentally responsible manner consistent with environmental knowledge, policies, and regulations. Operations of the facility are designed so as not to adversely affect the environment of the surrounding area during normal operating periods or emergencies. \nThe goal of WSA is to prevent emergencies from ever occurring. However, should an event occur, the immediate goal is to keep the emergency and its effects within facility boundaries and not allow it to present a threat to the health and safety of the public. All procedures will be carried out in a manner to minimize risk to employees and emergency response personnel. Rescue and medical activities have priority over all other actions. \nIt is the emergency response policy of WSA to immediately notify Hamilton County authorities, the LEPC, the State Emergency Response Commission, and the National Response Center of a release of anhydrous ammonia that exceeds the reportable quantity. WSA\u0092s employees will mitigate or contain the release and assist in"

Phosphate rock mining takes places within a project area of over 100,000 acres or about 160 square miles. The Hamilton County Mine, located just off US 41 approximately eight miles north of White Springs, produces nearly four million tons of phosphate rock each year. This rock is used at the two chemical plants to produce various phosphate products. The Swift Creek Chemical Plant is located on US 41 adjacent to the Hamilton County Mine. The Suwannee River Chemical Plant is located on County Road 137, approximately six miles north of White Springs. \nThe Suwannee River plant produces a sulfur enhanced mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) and an ammonia based fertilizer called Poly 11. The Sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, are used as the primary ingredients in production. However, anhydrous ammonia is the only RMP-regulated substance that is stored above the threshold quantity. In addition, the Suwannee River plant is the only location that stores and processes anhydrous ammonia. \nAnhydrous ammonia is delivered to the Suwannee River plant by trucks that are not disconnected while unloading. The ammonia is stored in four \"bullets\" (tanks). Safety features in the storage area include relief valves and excess flow valves on the tanks, ammonia sensors and alarms, and a shutoff valve system to stop transfers of ammonia - if preset conditions are exceeded. These valves will fail-closed in case of a power failure. The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the trucks to the storage area using specially designed piping and pumps. Safety features in the unloading area include: \nAn emergency shut-off valve system (which fails closed in case power is lost) activated by any of six switches located strategically throughout the area, \nExcess flow valves in case of line failure, \nArea ammonia sensors and alarms, \nVideo"

Additionally, the use of Safety and Operating Procedures provides a system to prevent accidental releases by focusing on specific components of each job task. The safety and operating procedures manuals contain detailed job descriptions related to each task. The manuals are reviewed annually and revised as necessary to address any changes. Each shipment receives a detailed pre-unloading inspection, inspection during unloading, and a post unloading inspection by the operator. Employees and contractors are trained regularly to insure proficiency in all phases of the operation. \nFive Year Accident History \nThere have been no releases of ammonia meeting the reporting requirements of \u00a768.42(a) of the RMP rule during the last five years. In fact, there have been no releases of ammonia that have affected offsite receptors in the 50+ year operating history of the facility. \nThe Emergency Response Program \nThe WSA\u0092s facility has developed an Emergency Management Plan designed to address prevention, preparation, response and recovery from a variety of potential emergencies. This includes an accidental release of a regulated substance at the facility. The facility, its employees and business operations are susceptible to emergencies such as natural disasters, severe weather, and man-made hazards. The Emergency Management Plan, in conjunction with the Risk Management Program and the OSHA Process Safety Management Program combine for management of potential emergency situations.

In addition to the initial training programs for all emergency response team members, quarterly refresher training is provided along with frequent drills and exercises. Emergency response equipment is maintained in prime condition and includes two fully equipped ambulances, a hazardous materials response vehicle, two fire engines, a water tanker with a monitor nozzle, and sophisticated rescue apparatus. \nThe emergency response teams operate under the NIMS Incident Command System. All positions in each response team have at least two alternates and all members of the Emergency Management Group have designated and trained alternates. \nBecause of the isolated nature of the location, the WSA facility coordinates training programs with the local fire and rescue teams. This training includes joint exercises. \nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \nA Safety Plan is developed each year by the Safety Manager and staff and followed to completion. Additional improvements will include the implementation of the Action Items identified by the 2024 Process Safety Management audit. Additionally, a joint project between WSA, Hamilton County and Windstream has installed a telephone ring-down system designed for notifications in the event of an emergency anywhere in the county."
