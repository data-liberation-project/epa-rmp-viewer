      "SummaryText": "THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nIntermediate-pressure field gas enters Red Bluff Booster Station via the inlet separator, where condensate and slop water are separated from the gas. The separated gas is then compressed and transported offsite via the high pressure discharge pipeline. Slop water collected from the inlet separator and liquids separated at the inlet suction scrubber are eventually drained to an atmospheric storage tank, where it collects before being transported offsite via truck. No additional operating scenarios are being included in this registration.  \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the covered process at the facility.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEmployees of the Red Bluff Booster Station are encouraged to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nThe Red Bluff Booster Station keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the process. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility. Chemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in the operations procedures manual. The facili"

The facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provides a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe Red Bluff Booster Station has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the covered process are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. The Red Bluff Booster Station primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations to management of the potential hazards associated with the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. All approved mitigation options are tracked until completion. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained. The facility periodically updates and re-validates the PHA to assure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and identify new potential hazards. These periodic reviews are conducted at least ever"

Procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are kept current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. Covered process operating procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task(s) and maintain the covered process unit within its safe limits.\n\nTraining\nThe Red Bluff Booster Station has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in facility operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operation is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years, or more frequ"
