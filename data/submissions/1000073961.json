Ammonia sensors are also located in the cooler and dock areas along with the freezer.  These sensors will alarm.  The system has safety relief valves installed with a 5 year replacement program.  High liquid level in the -20F & +20F vessels will alarm and compressors will be shut down.  This are low level alarms and will shut recirculation pumps off.  There is an interlock that will not allow the low temperature compressors to start before the high temperature compressors. A micro processor control panel on each compressor monitors system temperatures, pressures, oil pressures. The main control panel monitors the room temperatures and the evaporative condenser pressure by operating water pumps and the variable frequncy drive fan motors.   ",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWe take many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  These precautions include safety controls (detection systems, alarms and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like pressure increases that could cause a system failure.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems and a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel.  All employees are informed of hazards in the workplace.  Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive proper training in the handling of those substances.  This facility has procedures in place to safely remove employees from areas in the unlikely event that a hazardous substance release were to occur, and to put in place emergency notification and response procedures.\n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nRoehl Cold Storage, located in Owen, WI operates an ammonia refrigeration system for product cooling and freezing for its customer base. The regulated substance at this facility, anhydrous ammonia, is used in a closed-loop refrigeration system for product cooling. In order to protect its employees, the public and the environment, Roehl Cold Storage has an integrated safety management program to prevent ammonia releases and mitigate the consequences of a release, should one occur.\n\n\n\n3. Worst Case and Alternative Case Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nOff Site Consequence (OCA) data is available for review onsite at the Roehl Cold Storage facility.\n\n\n\n4. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nThis Roehl Cold Storage facility has an accidental release prevention program that complies with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Rule. The prevention program consists of the fo"

Because of the pungent odor of ammonia, any leak is easily detected.  The compressor room is provided with ammonia detectors that activate if ammonia is detected.  The refrigeration system is designed so that major components can be isolated by closing selected valves.  Further, refrigeration system operators have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of the refrigeration system.  In case of a release that could travel off the plant property, calls would be made to the Owen Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to assist in the response.  Other state and federal notifications would be made as required.\n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDuring the last five years, there have been no reportable releases of ammonia.\n\n\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThis food processing facility has procedures in place to respond to the release of a hazardous substance.  Employees are trained to evacuate their respective areas in accordance with OSHA 1910.38(a).  Coordination with the local fire department is initiated during an emergency situation.\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRoehl Cold Storage expects to improve safety performance by emphasizing all elements of its PSM/RMP program.  All recommendations during the Process Hazard Analysis were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process.  Roehl Cold Storage expects to evaluate each recommendatio"
