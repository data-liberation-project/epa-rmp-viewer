Compliance with EPA's Chemical Accidental Prevention Provisions (40 CFR Part 68), Federal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM), and Cal OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) is also be maintained. This plan has been developed specifically to address the requirements applicable to the use of anhydrous ammonia in a closed loop mechanical refrigeration system at Columbus Foods, 30977 San Antonio Street, Hayward, California.  Each of the following sections provides a general overview of the facility requirements and defines design attributes, documentation, and actions that are established to comply with those requirements.  Columbus Foods has already developed measures and systems that provide compliance with the CalARP rules as a result of meeting other regulatory program requirements.  This document does not replicate that information but rather provides cross-references to the applicable existing documentation.  In those instances where information was developed specifically to comply with the CalARP requirements, that information is contained in this document.  Note:  Columbus has rewritten and improved the company's CalARP/RMP/PSM programs.  All documentation prior to this effort is on-hand and available; all new programs/policies implemented as a result of this effort are initiated and are being utilized moving forward.\n\n1.1.\tCommitment to Safety\n\nColumbus Foods is committed to providing all employees a work environment that is free from recognized health and safety hazards.  Accordingly, our goal is achieving and sustaining \"Zero Accident Tolerance\" through communication, information, and training.  We are dedicated to the concept that all employees receive the proper orientation and are provided with the means necessary to ensure the"

Where hazardous toxics cannot be eliminated, engineering/administrative controls to handle these substances will be implemented.\n\n1.1.4.\tColumbus Foods has prepared a safety policy and procedures program specifically tailored for the facility in addition to establishing a Process Safety Management Program.  It is the responsibility of the facility's management to carry out these programs.\n\n1.1.5.\tThe first duty of Columbus Foods employees is to exercise care in the performance of their work tasks to prevent an accident to themselves, co-workers, the general public or equipment.  Safety-consciousness must take precedence over expedience, and is required as a condition of continued employment of all employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n1.2.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n1.2.1.\tColumbus will make all reasonable efforts to continually monitor and improve the safety of its systems.\n\n1.2.2.\tRegulatory program implementation will facilitate follow-up items from the following activities: Process Hazard Analyses, Seismic Studies, Incident"

      "SummaryText": "Investigations, Operating Procedure Reviews, and Compliance Audits.  Columbus is committed to implementing the recommendations from these activities as a way of always improving safety.\n \n1.2.3.\tIn addition, more dramatic system changes such as alternate refrigerants (i.e.: expanded use of glycol), better confinement of ammonia charge, advanced detection and alarming, and public notification are always being investigated.  If appropriate, future changes to improve safety will be implemented.\n\n\n1.3.\tColumbus Foods Description\n\n1.3.1.\tColumbus Foods is located at 30977 San Antonio Street, Hayward, California. The facility is a salame and deli meat slicing facility that receives work in progress from other facilities. The work in progress is sliced and packaged on site to make final products for distribution. \n\n1.3.2.\tAnhydrous ammonia, which is regulated under CalARP, is utilized at Columbus Foods in the facility's ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia is contained in various vessels, piping, evaporators, condensers, compressors and miscellaneous refrigeration equipment located throughout the refrigeration system.  The system is a single stage, critically charged system.  The system has two screw compressors, two condensers, one high pressure receiver and one high temperature receiver with two pumps that supplies recirculated ammonia liquid to 12 evaporators and a plate and frame heat exchanger.  Liquid refrigerant supplied to the evaporator units and heat exchanger absorbs heat energy from the surrounding air, the addition of heat energy to the refrigerant causes a change in density.  The less dense refrigerant returns to the high temp receiver where it separates with the vapor being drawn off into the high stage suction header.  The compressors maintain a constant suction pressure in the header.\n\n1.3.3.\tAs a result of the use of anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant at Columbus Foods, the facility has developed and implemented a Level 3 Prevention Program in accord"

A Management System has been developed to oversee the regulatory programs at the Columbus Foods facility.   \n\n1.4.\tWorst/Alternate Case Release Scenarios\n\n1.4.1.\tAlthough engineering controls incorporated into the refrigeration process would normally prevent such releases, the possibility of a \"catastrophic release\" does exist.  Based on that premise, the facility has modeled two off site consequence analyses; one worst case scenario, and one alternate case scenario. Scenario documentation is on file at the San Antonio facility.\n\n1.4.2.\tFor all scenarios, EPA's RMP Comp (Revision 1.07) modeling software was used to determine Off-Site Consequence Analyses.  The distance to the toxic endpoint for such a release and potential receptors are discussed in Section 3.2 and shown on maps in Appendix B of this document.\n\n1.5.\tEmergency Response Program\n\n1.5.1.\tColumbus Foods is equipped with emergency warning systems.  Alarms (both visual and auditory) are strategically placed throughout the facility to alarm personnel of an emergency relating to the accidental release of anhydrous ammonia or other emergencies that may be encountered.  There are specific procedures that all employees will follow in the event of release, which can be found in the facility Emergency Response Plan on file and located with other critical regulatory program documentation. These procedures include appropriate notification and evacuation of facility personnel.\n\n1.5.2.\tIn the event that an ammonia release or spill does occur, off-site responders, specifically the Hayward Fire Department and the Alameda County LEPC, and immediate neighboring facilities will be notified."
