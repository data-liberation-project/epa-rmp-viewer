AGI has coordinated with Cosumnes Fire Department (CFD) who has visited the plant in 2017 and 2018.  Discussions are being held about using the facility to train CFD First Responders regarding ammonia releases. AG's Emergency Action Plan applicable to anhydrous ammonia consists of evacuating the facility and notifying of public agency First Responders of any hazardous materials releases by dialing 911. AGI is a non-responding facility per Cal/OSHA General Industrial Safety Order (GISO) 3220.  AGI will assist First Responders as needed and requested. \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\nAGI will make changes to improve the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system as regulations change and operating experience suggests changes in operating and maintenance procedures. In addition, AGI makes use of compliance audits, Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs), and incident investigation reports to improve the system safety. AGI conducted an external Mechanical Integrity (MI) audit in 2017 for the first time.  This will continue on a 5-year cycle going forward.\r\n\r\nAGI recognizes that the CalARP / RMP process is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving anhydrous ammonia handling operations at its facility. AGI will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. \r\n\r\nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the PHA that AGI committed to accomplish will be completed within the regulatory required time frame (30 months). Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities, will be reviewed and considered for implementation."

AGI uses ammonia in the ice plant's refrigeration system which serves both warehouse cooling and ice production.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Programs\r\nGeneral accident release prevention programs instituted by AGI are categorized as engineering controls (physical barriers); administrative (management) programs; procedures, training, and emergency action/response programs.  \r\n\r\nAGI has instituted quality control procedures, written operating and maintenance procedures, an inspection and testing program, maintenance, and emergency response, and a management system.  AGI has also implemented a process safety program in compliance with Federal and California OSHA PSM. These constitute the general accident release prevention programs for anhydrous ammonia at this site.\r\n\r\nAGI understands the importance of following industry standard principles called Recognized and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practices (RAGAGEP).  It follows the Federal OSHA enforcement policy for RAGAGEP described in 2016 as the basis for its implementation.\r\n\r\nChemical-Specific Release Prevention Steps\r\nRelease prevention steps specific to anhydrous ammonia have been identified and have been implemented.  These include installing panic bars on exterior exit doors,  adding a chain to allow for closure of the manual king valve from ground level, coordinating with the Cosumnes Fire Department (CFD), maintenance procedures tracked by a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) based on IIAR Bulletin 109 mechanical integrity RAGAGEP recommendations, and approximately annual review of operating procedures.  \r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\nAGI has not had a release within the last 5+years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAGI's Emergency Response Program applicable to anhydrous ammonia consists of notification of the public agency assigne"

This is done to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  In order to accomplish this goal, AGI has gathered safety information on anhydrous ammonia and on the process, equipment and procedures involving anhydrous ammonia; performed a structured assessment of hazards of the process and external events which might affect the process; performed an offsite consequences analysis of defined release scenarios; established a written program for prevention and mitigation of releases; and established a written emergency action program coordinated with emergency response agencies.  \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nAGI owns and operates the ice manufacturing plant on a site located immediately south of the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant, at 8580 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove in Sacramento County.

This request was made in March 1997 pursuant to California Health & Safety Code (H&SC) Division 20, Chapter 6.95, Article 2, Section 25534(b)(1) and California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, Chapter 4.5, California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) At that time, Carson Energy owned Mountain Glacier Ice (facilities in Fremont and Elk Grove) and operated the Central Valley Finance Authority's cogeneration facility for SMUD.  Carson Energy produced a combined RMP for the Elk Grove facility that incorporated the function of the cogeneration facility as a Program 3 facility and the ice plant as a Program 2 facility.\r\n\r\nCarson Energy sold Mountain Glacier Ice to the Arctic Glacier Ice Company, a Canadian company, in 2006. The Canadian parent company was sold to H.I.G. Investment in June 2012, and again to the Carlyle Group in March 2017.Both H.I.G. and Carlyle are holding companies that directed Arctic Glacier and have not been involved in day-to-day operations in Elk Grove. Management of the Elk Grove facility has remained the same since 2006 except for retirement and internal promotion. It currently uses the name of Arctic Glacier Premium Ice (AGI).\r\n\r\nSCEMD requested that the Carson Energy Cogeneration facility and the AGI facility each maintain separate RMPs due to the 2006 change in ownership.  This RMP is the result of that request. It was first filed in 2008 and was updated in May 2013. The previous update in 2018 followed the format established by SCEMD in 2015. Based on a subsequent internal audit, it was determined that this facility contained an inventory of an RS in a process that makes it subject to Federal and Cal"
