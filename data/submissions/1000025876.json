The facility is part of Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC (Brenntag), headquartered in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.  Brenntag is an advanced distribution company serving customers worldwide with products, chemicals and advanced materials.  The company ranks among the top chemical distribution firms in North America.\n\n\n\nIt is the worldwide policy of Brenntag to design, blend and distribute its products, and to handle materials throughout their life cycle in a manner that protects the environment and safeguards employees, customers, and the public from unacceptable risk.  This facility participates in the Responsible Distribution Process program of the National Association of Chemical Distributors.  The Community Outreach and Emergency Response Plan of Responsible Distribution brings chemical distribution plants and local communities together through communication and cooperative emergency planning.  It is also company policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations. \n\n\n\nThe Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC Chicago facility is located at 4801 South Austin Ave. in an unincorporated area of Stickney Township, near Chicago, in Cook County, Illinois.  Brenntag employs approximately 43 people at this location.  The primary purpose of this facility is the distribution (including repackaging and storage) of industrial and fine chemicals.  The regulated processes at this location include the storage and distribution of \"factory-filled containers\" of Cyclohexylamine and Isopropylamine, and the repackaging and storage of Aqua Ammonia.  These chemicals are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and are distributed to numerous customers who utilize these compounds for many applications ranging from water treatment, other chemical manufacturing, to pharmaceutical applications.  The same properties that make these chemic"

It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and local regulations.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the RMP Submit Users Manual 2004, the following elements and their descriptions have been included in this Executive Summary:\n\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nBrenntag -is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as; design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the various processes at the facility.  It is Brenntag's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, Brenntag has thoroughly coordinated response efforts with the Local Fire Dept., which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of a release.\n\n \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Brenntag facility's primary activities encompass distribution of chemical products.  There are currently three (3) regulated substances present at the facility.  These substances include Cyclohexylamine, Isopropylamine and Aqua Ammonia.  The Cyclohexylamine and Isopropylamine are received prepackaged and are only handled for resell to customers and the containers are normally not opened on site.  Aqua ammonia is repackaged from a DOT \"in-transit\" tanker truck to DOT totes.  \n\n\n\nFormaldehyde solution was previously reported as a regulated substance at this facility.  However, in accordance with Chapter 1 of the Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (40 CFR Part 68) 3/09, it has been determined that the partial pressure of Form"

Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe EPA has defined the worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a single vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint.  Chapter 4 of the Risk Management Program Guidance for Chemical Distributors (40 CFR Part 68) 3/09 was used as a guideline for determining the worst-case release for each of the regulated substances.  \n\n\n\nThe weight of the volume of liquid contained in the largest container of each regulated substance was used to determine the release rate.  LFA, LFB and DF values were taken from Exhibit 4-5a tables.  A temperature correction factor (Exhibit 4-6) was chosen for a temperature of 103 deg F, which is the highest daily maximum temperature for the local vicinity over the past three years.  A non-diked pool  was calculated to be 224 square feet assuming the spilled liquid forms a 1 cm deep pool.  This information was used, along with Exhibits provided in the guidance manual, in order to determine the distance to the endpoint.  Based on site topography and satellite photos of the surrounding area, an urban topography was chosen for this facility. \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release calculations for isopropylamine indicate that there are no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint.  This, in addition to no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the last five years, classifies this process as a Program Level 1 regulated substances.  As such, an alternative release scenario (ARS) is not required.   \n\n\n\nThe worst-case release calculations for cyclohexylamine and aqua ammonia indicate that there are potential public (industrial) receptors within the distance to the toxic endpoint.  This, in addition to no accidents with specific offsite consequences within the last five years, classifies both of these processes as a Program L"

The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes that take place within the processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan has been reviewed, coordinated and verified with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBrenntag's safety program is designed to prevent fires, explosions, and accidental chemical releases.  The program requires safety audits, inspection, maintenance programs, and safety training for employees and contract workers.  Facility personnel are always encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and to consider these concerns when designing and implementing process safety systems.\n\n\n\nBrenntag continues to improve its safety record by conducting incident investigations and safety compliance audits.  Brenntag also utilizes continuous training on emergency procedures, and participating in outreach activities, which include: educating and training customers, fire departments, and emergency response teams.  Brenntag practices continuous training of emergency procedures through regular safety meetings, and all incidents and near misses are thoroughly investigated and reviewed by the Health and Safety personnel and the Safety Committee at each facility.\n\n\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of the Brenntag accidental release prevention program.
