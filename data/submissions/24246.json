      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:  Rulison Gas Company's accidental release prevention release policy involves a unified approach that integrates procedures and management practices.  Applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are typically followed.  Rulison Gas Company's emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program requirements.  The goal of Rulison Gas Company's spill policy is to implement appropriate controls to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances.  If such a release does occur, the Facility personnel are prepared to work with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Commission, and other authorities to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  Facility and regulatedsubstances handled:  The primary activity at Parachute Gas Compression and Processing Facility is the handling and compression of natural gas.  In addition, as part of the facility operation, natural gas liquids (NGL) are separated from the natural gas stream, stored on site, and sold.  The flammable regulated chemical mixture at the Facility is NGL, which is an aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.  The flammable regulated chemicals contained in the mixture include methane, ethane, butane, propane, pentane, iso-pentane, and iso-butane.  These regulated chemicals have a regulated threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds (lbs.).  The maximum inventory of NGL at the facility is 30,000 gallons, which contains approximately 120,000 lbs. of regulated flammable chemicals.  Additionally, the Facility has a 210-barrel above ground storage tank which stores natural gas condensate.

      "SummaryText": "vision of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Chemical Emergency Prevention and Preparedness Office of the Environmental Protection Agency was applied for the worst case release scenario (WCRS). The worst case scenario was assumed to be the release of the total quantity of the 30,000 gallon NGL storage tank forming a vapor cloud within the lower and upper flammability limits which detonates.    For flammable substances, the endpoint is overpressure of 1 pound per square inch (psi) for vapor cloud explosions.  Using the flammable endpoint of 1-psi overpressure and the data contained in the RMP*COMPTM program, the WCRS distance was calculated at 0.4 miles from the Facility.  Based on a visual survey of the adjacent properties within a 0.4-mile radius of the facility, the population within the WCRS area is estimated to be four (4).  A single residence is the only public receptor, as defined in 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.4 miles of the Facility.  Environmental receptors, as defined by 40 CFR 68.3, within 0.4 miles of the Facility, were not observed based on review of United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps.  Alternative release scenario:  The alternative release scenario consists of a release of the flammable NGL through a ruptured or otherwise damaged load-out hose.  Based on the EPA's RMP Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis manual, a flammable endpoint distance was calculated at .1 miles from the rupture point.  Process Safety Information and Process Hazard Analysis:  Rulison Gas Company, LLC. maintains a written Emergency Response Plan regarding safety information that describes the chemical hazards associated with regulated substances at the Facility. Further safety information is also detailed in the RMP. In addition, operating procedures and equipment design codes and standards associated with the operations at the Facility are maintained in the RMP at the Facility.

Emergency Response Program:  The Facility has an Emergency Response Program entitled Emergency Response Plan. The Emergency Response Plan describes procedures to minimize hazards to human health and the environment. The Emergency Response Plan includes aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. The Emergency Response Plan also includes procedures for the use of emergency response equipment and its inspection, testing and maintenance. In the event of a NGL accident, first aid procedures for exposure, as well as, procedures to inform authorities and the public are described in the Emergency Response Plan. A general emergency practice drill is performed at least annually and includes an invitation to the appropriate local authorities.  A site map is included in the Emergency Response Plan. This Emergency Response Plan is kept at the Facility separately and should be referenced in the event of a release. The Emergency Response Plan is updated and reviewed as appropriate to reflect changes at the Facility and the covered process and the employees are informed of changes."
