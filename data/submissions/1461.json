              "Description": "The Hobart R.O. Plant utilizes chlorine in the disinfection process of treating potable water. Due to the inherent dangers in handling chlorine a prevention program has been established to reduce the risk to emplyees and the public. This program is comprised of several individual elements all of which are designed with the intent of preventing chlorine gas release. At this plant, the four individual chlorine sytems are similar in that identical equipment is used and procedures are the same. They are both in the same location but different injection points are used. Therefore, they will be considered as the same process. All prevention program elements are in place for each system. The individual elements of the program are as follows.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis.\nA  P.H.A. was conducted on 4/14/99 and 4/15/99 at the Hobart Plant. This analysis determined the hazards present and recommendations were made to reduce the risks associated with the chlorine processes.\n\nOperating Procedures.\nA written set of procedures has been developed to guide the operators of the system on how to startup, shutdown and normally operate the system. Procedures have also been developed to operate in either temporary or emergency conditions. The procedures cover operating limitations, safety and health considerations.\n\nTraining\nAll operators receive initial training on the system and periodic training or refresher training to keep current with procedures and equipment. Each operator is trained with regard to the process, limitations, emergency response procedures, hazards and accepted work practices. All operators are tested to verify knowledge of the above.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nThis program documents the maintenance and inspection portion of the program. It insures that proper construction and materials have been used in installations with hazardous materials.\n\nManagement of Change\nAny change in the process, from materials to procedures, must undergo an evaluation or review prior to implementing in order to prevent accidents. Any changes must be documented.\n\nPrestartup Review\nAlthough similar to management of change, this element is designed more towards new or modified processes. The new process undergoes a review to insure design specifications meet applicable codes construction standards.\n\nCompliance Audits\nEvery three years audits are conducted to verify that all program elements are in place and being implemented.\n\nIncident Investigations\nAny incidents that may have resulted in an emergenc y situation must be reviewed. This investigation shall include corrective action, communication to staff and documentation of all findings.\n\nEmployee Participation\nAll employees will have access to the RMP information and are encouraged to participate in the decision making process.\n\nHot Work Permit\nAny welding or brazing process near a regulated process must be formally authorized and permitted.\n\nContractors\nBefore contractor selection , an evaluation of the contractors' safety program must be completed. Contractors' safety performance must be demonstrated through injury logs, training programs, etc.  A well defined procedure explaining contractor responsibilities concerning emergency action procedures must be followed.",

The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a commodity also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary exposure, reduce the threat to the community and co-workers. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal, State and Local rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine, safety devices in the design of the facility, safe handling procedures and training of personnel\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon the facility's chlorine standard operating procedures, emergency procedures and the Indian River County Emergency Plan for Hazardous materials. The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the local fire authority and notification of the potentially affected neighbors.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substance handled.\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to provide potable water to the surrounding community. Chlorine gas is used during the treatment process to disinfect the water. Chlorine is delivered to the plant by semi truck and unloaded.  Plant operators then load the cylinders by stationary crane, the cylinder onto a scale. The cranes are tested and certified on an annual basis. Plant personnel are the only authorized people to enter this area. The facility currently has an inventory of 24,000 lbs. of chlorine.\n\nWorst case release scenario.\nThe worst case of a chlorine leak would be a complete failure of a 1-ton cylinder. The release would be the entire contents or 2,000 lbs. in a ten minute period.  It is assumed that all chlorine released would be in a gaseous form.\n\nThe alternate release scenario\nThe alternate release scenario is one in which a more likely type of failure could occur. For this facility it would involve a vacuum line break.\n\nAccidental Release prevention program.\nThis wate"

The Indian River County Emergency Services Division will be conducting release drills on a biannual basis.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\nPeriodic reviews and evaluations by plant staff and engineers insure up to date procedures and equipment. Currently, Indian River County Utility Services is conducting a feasibility study to determine the possible use of an alternate form of water disinfection."
