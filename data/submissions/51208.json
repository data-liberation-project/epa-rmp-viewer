In this concentrated form, such products present increased hazards and regulatory scrutiny. Notably our formaldehyde 37% and hydrofluoric acid 70%; held in aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) at our facility. The exact locations and quantities of these stored products are on file with several agencies including the State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning Committee and Fire Department. \n\nAcid Products ?Qualifies? as a EPA RMP Program 3 facility, per 40 CFR 68.10(d)(1), and is also subject to OSHA's PSM standard for the same two products(i.e, formaldehyde 37% and hydrofluoric acid 70%). Since the worst-case accidental release endpoints extend slightly beyond the property, and could affect surrounding public receptors should an incident occur. \n\nAcid Products employs numerous safety precautions, and maintains various written operating procedures that provide clear instructions and steps for safely conducting activities associated with each covered process consistent with the best industry practices.
