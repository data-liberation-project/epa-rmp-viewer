Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we manufacture gaseous and liquid hydrogen.  Natural gas and steam are used in the manufacturing process to produce hydrogen. Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in processing part of the gaseous hydrogen stream and also to liquefy carbon dioxide at the facility.  Liquid Chlorine is used for cooling water treatment, specifically as a biocide.  Ammonia, chlorine, and the flammable mixture used to produce hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit. \n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.

In the reformer furnace, the feedstock and steam are heated in the presence of a catalyst to approximately 1,500 degrees F, where a chemical reaction takes place that converts the mixture into hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are than separated from the hydrogen. The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to our customers via pipeline or sent to a liquefier where the gas is cooled and stored as a liquid for delivery to our customers via tank truck. \n\nLiquid anhydrous ammonia is used to cool part of the gaseous hydrogen stream to control the dewpoint and in the production of liquid carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide is a by product of the hydrogen production process).\n\nLiquid Chlorine is used for cooling water treatment, specifically as a biocide.  The chlorine is stored in 1-ton containers, two of which are located on site.\n\n 3.  The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distance for each reported scenario:\n\nThe toxic worst-case scenario (WCS), as defined by the EPA, associated with anhydrous ammonia  is a catastrophic failure of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank releasing all 47,000 pounds over a ten minute period. The maximum distance to the EPA-defined endpoint (0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm) for this WCS reaches receptors offsite.  Although we have other active mitigation systems directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.  Chlorine was considered for the WCS but it was determined that ammonia had a longer distance to reach the EPA defined endpoint.\n\nThe alternative case scenario (ACS) for the anhydrous ammonia is a break in, or sudden unco"

The EPA defined endpoint is 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm for this event.  No passive mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this ACS.\n\nAnother alternative case (ACS) scenario for a toxic substance at this facility is the failure of a 3/8 inch vapor line connected to a chlorine ton container as a result of mechanical damage or corrosion.  The entire inventory of the vessel and line is assumed to be released (2000 lbs).  The chlorine will form a cloud, which reaches receptors offsite.\n\nThe flammables worst-case scenario (WCS), as defined by the EPA, associated with a catastrophic failure of the liquid hydrogen storage tank, releasing all 570,000 gallons (330,000 pounds) of liquid hydrogen. The total quantity of hydrogen is assumed to form a vapor cloud and ignite resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE).

Five-year accident history:\n\nIn the last five years there have been no accidents involving, or accidental releases of flammable gas,chlorine, or ammonia that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site; or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n \n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nThe facility\u00bfs emergency response program is based upon OSHA\u00bfs HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from the LEPC and outside agencies.  They have been trained to OSHA\u00bfs Specialist or Technician Level.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the  New Orleans Fire Department and its Hazmat Team for fires related to the flammable and or toxic processes.
