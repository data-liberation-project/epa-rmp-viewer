      "SummaryText": "The Facility maintains two separate ammonia refrigeration systems which contain a total of approximately 32,100 pounds of ammonia:  27,799 pounds in the +38 degree F Room and 4,300 pounds in the -10 degree F Room. The systems are closed loops and little or no ammonia is needed annually to replenish minor losses due to routine maintenance or to sustain a milk and nut cooler, a -10 degree F freezer unit, plant process water coolers and Facility air conditioners.\n\nThe receiver tanks for both systems are equipped with both sight glasses and pressure gauges. The pressure relief valve setting on the tanks is 250 psig, and the vent is to the roof with an appropriate diffuser. The mechanical rooms where the receivers are located are equipped with ammonia sensors. At 50 ppm, the sensors activate emergency exhaust fans. At 100 ppm, the sensors activate plant wide alarms and the system compressors are automatically shut down. Shutdown allows the ammonia in the system to migrate to the cold spots within the system. The sensors are replaced annually. The sensors are adjusted every 90 days and span adjusted and calibrated every 6 months.\n\nUpon activation of the ammonia detection alarm, employees are to proceed to the employee cafeteria. Personnel have been instructed to wait for further instructions from plant management. \n\nBoth refrigeration systems are visually inspected daily by the operators. In addition to the ammonia sensors, there are either equipment electric panel lights or computer monitoring readings for temperature, pressure and/or liquid level on all pressurized elements of the systems. Vessels are equipped with pressure relief valves vented to the roof of the building. An ammonia dump fire access panel is mounted on the exterior wall of each mechanical room. A fire hose can be affixed to the panel, and the ammonia charge can be dumped and mixed with water on discharge. \n\nAn emergency action plan has been developed and has been coordinated with the Corsicana Fire Dep"

      "SummaryText": "artment. The Facility has arrangements with the Corsicana Fire Department to provide response in emergencies. The Fire Department has been made familiar with the Facility and the ammonia refrigeration systems. \n\nThe system and its safeguards, along with Russell Stover employees' professional approach to prevent accidents with this and other chemicals used at their Facility, has proven to be very effective at attaining a record of very few releases and minimal amounts of chemical lost during an emergency event. In the past five years, Russell Stover has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that resulted in any onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage, evacuations, or shelterings in place. It is the focus of Russell Stover to maintain that record and look into ways to improve the engineering, operations, and training of employees whenever possible. \n"
