Dole Atwater has a policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also required to inform Dole of any hazards they may introduce at the site. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nDole Atwater has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases due to the site's release prevention policies. There have been no accidental releases from Dole Atwater within the last 5 years with offsite impact (deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place). There have been no onsite injuries, which required medical treatment. Three anhydrous ammonia release events have occurred, one event involved the release 326 pounds, the second event involved the release of 514, and the third 477 pounds.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\nDole Atwater utilizes a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, sheltering-in-place, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, Dole Atwater emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place that would require a modified emergency response.  Dole Atwater also coordinates our plans and actions with local agencies which provide Dole Atwater with additional emergency response capability.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nImproving safety is a continuous process at Dole Atwater.

Anhydrous ammonia inventory on site was reduced by the replacement of the anhydrous ammonia storage tank supplying the waste water system with a smaller tank.  Standard Operating Procedures were rewritten and include equipment specific lock out/ tag out information, pictures and drawings of equipment.  3200 pages were written in standard format for ease of use by operators.\n\nStructural seismic upgrades, materials of construction upgrades, installing additional process instrumentation and/or process controls, and conducting Hazard Awareness training are typical of currently planned changes to improve safety at the facility."

This commitment is demonstrated by Dole Atwater's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the Dole site in Atwater, California. It is Dole Atwater's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. Dole Atwater is also committed to responding to emergencies resulting from accidental releases in order to mitigate the release and any associated consequences.\n\nThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nThe primary activity at Dole Atwater is processing fresh fruit.  Dole Atwater has one regulated substance, anhydrous ammonia present at the site.  The anhydrous ammonia is used in two refrigeration processes to freeze the packaged fruit and one waste water process to control pond pH.\n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Dole Atwater site has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the site.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nDole Atwater maintains detailed records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes. Examples include; Material Safety Data Sheets, piping and instrumentation diagrams, and, equipment specification sheets.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nDole Atwater conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with the covered processes are identified and effectively controlled. The \u00c2\u00bfwhat-if checklist\u00c2\u00bf methodology is primarily used to carry out these analyse"

Any findings related to the hazard analysis, where a response is required, are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within Dole Atwater's covered processes, written operating procedures are maintained. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nDole Atwater has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures and safe work practices associated with these processes. Refresher training is provided at least once every 3 years, and more frequently as needed, for required process and safety topics.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nDole Atwater carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, critical instruments, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps. Qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices are utilized to carry out appropriate maintenance. These personnel are also offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Dole Atwater to safely manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nDole Atwater conducts audits of compliance systems for RMP requirements on a regular basis. These audits are carried out at least once every 3 years by a team of qualified personnel. Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are tracked to ensure resolution in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nDole Atwater promptly and carefully investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nDole Atwater truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. The site has safety teams, which involve employees as leaders in facilitating team efforts. In addition, Dole Atwater employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.
