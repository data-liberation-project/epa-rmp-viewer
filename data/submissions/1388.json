If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire company, or other authorities, to mitigate the release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  Facility Information \n\n-  This facility retails anhydrous ammonia to farmers for nitrogen fertilization.\n\n-  The maximum quanity stored would be 177,581 pounds of anhydrous ammonia stored in one 26,000 gallon tank,  and one 12,000- gallon tank.\n\n3.  The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\na.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank  released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 121,503 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.09 miles.\n\nb.  The alternative release scenario based on the  the most likley potential incident is a release from a break in a pipe.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is .41 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia of  the American National Standards Institute, Inc.  We are also guided by the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  The Five-year Accident History -\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, and evacuations, sheltering in place,"

The emergency response program\n\n- The facility has:\n\na.  a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38.\nb.  provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.   There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time but additional upgrades of the safety equipment are planned in the near future."
