EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nKMCO, LP is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for KMCO workers, the public, and the environment. KMCO provides tolling services to their customers. These services include Distillations and Chemical Processing and Manufacturing. AS part of this commitment, KMCO has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility. One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at KMCO. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP rule and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at KMCO. \r\n\r\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nKMCO is committed to the safety of KMCO workers and the public, and the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. KMCO implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous substances. In the event of a significant accidental release, our trained Emergency Response personnel will respond in order to control and contain such releases. KMCO evaluates each situation, evacuates workers as necessary, and contact the local emergency response organizations to prevent and/or reduce the consequences of the release, if/when necessary. \r\n\r\n1.2 KMCO and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nKMCO handles five listed toxic substances by the RMP rule in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule:\r\n\r\nEthylene oxide stored for use in customer tolling processes. KMCO also handles Propylene Oxide, formalin (formaldehyde solution), and Ethylenediamine. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the use of regulated substances at KMCO the following toxic chemicals are covered by the RMP rule:\r\n\r\nTolling Processes for a variety of customers. All are regulated under EPA RMP Program  3. \r\nEthylene Oxide ---185,000 lbs."

Max storage/on-site for processing\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are no RMP listed flammables at the facility.\r\n\r\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\n\r\nKMCO performed off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could potentially affect \r\n\r\nKMCO performed off-site consequence analysis (OCA) to estimate the potential for an accidental release of a regulated substance that could potentially affect the public or the environment. The OCA consists of evaluating both worst-case scenarios (WCS's) and alternative release scenarios (ARSs). KMCO does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An ARS represents a release that might occur during the lifetime of a facility like KMCO. ARSs help the LEPC improve the community emergency response plan. We have shared that information with the LEPC and other organizations involved in emergency response activities. It is also available to the public. If you are interested in this information, please contact our RMP Coordinator at (281) 28-3501.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of performing the OCA is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the endpoint distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effect should be greater; at distances greater than the endpoint distance, the effects would be less. \r\n\r\nWorst-case Release Scenario\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is failure of a tank car containing 168,200 pounds of Ethylene Oxide (EO).  As stated above, KMCO does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. The computer-modeling program used was DEGADIS Ver. 2.1. The scenario is based on the following: the product i"

Although there are mitigation measures, such as deluge systems at the tank car rail spur(s),the model was done with no mitigation measures to determine a worst case scenario that could include city waste service interruptions or low pressure. The calculation resulted in an estimated distance to an endpoint as: 6.81 miles. Since this facility is located in a populated are, the toxic cloud formed by the release would reach offsite public receptors. \r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenarios for EPA RMP Listed Toxics\r\n\r\nAgain, DEGADIS Version 2.1 was utilized to calculate the release scenarios, except for Sulfur Dioxide and Formaldehyde Solution. \r\n\r\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2) - an alternative scenario could be a rupture of a two (2) inch diameter liquid unloading pipe during transfer from a one-ton storage cylinder to a process vessel, with no mitigation measures. With material liquefied under pressure and a release duration of 10 minutes, the estimated distance to toxic endpoint was 0.50 miles. \r\n\r\nEthylene Oxide - an alternative scenario could be a rupture of a two (2) inch diameter liquid unloading pipe from a tank car to the storage tank.

Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to information created as part of the KMCO plant accident prevention program. In addition, KMCO has a number of initiates under way that address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include a Saf"

Once again, t he team findings are forwarded to appropriate personnel for consideration and the final resolution f the findings is documented and retained. \r\n\r\nOperating procedures\r\n\r\nKMCO is ISO 9002 certified. KMCO maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unity startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process. \r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, KMCO ha implemented a training program for employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in KMCO plant operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g. through skill demonstration, etc. ) having adequate knowledge to perform the duties and task in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. IN addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All of this training"

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, KMCO has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, 94) understand what they should do in the even of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform KMCO plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work. \r\n\r\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\r\n\r\nKMCO conducts a PSSRA for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specification and that all-supporting systems are operationally ready. \r\n\r\nMechanical integrity\r\n\r\nKMCO has practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition. The basic aspects of this program include. (1) conducting training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures. \r\n\r\nWritten procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended, and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency befo"

Examples of these include (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous materials before process piping or equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e. hot work), and (5) a permit and procedure to ensure that adequate precautions are in place before entry into a confined space. These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. \r\n\r\nManagement of Change\r\n\r\nKMCO has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires that changes to items such as a process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process being implemented. Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided with any necessary training on the change. \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nKMCO investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incide"

The investigation team documents its finding, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to the HSE Department for filing, recommendations are tracked until they are complete. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nCompliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years under PSM and will also be conducted under the RMP Rule. Both hourly and management personnel may participate as audit team members and typically a third-party consultant is hired to assist in the audit. The audit team develops finding that are forwarded to KMCO plant management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's finding are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained. \r\n\r\nChemical -specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nThe processes at KMCO have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation. The prevention program summarized previously is applied to all Program 3 EPA RMP - covered processes at KMCO. Collectively these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by (1) equipment failure, and (2) human errors. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the accident prevention program activities, KMCO has safety features on many units to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used in various processes:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n* Ethylene Oxide detectors\r\n* Process alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n* Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\r\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (Manual or automated)\r\n* Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g. high level, high temperature)\r\n* Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n* Redundant equipmen"

KMCO workers will respond to minor events that do not have the potential for significant effect (e.g. small fires or small leaks). In the event of a larger fire or release, workers and contractors may evacuate the area if nec3ssary and contact the local fire department. The emergency response team (ERT) is trained to respond to larger fires and releases. Their ERT training includes annual Fire School training at Texas A&M (TEEX). \r\n\r\nKMCO has established a written emergency response plan that has been communicated to local emergency response officials through the local fire department. Regular dialogue is maintained between KCMO and the Fire Chief and Department via one full-time employee that is a member of the Volunteer Fire Department, and KMCO is a member of the Local Mutual Aid Organizations, Mutual Aid Mont Belveau (MAMB).\r\n\r\n1.7 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nKMCO strives to improve the safety of KMCO processes through periodic safety reviews, the incident investigation program, and a program soliciting safety suggestions from the workers.
