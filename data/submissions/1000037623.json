This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  We coordinate our response efforts with the Prosper Fire Department, which provides additional emergency response expertise and the Cass County LEPC.\r\n\r\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\nOur facility\u00bfs primary activities include support services for crop production.  We have anhydrous ammonia stored in one 30,000-gallon tank, and one 18,000-gallon tank at our facility in Prosper, North Dakota (Figure 1).  The maximum amount stored is 48,000 gallons (209,957 pounds).   The largest single storage vessel at our facility contains 131,223 pounds at 85% standard maximum storage capacity.\r\n\r\n3.
