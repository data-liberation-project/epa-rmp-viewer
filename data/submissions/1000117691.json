These packaged containers include pails, drums, totes, and tankers. \n\nThe containers are stored in secured areas to prevent accidental damage and in an area away from equipment traffic and chemicals that may, during an incident, contribute to a release from these containers. Only authorized and trained personnel are permitted to handle the containers. \n\nAqua ammonia arrives at the facility by tanker and is repackaged into 55-gal drums or totes. The drums are palletized and single or double stacked in an area with limited access away from traffic. \n\nIsopropylamine arrives at the facility by tanker and is repackaged into 55-gal drums or bulked into a single above ground storage tank. Only senior, experienced operators can work with the isopropylamine. The drums are palletized, single or double stacked in an area with limited access away from traffic, and made to order, no drum storage for stock. \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has an aggressive accidental release prevention program that is based upon employee training, chemical safety awareness, equipment and facility management. \n\nTraining includes both the classroom environment and observation by management to verify competency. Classes are designed to achieve maximum results within the time period on an annual basis. Knowledge is evaluated by both verbal questioning for some classes during the training and some classes have written tests. Attendance is mandatory for all employees including packagers, maintenance, drivers, and warehouse personnel and verified by both the Director of Environmental, Health, Safety & Quality and the HR Manager. \n\nNew employees are required to receive an extensive orientation to the operating procedures for each phase of the operation including Hazard Communication, Hazardous Material Transportation, Chemicals & Personal Hygiene, Forklift, Personal Protection Equipment, Respiratory Training, Site Security,"

Documentation includes the chemical inventory of regulated substances, the container types and storage conditions, maximum amounts at the site during the year, average daily amounts and the number of days on site. \n\nIn addition, site descriptions, drawings of the facility, locations within the facility of each chemical, surface area, equipment locations as well as emergency equipment are included in the documents. \n\nThe emergency response and contingency plan developed and coordinated with local responders includes a description of emergency response equipment on site, contacts names and phone numbers, procedures for public notice, guidelines for notifying emergency response agencies and personnel, information gathering forms and methods and reports that must be completed and filed with regulatory agencies. \n\nThe emergency response team is 40-hour HAZWOPER certified in response techniques.

      "SummaryText": "d reduce the risks associated with handling chemical products. \n\nChemsolv initiated a major improvement to its risk management through the implementation of a Chemsolv Safe Work Permits & Preliminary Risk Analysis (PRA) on 9/28/2018 that utilizes a checklist format and consolidates all work permits under one system. It asks the same questions that a thorough job briefing would ask, but in a systematic way by guiding through the major hazards in a checklist form. We review the checklist at the work site and mark which hazards are present. Yellow hazards must be addressed during the completion of the step by step job plan, Red hazards require the completion of the appropriate work permit. The permits are basically additional checklists for the special hazards that are identified. The step by step plan analyzes the work for the hazards of each step. The hazards are identified and what will be done to control them. These are assigned to an individual and then we re-evaluate and decide if the hazards are adequately controlled. The PRA is required for all non-routine work, requires two people to issue and release, and allows us to systematically identify and control hazards in the workplace. This system does not change the original prohibition of \"No hot work near any covered process\" but emphasizes and enforces this safeguard to include ALL flammable processes. \n\nPlan updates are the result of coordination with local responders, inspections by regulatory agencies, training sessions, process changes, and new risk management programs and regulations enacted by the government. \n\nPresently all areas are being studied to identify technically, procedurally and economically feasible passive and active risk management strategies to further enhance the safe operation of the facility."
