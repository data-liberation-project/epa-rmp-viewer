              "Description": "MECHANICAL INTEGRITY-\nMAINTENANCE AND     INSPECTION\nPROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Town Of Smyrna's W.W.T.P. Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide feeders are a basic, simple and almost foolproof Vacuum feed system.  The only devices absolutely essential for the safe operation of the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide process is the Vacuum Regulators mounted directly on each cylinder.  If this device is operational, there is no possibility of a \"Catastrophic\" , \"Serious\" or even \"Moderate\" Chlorine or Sulfur Dioxide release into the environment.\n    \n1.    Procedures to establish mechanical integrity of the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide process equipment:\n            \n    (a).    All Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide cylinders will be inspected at delivery for signs of corrosion or abuse.  Each cylinder shall be clean and a fresh coat of paint with no exposed metal.  The valves shall be inspected and be in good condition.  All cylinders not meeting the above inspection shall be returned on the horse that brung them and a replacement ordered immediately.       \n\n    (b).    The Vacuum Regulators and Vacuum lines, (and associated valves), shall be inspected during each cylinder hook up.   \n                                 \n    (c).    The Vacuum Regulators shall be rebuilt annually, and a spare kept on site for use during the rebuild.  The plastic vacuum lines shall be replaced annually.        \n\n    (d).    The vent lines shall be inspected annually.\n    \n    (e).    The scales shall be calibrated annually. \n                             \n    (f).    The Water Pressure Regulator and Backflow preventer shall be inspected annually.              \n\n2.    The Maintenance Supervisor (Lloyd Johnson), has been trained in the Vacuum Regulators rebuild process.  He and all Class IV operators shall continually train on procedures applicable to the job tasks, hazards and safety procedures involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide process equipment.  \n\n\n*\"Catastrophic\" , \"Serious\" or even \"Moderate\" definition:\n See \"Chlorine Emergency Action Plan - Smyrna WasteWater Treatment Plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         \n3.    Annually the Maintenance Supervisor shall oversee the Vacuum Regulator rebuild and enter a report to the Maintenance file of the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide feeders and a copy to the W.W.T.P. Operations Manager.  This report shall include:\n\n    (a).    The date and the name of the person who performed the Vacuum Regulator rebuild         \n\n    (b).    The part numbers and source of the rebuild kit, vacuum lines and any other equipment used during the rebuild.  \n\n\n4.    No new equipment shall be used in the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide process without first receiving written approval from the W.W.T.P. Operations Manager, or the Design Engineer,  to ensure that any changes are suitable for the in the Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide process.  These procedures are to ensure that all changes in technology and facilities are appropriately reviewed in accordance with the \"Management of Change Rules\", 29 C.F.R. ?1910.119(l)",
