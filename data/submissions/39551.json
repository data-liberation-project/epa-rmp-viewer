This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM, RMP, and CalARP regulations and to ensure that the plan is kept current.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe U.S. Growers facility is located on East Vernon Ave (North side) between Alameda and Santa Fe Ave., Vernon California . The facility consists of two main warehouses that use ammonia for refrigeration  Areas 5 and 6, and an engine room. The facility occupies approximately 167,00 square feet.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration process is a closed system that cycle the refrigerant, or ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again.  The processes, consisting of vessels, piping, valves, and process equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for product and process equipment.\n\nChanges in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature; lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature.  Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat.  Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system to vaporize.  Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid.  Typical operating conditions range from approximately 7 inches Hg on the low pressure side of the system to 160 psig on the high side.  The ammonia equipment and its location is listed in Table 1.\nTable 1 Ammonia Refrigeration Equipment\n\n\t\tEquipment\t\t\t\tLocation\t\t\tState\n\n\tHigh Pressure Receiver\t\t\tRoof of Machine Room\t\t\tLiquid\n\tIntercooler\t\t\t\tMachine Room\t\t\t\tLiq/Vapor\n\tPump Traps (2)\t\t\t\tMachine Room\t\t\t\tLiq/Vapor\n\tEvaporator Coils\t\t\t1-4: -10 D F Freezer Room\t\tLiq/Vapor\n\t\t\t\t\t\t5-10: Loading Dock\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t11-14: Passage Way, Loading & RR Dock\n\t\t\t\t\t\t15-17:   Passage Way, Loading & R"

The capacity of the high pressure receiver is 1100 gallons of ammonia, which equates to 6050 pounds of ammonia.  The receiver is located on the roof of the facility, and thus, no passive mitigation effects were considered.  The most pessimistic meteorological conditions were used; 1.5 meters/second wind speed, and F stability.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determin the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n?\tDistance to Toxic Endpoint: 1.0 miles, based on EPA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\n\nAlternative Release Result Summary\n?\tScenario Description:  A release of ammonia gas from \u00bc inch diameter leak.  The release rate of ammonia due to the pressure of the tank is 126 pounds per minute.  No passive mitigation effects wee taken into account, as this rupture could occur outside.  The meteorological conditions used were 3 meters per second wind speed, and D stability.  The EPA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants was used to determine the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\n?\tDistance to Toxic Endpoint: 0.1 miles, based on the EPA\u00bfs RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS.\n\nU.S. Growers has a Process Safety Man"

These safety features include ammonia sensors in the machine room as well as sensors in selected cold storage areas.  In addition, the majority of the ammonia is maintained inside the engine room and just outside of the machine room (condensers).\n\nIn addition to the Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility will operate in accordance with the International Institute of Amonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.
