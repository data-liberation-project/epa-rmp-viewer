              "Description": "The Dibrom process has been designed to prevent the release of bromine. The bromine storage tank is located within a 300-square foot concrete dike with 4-foot walls for containment. The storage tank is equipped with a high-level alarm and reductant shut-down systems that will automatically shut off supply of bromine to ensure that the level is maintained below maximum volume. The process is continually monitored and bromine monitors are located within the process and around the perimeter to detect and provide an early warning for bromine vapors. The presence will set off an audible alarm. A smaller bromine storage tank was put into service January 2011 and the RMP was updated for this reason. ",

              "Description": "The Fortress (chlorethoxyfos) process has been designed to prevent the release of chlorine and hydrogen sulfide. The process is continually monitored and the equipment has been constructed according to recognized and accepted codes and regulatory standards. Chlorine is delivered in 2,000-pound cylinders and, within a secured, covered structure that provides protection from extreme heat and direct sunlight, are stored in racks capable of holding 12 cylinders. Stationary chlorine sensors surround areas of chlorine usage (within the process and around the perimeter) to detect releases and provide an early warning for either chlorine or H2S vapors. This includes the chlorine storage area and the chlorine charging area. These sensors will activate alarms if unsafe levels are detected. Control room operators monitor this and will initiate response if necessary. The chlorine delivery system is equipped with automatic emergency shut-off devices actuated by a signal from dedicated local chlorine sensors. The system also includes a shut-off valve in the chlorine line to the reactor that will not open unless the upstream pressure is greater than the downstream pressure (backflow prevention).  Rupture discs are provided to prevent piping from rupture due to hydrostatic pressure buildup between blocked valves.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmvac has not produced Fortress (chlorethoxyfos) since 2013 and will update all procedures, training, and PHA before next production campaign.",

              "Description": "The METAM/KPAM processes have been designed to prevent the release of carbon disulfide or methylamine. The carbon disulfide storage tank is located within a 6,080-square foot concrete dike with a 2.5-foot wall for containment. The carbon disulfide storage tank is equipped a high-level alarm that will automatically close valves in the unload line. The process is continually monitored. The unload pump will shut down upon low flow conditions (dry run protection). Loss of instrument air, electricity, or nitrogen will also result in shutdown of unloading operations. Temperature indicators will alarm if high temperature boundaries are met. Area monitors are present to detect vapor releases, which will activate alarms located in the control room. Vapors are routed through a scrubber and then to a vent gas incinerator for emission control. As an additional measure, operators maintain 3 ? 4 inches of water in the containment dike. Since carbon disulfide is heavier than water, this ensures that any leaks of carbon disulfide will be submersed in water to minimize vaporization. The MMA storage tanks are located within a concrete dike for containment and have been pre-charged with water. Both MMA storage tanks are equipped with a high-level alarm and have pressure switches capable of shutting down pumps associated with the tanks. Area monitors are present to detect vapor releases, which will activate alarms located in the control room. Temperature sensors will activate an alarm if high temperature boundaries are exceeded. Both tanks are equipped with a fire suppression system, capable of soaking the area with a water and foam mixture. The MMA discharge valves are equipped with fusable links which will disconnect the air supply in the event of a fire allowing the valves to fail closed.  ",

              "Description": "The DMCAA process includes the use of chlorine as a raw material. Chlorine is delivered in 2,000-pound cylinders and, within a secured, covered structure that provides protection from extreme heat and direct sunlight, are stored in racks capable of holding 12 cylinders. Stationary chlorine sensors surround areas of chlorine usage to detect releases. These sensors will detect any release, and activate alarms if unsafe levels are detected. Control room operators monitor this and initiate response if necessary. The chlorine delivery system is equipped with automatic emergency shut-off devices actuated by a signal from dedicated local chlorine sensors. The delivery system also includes a shutoff valve in the chlorine line to the reactor which will not open unless the upstream pressure is greater than the downstream pressure (backflow prevention). Rupture discs are provided to prevent piping from rupture due to hydrostatic pressure buildup between blocked valves.",

The plan has been prepared in accordance with the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Rule 40 CFR Part 68. RMP requires facilities that use extremely hazardous substances to develop a Risk Management Plan. These plans must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five years. \n\n\n\nThe Amvac facility was originally a portion of the Dupont Manufacturing Center (Now FMC). It was purchased from Dupont by Amvac on 5-18-2001. Amvac is considered a tenant on the FMC (formerly Dupont) site at Axis Alabama. All site Emergency Response is mutually shared and coordinated by the emergency response teams from both companies. \n\n\n\nAmvac's Axis facility receives steam, fire water, process water, potable water and air from the FMC (formerly Dupont) facility. Amvac's facility consists of various buildings, chemical reactors, above ground storage tanks and vessels (inside containment), truck loading/unloading stations, railcar unloading stations and various ancillary equipment. \n\n\n\nThe Amvac Axis facility has a North American industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code of 32532 for Pesticide and Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing. The plant manufactures pesticides which require the handling of Acutely Hazardous Materials in quantities which make them subject to the Risk Management Rule requirements of the Clean Air Act (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\n40 CFR 68.190 outlines requirements for submitting updates to the RMP. Amvac's most recent submittal was certified and sent to EPA on February 21, 2017. Amvac's 5 Year Anniversary date is currently February 21, 2022. This is the date by which the next full RMP re-submission must be completed. \n\n\n\nThe listed Toxic substances include:\n\n1.    Chlorine; CAS# 7782-50-5 used in Fortress (chlorethoxyfos) and DMCAA processes\n\n2.    Phosphorus Trichloride; CAS# 7719-12-2 used in Fortress (chlorethoxyfos), K500 and Phosphite processes\n\n3.

As per 40 CFR 68.22 (c) and because AMVAC uses the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance through RMP*Comp, AMVAC has evaluated the worst case release analyses with RMP*Comp assumptions of 25 degrees C and 50% humidity as values for the temperature and humidity variables. Per 40 CFR 68.22(g), the highest maximum temperature at Mobile regional Airport since 2015 was used for the temperature of the released substance.  That temperature occurred on July 19, 2015, with a reading of 98 degrees F. This information was obtained from Corey Bunn, Meteorologist at Coastal Weather Research Center, Mobile Alabama. \n\n\n\nThe one worst case release scenario that is estimated to create the greatest distance to an endpoint for toxicity is from the release of carbon disulfide. Assumptions for this scenario include a complete release of the contents of the carbon disulfide (CS2) storage tank (V303). Carbon Disulfide is loaded from iso-containers and railcars into V303. \n\n\n\nRMP*Comp input parameters for worst case scenario modeling include 315,000 pounds of carbon disulfide released into its surrounding concrete dike of 6,080 square feet and 2.5 ft. wall, and maximum temperature of 98 degrees F. The resulting distance in any direction to an endpoint was calculated to be 5.0 miles. This distance is at least a half-mile further to a toxic endpoint than any other RMP-regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nAn e"

      "SummaryText": "vent of this nature is very unlikely due to process controls described in this report. There are several safeguards in place to prevent a scenario such as this. Level alarms associated with the carbon disulfide storage tank will alarm on high level and will automatically close valves in the unload line. The unload pump will shut down on low flow (dry run protection) and loss of instrument air, electricity or nitrogen will also result in shutdown of unloading operations.  Temperature indicators will alarm if high temperature boundaries are met. Area monitors are present to detect vapor release, and they will activate alarms located in the control room. Vapors are routed through a scrubber and then to a vent gas incinerator for emission control. As an additional measure, operators maintain 3 - 4 inches of water in the V303 containment dike. Since carbon disulfide is heavier than water, this ensures that any leaks of carbon disulfide will be submersed in water to minimize vaporization.\n\n\n\nAn alternate release scenario for carbon disulfide (CS2) is one that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario. This would be a leak that develops in the CS2 transfer line from the storage tank to the reactor. It takes approximately 50 minutes to transfer CS2 into the reactor. Assuming a leak rate of 4 gallons per minute and 50 minutes release time, this leak would result in 200 gallons of carbon disulfide spilling onto the concrete floor. RMP*Comp dispersion model was used for this alternative scenario. A total of 200 gallons (2,080 pounds) of carbon disulfide were released, and the estimated downwind distance to the toxic endpoint was 0.2 miles. There are no public receptors within this area.\n\n\n\nThe 104,000-pound bromine storage tank (V126) is surrounded by a concrete dike size of 300 square feet, with 4-foot walls, and is equipped with a high-level alarm and reductant shut-down systems that will automatically shut off supply of bromine to ensure that the level is maintai"

The presence will set off an audible alarm.\n\n\n\nAn alternate release scenario for bromine would be from a process pipe leak, from failures at a flange or weld. It takes approximately 16 hours to charge bromine into the reactor. It is assumed that such a leak would result in 20 gallons of bromine released during the transfer (0.527 pounds per minute) from the storage tank into the reactor. At 26 pounds per gallon, this would be 500 pounds of bromine released. According to RMP*Comp, the estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.1 miles. There are no public receptors within this area.\n\n\n\nThe Phosphorus Trichloride storage tank (VP162 @ 132,000 pounds) is within a concrete dike of 855 square feet, with 4-foot walls. The equipment has been constructed according to recognized and accepted codes and regulatory standards. Process vents are controlled in a closed vent system that vents to an onsite gas incinerator.\n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario for a phosphorus trichloride release is a process pipe leak in the transfer line from the storage tank to the reactor, which takes about 5.75 hours. It was assumed that 200 gallons of phosphorus trichloride were released during this time. RMP*Comp results indicated an estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is <0.1 miles.

The chlorine delivery system is equipped with automatic emergency shut-off devices actuated by a signal from dedicated local chlorine sensors. The system also includes a shut-off valve in the chlorine line to the reactor which will not open unless the upstream pressure is greater than the downstream pressure (backflow prevention). Rupture discs are provided to prevent piping from rupture due to hydrostatic pressure buildup between blocked valves.\n\n\n\nThe alternate scenario for a chlorine release is a process pipe leak from failure at the load flange, resulting in 150 pounds of chlorine released to atmosphere. Typical charging time is about 200 minutes (0.75 pounds per minute). According to RMP*Comp, an estimated distance to the toxic endpoint is less than 0.1 miles. There are no alternate scenarios having toxic endpoints offsite. \n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Case Scenario and Alternative Case Scenario for covered Flammable Substances:\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Release Scenario and Alternate Case scenario for Flammable Substances are presented for Methylamine (CAS#74-89-5), which is classified as a flammable substance in Table 3 of 40 CFR 68 and is used as a raw material in the Metam/Kpam process. Methylamine (MMA) is offloaded from railcars, in gaseous state into storage tanks V301 and V302, which have been pre-charged with water. The capacity of the railcar is 160,000 pounds of anhydrous MMA. The MMA storage tanks are located within a concrete dike for containment. The worst case scenario would be a complete release of the contents of the railcar. Using RMP*Comp, an estimate of 160,000 pounds (vapor cloud explosion) with wind speed of 1.5 m/s and stability class G, @ 77F (25C), resulted in an estimated impact distance of 0.4 miles. The wind speed, temperature and stability class are assumptions used by RMP*Comp. \n\n\n\nAn "

Both tanks are equipped with a fire suppression system, capable of soaking the area with a water and foam mixture. The MMA discharge valves are equipped with fusable links which will disconnect the air supply in the event of a fire allowing the valves to fail closed. \n\n\n\nAn alternative release scenario for methylamine (MMA) would be a leak during unloading operations from the railcar to the storage tanks. This could be a result improper draining during connection of transfer hoses from the railcar to the storage tank. It is assumed that 1,100 pounds would be released during a typical charging time of 150 minutes (7.33 pounds per minute).
