The facility stores the chemicals in pressurized tanks and transfers them to and from various transportation modes including tank truck, rail car, barges and ships.  The processes are storage and transfer only.  The storage and transfer consists of three processes:\r\n\r\n    *Toxic and other flammable Storage and Transfer\r\n    *Propylene Storage and Transfer\r\n   \r\nThe systems and procedures for storage and transfer of propylene are specific to propylene. The systems for storage and transfer of other flammables and all toxics are the same basic design and use the same procedures.\r\n\r\nWe have identified the following toxic chemicals that have the  potential to cause offsite consequences in the event of a sub"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including: Process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup review, compliance audits, incident investigation, employee participation, hot work permit procedure and contractor safety.\r\n\r\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\r\n\r\n1.  All tanks are pressurized with two levels of pressure relief with the first relieving to an abatement device at 80% of design pressure;\r\n2.  Temperature, pressure and level instrumentation including alarms. ;\r\n3.  All key parameters are monitored in a central control room;\r\n4.

A central control room was installed and made operational. All important parameters are monitored and alarmed on all tanks. Logging of the parameter trends is also included allowing the parameter trend to be analyzed over a 30 day period. \r\nIn addition the Propylene Storage and transfer system has:\r\n\r\n1.  Spheres designed and built to the ASME Code;\r\n2.  Automatic Shutdown;\r\n3.  Area leak detectors; and\r\n4.  All components are dedicated to propylene and acetaldehyde service.\r\n\r\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility. During the last five years there was one accident as a result of chemical releases. The accident in 2012 resulted in medical treatment for the injured employee.\r\n\r\nFor this incident, we conducted  a root cause analyze to identify and correct the root causes of the event.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nWe maintain an emergency response and contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and we are members of the local Mutual Aid Association.
