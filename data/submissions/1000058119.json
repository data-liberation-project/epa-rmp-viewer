The propane is transferred to the terminal storage tanks for loading into delivery trucks. The tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 80% of their capacity.  Sylva Terminal has four rail car spots for unloading propane into the terminal storage tanks.\r\n\r\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nPropane is the finished product which is received from rail tank cars into the eight storage tanks.  This material is routed from these tanks to the loading docks for wholesale distribution to propane retailers via tank trucks.\r\n\r\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe EPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case scenarios(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.

Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.   This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at the design flow rate following the hose rupture and the automatic high flow shutdown failed to activate . Activation of the Emergency Shutdown devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility after an estimated maximum release time of two minutes.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.  The quantity and endpoint of the simulation is contained in the data elements.\r\n\r\nWe are using this information to help us ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nEnterprise maintains an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning and reporting.
