      "SummaryText": "Advance Food Company utilizes anhydrous ammonia for its product refrigeration processes. The process technology of ammonia refrigeration systems has been in existence for many years and is therefore standardized and not subject to signficant change. Changes in design for the system involved only additions to or modifications of the existing system and its components. The technical design basis for ammonia refrigeration would only be modified by the IIAR, ANSI, ASHRAE, or similar organization. Therefore, Advance Food Company does not directly control management of process technology.\n\nAmmonia is self-alarming by its distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in any significant health risk). Most mechanical rooms with ammonia storage/process equipment, even well ventilated, may have concentrations oaround 5 PPM.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1992. The dominant characteristic of a Group 2 Refrigerant is its toxicity. Ammonia is self alarming by its distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, personnel exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations. Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, in heavy concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe department of Transportation classifies ammonia as non-flammable. However, ammonia is flammable within concentrations of 18-25% volume in air. Oil carried by the ammonia vapors in the process systems lowers this level considerably, and generally 4% by volume in air is considered the safe limit to prevent explosion.\n\nIn recognition of the potential adverse effects of ammonia release both from an employee and public safety perspective, Advance Food Company has instituted Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program, in addition to the existing safety programs.
