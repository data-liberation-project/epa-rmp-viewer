      "SummaryText": "\nAdvance Food Company utilizes anhydrous ammonia for its product refrigeration processes. The process technology of ammonia refrigeration systems has been in existence for many years and is therefore standardized and not subject to signficant change. Changes in design for the system involved only additions to or modifications of the existing system and its components. The technical design basis for ammonia refrigeration would only be modified by the IIAR, ANSI, ASHRAE, or similar organization. Therefore, Advance Food Company does not directly control management of process technology.\n\nAmmonia is self-alarming by its distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, persons exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations (these concentrations would not result in any significant health risk). Most mechanical rooms with ammonia storage/process equipment, even well ventilated, may have concentrations oaround 5 PPM.\n\nAmmonia is classified as a Group 2 Refrigerant per ASHRAE Standard 34-1992. The dominant characteristic of a Group 2 Refrigerant is its toxicity. Ammonia is self alarming by its distinctive pungent odor. Due to this odor, personnel exposed to ammonia vapor will not voluntarily stay in areas of even small concentrations. Ammonia is readily absorbed into the moisture of the skin and, in heavy concentrations, can cause severe burns.\n\nThe department of Transportation classifies ammonia as non-flammable. However, ammonia is flammable within concentrations of 18-25% volume in air. Oil carried by the ammonia vapors in the process systems lowers this level considerably, and generally 4% by volume in air is considered the safe limit to prevent explosion.\n\nIn recognition of the potential adverse effects of ammonia release both from an employee and public safety perspective, Advance Food Company has instituted Process Safety Management Program and Risk Management Program, in addition to the existing safety programs. The plans include "

Training under the HAZCOM Standard (1910-120) is used to familiarize affected employees with the chemicals and how to read MSDS's, however it is supplemented with training in such subjects as:\n                                                        HAZMAT Emergency Response\n                                                        Standard Operating Procedures\n                                                        Reading and using P&ID's in daily routine tasks and emergency conditions\n                                                        Safe Work Practices\n                                                        Emergency evacuation and response\n                                                        Safety Procedures\n                                                        Work authorization activities\n                                      "

Refresher training will be conducted at a minimum of three-year interval unless changes in operations or process methodology prompt more frequent training events.\n\nContractors performing work on the ammonia systems will be held to the same high standards as Advance Food Company employee's and in conformance with the PSM standard. Specifically, Advance Food Company will assure the following:\n\nThe contract employer's safety record is reviewed and evaluated. The contractor employer is aware of the known hazards related to the contractor's assigned work and the processes. The contractor employer is aware of all applicable provisions of the sites emergency action plan.

Each contractor employee is instructed in known hazards and applicable provisions of the emergency action plan. Appropriate employee training and documentation is maintained. Contractor employee's adhere to the safe work practices.

These programs incorprate requirements for other non-routine work practices by individuals, including contractors, to include line break, lock-out-tag-out and temporary operational permits.\n\nIn order to properly manage process system changes, written procedures have been developed and implemented to coordinate these changes. This effort identifies and evaluates all changes as \"change in kind\" or majors, and produce documentation of the evaluation. The results of these evaluations may include procedure changes and require additional training before start-up can be authorized.\n\nShould the preventative actions addressed above be insufficient in preventing a system/component failure, the resulting incidents are treated as serious, regardless of the actual outcome. Advance Food Company does not measure the level of sererity by the outcome, but instead on the recognized potential consequences. In order to effectively address this concern, a response program has been implemented to include the following:\n\nAll incidents and near misses are investigated within 48 hours by a designated team. The root cause(s) and factors contributing to the incident are defined. Written corrective recommendations are provided to site management along with a plan to implement the recommendations of the incident investigation team.
