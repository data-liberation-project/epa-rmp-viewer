      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Calpine Corporation\u00bfs Sutter Energy Center (SEC) uses chemicals as a necessary part of reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to the atmosphere. Storing a large quantity of ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly. As the company responsible for operating the SEC, Calpine Corporation takes its safety obligations in storing and using ammonia as seriously as we take controlling emissions from the power plant. The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps we take every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe SEC accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices. All applicable procedures of the State of California and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program under Section (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) Amendment of 1990, 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68, and the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program under California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 19, Division 2, chapter 4.5. This document summarizes our existing health and safety programs, our internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of ammonia to the environment. The SEC has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe SEC is located approximately 7.5 miles southwest of Yuba City, California in Sutter County. Electricity generated by this facility is trans"

The plant is a merchant facility marketing the electrical power on the open power exchange market and ancillary service support to the California Independent Systems Operator (CAL-ISO) grid. The plant is located on a 38-acre parcel. \n\nThe facility currently stores anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance under RMP and CalARP regulations, in one 26-ton steel bulk storage tank capable of holding 12000 gallons. The storage tank`s maximum fill is set at 85% capacity or 10200 gallons. Ammonia is used at the SEC to reduce NOx created during the combustion of natural gas and exhausted from the two combustion turbine generators (CTG) and heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) duct burners. Ammonia vapor is drawn from the top of the storage tank and diluted with air, and injected into the tow selective catalytic reduction (SCR) units to reduce the NOx emissions.\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored at the SEC exceeds the federal RMP and CalARP specified threshold quantities of 10,000 pounds and 500 pounds, respectively; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP and CalARP regulations.\n\nRelief valves: Pressure relief valves are located throughout the process system to protect against excess pressure. All process related factory-set pressure relief valves are set to protect the safety of workers and the integrity of the equipment. All liquid and vapor piping from the storage tank are equipped with excess-flow valves to stop the flow from the bulk tank in the event of an emergency. \n\nContainment Area: The ammonia storage tank is located inside a secondary containment area sufficient to contain the full contents of the vessel, 24 hours of rain fall as determined by the 25-year storm and deluge water for 20 minutes as determined by code.\n\nLeak detectors: Four ammonia leak detector transmitters are provided to detect major leakage and alarm locally and in the Con"

The detectors trigger an alarm when a concentration of 150 ppm of ammonia is detected in the air.\n\n\nAlarm Systems:  The ammonia process is checked at least twice during every 12-hour shift as part of the normal rounds at SEC. The storage tank is provided with a local pressure indicator (in psig) and level indicators (in percent volume). The tank also has pressure safety valves, temperature gauges, and ammonia leak detectors. Indication and alarms for tank level, temperature, and pressure are displayed on the local control panel and Control Room Distributed Control System (DCS). An ammonia vaporizer alarm is also provided in the Control Room DCS.\n\nEmergency Shower and Eyewash: An emergency eyewash and shower are provided at the truck unloading station near the ammonia storage tank.\n\nDeluge System: A deluge water system is provided around the storage tank to dissipate the ammonia vapor cloud in case of a leak. The system will be manually activated locally at the ammonia tank or from the Control Room in the event of an ammonia leak.\n\nFire Safe Stop Valve: An emergency fire safe stop valve is provided on the main vapor line from the storage tank. This stop valve is wired directly to the DCS. In the event of a fire or ammonia spill, the operator is to manually initiate a valve closure from the DCS. Limit switches on the valve will indicate the valve position in the Control Room DCS.\n\nAccess to the SEC from South Township Road is controlled by two gates on the east side of the plant, the northern most of which is the main entrance gate. The two gates remain closed at all times. The main gate is equipped with a security camera and call box and is controlled locally and remotely from the Control Room. Visitors and contractors must be approved by the SEC staff prior to entry into the facility.\n\nSummary of the Ac"

The team consisted of process operating and maintenance experts and process design engineers. The PHA technique used was What If Analysis/Checklist Methods, one of EPA\u00bfs recommended approaches. The PHA was led by a person knowledgeable on the type of process being reviewed. This review will be updated again within a 5-year period or whenever there is a major change in the process. A list of actions to resolve any significant findings from the August 2000 analysis was prepared, and staff resolved and documented this action item list. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nSEC maintains up-do-date, accurate, written operating procedures that give clear instructions for the ammonia process. SEC ensures effective operating practices by combining them with operating and maintenance training programs. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) provide system descriptions, specifications, equipment inspection requirements, and operating procedures for the ammonia system. Procedures include startup, shutdown, and normal, alternate, and emergency operation. Also included are maintenance and troubleshooting procedures, including consequences of deviation and steps to avoid or correct deviations.

Oral reviews and written self-evaluations are used to verify that an employee understands the training material before the process work can be resumed.\n\nTraining documentation includes: date of most recent review or revision to the training program, type of training required and the type of competency testing used to ensure staff understands the training. On-going employee training records are maintained.\n\nContractors\n\nThe SEC has procedures and policies in place that ensure that only contractors with good safety programs are selected to perform work on and around the ammonia process. Contractors are properly informed of the hazards, access limitations to these process areas, and emergency response procedures, and are prepared to safely complete the work. The SEC sets minimum contractor safety performance requirements for work in process areas, holds contractor safety briefings before allowing them near or in the process area, controls access to the process areas, and evaluates the contractor\u00bfs performance.\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review and Mechanical Integrity Program\n\nSEC ensures that a pre-startup safety review is completed for any new regulated process at the plant, or for significant modifications to an existing covered process that requires a change in the process safety information.
