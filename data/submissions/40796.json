      "SummaryText": "Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\nAt the Foamex Plant in Fort Wayne, IN, we handle toluene diisocyanate (TDI), which is considered hazardous and regulated by the EPA.  The same properties that make TDI valuable for use at our facility also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in the handling of the substance . Safety precautions have been implemented to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of our community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations.\n\nWe are committed to the safety of our employees and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.  Successful implementation of our accidental release prevention program will help ensure that emergencies are unlikely and reduce the likelihood that emergency response procedures will be needed.  Nevertheless, an emergency such as a release of TDI is possible.  We have emergency response procedures to help ensure that accidents will be mitigated properly without undue risk to the public, environment, employes, contractors, or other personnel within the plant.\n\nDescription of the facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce flexible polyurethane foam, which is sold to other facilities and used to produce foam for the automotive industry, specialty products and a number of other products.  TDI is one of the reactants required to produce polyurethane foam.  TDI is received by rail car and by tank truck, and is stored in indoor storage tanks.  The maximum quantity of TDI stored in rail cars and in storage tanks at our plant is about 960,000 pounds.  The TDI is piped to a mix head where it is mixed with other reactants to produce a slab of polyurethane foam.  The foam is conveyed to cutting stations where it is cut to the size"

TDI is covered because the maximum quantity stored onsite exceeds EPA's threshold quantity (TQ) of 10,000 pounds.\n\nOffsite consequence analysis of release scenarios:\n\nRemoved.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe plant has implemented programs and procedures that comply with EPA's Level 2 Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule.  Our facility qualifies for Level 2 coverage because (1) our worst case release scenarios for TDI can impact persons across the property boundary of the nearest public receptor, and (2) TDI is not a substance covered by OSHA's process safety management standard (PSM).  Our accidental release program is designed to systematically accomplish the following functions:\n\n-Control the creation and retention of safety information regarding the regulated substances, processes and equipment\n-Conduct hazard reviews to identify, evaluate, and control process hazards associated with the regulated substances, processes and procedures\n-Create, maintain, and evaluate operating procedures for activities within or near processes that use regulated substances\n-Provide training for personnel who operate covered processes so that they safely perform their jobs \n-Monitor and control maintenance activities that can affect the mechanical integrity of equipment used in covered processes\n-Confirm through compliance audits that RMP practices at the plant are consisten with our written programs and that the programs are adequate to address all of the requirements of the RMP rule\n-Ensure that process incidents, particularly those of catastrophic magnitude or potential, are thoroughly investigated using our incident investigation procedures and that relevant findings are communicated throughout the company to help prevent recurrence\n\nThe TDI process at our plant has haza"

Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental releases that could be caused by equipment failures, human errors, and by management system failures.\n\nIn addition to the accidental release prevention program, our plant has safety features on many units to help (1) contain or control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of or mitigate a release.  The following types of safety features are used in various units of the TDI process:\n\nRelease Detection\n-High level alarms\n\nRelease Containment/Control\n-TDI storage tanks are piped to overflow to other vessels\n-Curbing or dikes to contain TDI liquid releases\n-TDI storage tanks located inside an enclosed building\n-Pressure/vacuum relief devices on vessels to prevent rupture or collapse\n-Remote shutdown of unloading and transfer pumps\n-Magnetic drive TDI centrifugal pumps without seals\n-Valves to permit isolation of the process\n-TDI railcar inner tank is surrounded by an outer shell filled with insulation\n-TDI railcars are top unloaded through a nozzle in the top of the tank\n\nRelease Mitigation\n-Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\n-Trained emergency response personnel\n-Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus, breathing air stations)\n\nFive-year Accident History\n\nWe have had no releases of TDI in the last 5 years that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering-in-place, property damage, or environmental damage off site. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nOur emergency response program is based on the requirements in OSHA's emergency action and fire prevention plan regulation, OSHA's hazardous waste and emergency operations regulation, and EPA's emergency response program requirements in its R"

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary, based on modifications made to plant processes or other facilities.  Personnel affected by changes in the program are informed and or trained on those changes.\n\nThe overall emegency response program for the plant is coordinated with the LEPC.  This coordination includes participation in periodic meeting of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and other industry representatives.  The plant has around-the-clock communications capability with the appropriate LEPC officials and emgency response organizations such as the fire department.  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  The plant also conducts periodic tours that involve the LEPC nad emergency response organizations.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\n\nWe strive to continuously improve the safety of our plant TDI process through periodic safety reviews and a program of soliciting safety suggestions from employees.  Our hazard review and incident investigation programs are especially designed to identify needed process safety improvements, some of which result in changes to the processes.  The following changes are currently planned for implementation:\n\n-Installation of rupture disks in piping to prevent over pressuring of lines.\n-Revise maintenance and operating procedures as a"
