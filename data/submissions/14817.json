Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and emloyees of Tidewater's Umatilla Terminal at 671 Tank Farm Rd., Pasco, Washington are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of Anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.     Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity (for this Risk Management Plan) at the Tidewater Terminal is the storage of the non-hazardous fertilizer produced from a mobile reactor, and to provide a rail siding for Anhydrous Ammonia for this process.\n\nThe regulated substance(s) that are occasionally stored at this facility would be Anhydrous Ammonia at or above the threshold level for the RMP.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is recieved via rail car and reacted with Phosphoric Acid to produce ammonia polyphosphate fertilizer.  This end product is considered non-hazardous.  This fertilizer is utilized for land application in crop production.\n\nThe reactor utilized in this process is not the property of the J.R. Simplot COmpany, UAP Northwest, Cenex Land of Lakes Agronomy or Tidewater Terminal.  It is a private company that travels with this equipment to various states providing this service for retail fertilizer locations.  No employees of the above named companies are involved in any of this processing.  The sole reason the regulated substance is on Tidewater Terminals property is for the purpose of making this non-hazardous end product fertilizer.  There is no storage of a regulated substance under Clean Air Act 112(r). \n\n3.     The Worst-Case Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for Anhydrous Ammonia would be the release of the total contents of the rail car released as a ga"

      "SummaryText": "s over a 10 minute period.  The maximum release would be 145,000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest rail car at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident) is a release from a break in a transfer hose, which is estimated to release 11,908 pounds over a release duration of 2 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.41 miles based on modeling using CAMEO.\n\n4.     Emergency Response Program\n\nThis facility has developed a written Emergency Contigency Plan (C-Plan).  The plan addresses the regulations concerning emergency plans mandated under: OSHA 29 CFR-1910.38 and 1910.119, EPA 40 CFR - part 264, subpart D, and part 68 and 279.52, DOT/RSPA - 40 CFR part 194.  Elements within this part include employee training, SARA Title III reporting requirements and Community Right-to-Know. pre-emergency planning, and emergecny response information.\n\n5.     Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe users of Anhydrous Ammonia at this facility implemented the provisions of the \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI K61.1). and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.\"\n\n6.     Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidental releases or near misses of Anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\nhave caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\nhave resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n7.     Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility, and by the owner of the reactor.  "
