      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies at Watervliet Arsenal:\n\n\n\nThe US Army Watervliet Arsenal (WVA) maintains an accidental release prevention program covering design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, management of change, and employee training associated with the facility's processes. Policy is provided in US Army Regulation 200-1, Environmental Protection and Enhancement and WVA's Environmental Management System Policy established by the WVA Commander. WVA maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that applies to all types of emergencies, including emergencies related to the RMP Rule (40 CFR Part 68).\n\n\n\nWVA has 24/7 on-site security and fire services including its own spill hotline. WVA also coordinates emergency response planning with local Police and Fire Departments, including Emergency Medical Services.\n\n\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled at WVA:\n\n\n\nWVA is a government-owned, government-operated facility located in Watervliet, New York, adjacent to the Hudson River 3.5 miles northeast of the City of Albany. WVA is owned by the US Department of the Army, and has been in continuous operation since 1813. WVA manufactures field artillery components (e.g., cannons) using the latest metals machining and metals processing technologies. \n\n\n\nWastewater generated from the WVA manufacturing process is treated at WVA to reduce hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) to trivalent chromium (Cr3+) and the treatment process requires more than the threshold quantity of anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2),which is a RMP-regulated substance. Therefore, WVA is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G: Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nAs chromic acid wastewater is pumped through the industrial wastewater treatment process, SO2 gas is injected into the waste stream to reduce the Cr6+ to the less toxic Cr3+. In general, higher concentrations of Cr6+ require the addition of more SO2 to succes"

The WVA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program is process specific to address SO2 use at the IWTP, and is tailored to assure compliance under both the RMP and PSM regulations.  As part of the OSHA requirements, WVA maintains a PSM plan.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: \n\nWVA maintains records of safety information that describe the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all covered processes.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis: \n\nWVA's Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) details requirements for conducting both initial and updated PHAs in a manner compliant with 29 CFR Part 1910.119(e). All critical safety actions prompted by PHA recommendations are required to be completed prior to process startup, and non-critical items are required to be completed within the timeframe established by the PHA. The required PHA revalidation frequency is specified as at least every five years after completion of the initial PHA to ensure consistency with the as-built design.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: \n\nAll operating procedures are available to all employees through the central, electronic files in the WVA SharePoint, and the operators are routinely retrained on these procedures. Consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.69(a)(1), the process operating procedures contain steps for each operating phase, inclusive of initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and s"

WVA's operating procedures also include information on the operating limits of each process, inclusive of the consequences of deviation from these limits and the steps required to correct or avoid deviation. Procedures are subjected to a regular review and recertification to assure that the contained information is correct and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nTraining: \n\nThe WVA section of the Army's Total Employee Development (TED) system is where personnel training is managed and also serves as the central repository for the maintenance of training records for WVA personnel. Each employee involved in the operation of any process at WVA is trained on the applicable Operating Procedures. All training includes emphasis of the specific safety and health hazards associated with the equipment and chemicals involved, as well as emergency operation and safe work practices. Initial training for each operator consists of reading the procedure, and being instructed firsthand on process operations via a walkthrough with the procedure in-hand. Upon any procedure change, each operator is retrained using the same methods as for initial training. The Training Department maintains a database of each employee's required training, including the date of the initial training, the date of the most recent training, and the date that the next refresher training is required.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity: \n\nWVA has established written procedures to ensure the ongoing integrity of process equipment and employees are trained in conducing these maintenance activities. Additionally, the facility has an overarching Maintenance Plan which documents the Preventative Maintenance and Inspection System. The aspects of this plan satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68.73 for addressing the ongoing mechanical integrity of pressure vessels and storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems and devices, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.\n\n\n\nManageme"

The overall (MOC) framework at WVA ensures applicable requirements of the RMP regulations, a variety of occupational safety and health requirements, and international standards are met. The MOC Procedure begins with completion of the MOC Form, followed by a PHA. The next steps include subsequent reviews, documented and certified changes, and the process ends with updating system records and training, and the performance of a pre-startup process review.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Process Reviews: \n\nThe Safety Manager, WVA Fire Chief, Industrial Hygienist, Chief of Public Works, and the Plant Leader are responsible for conducting pre-startup process reviews of the IWTP chromium reduction process after a change has been made.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation: \n\nWVA's Safety Incident Reporting & Investigation Requirements describe the reporting and investigation requirements for events involving explosions, motor vehicle incidents, severe storm or weather damage and spills with occupational injuries. Per this written procedure, the \"investigation team must be formed and the investigation started as soon as possible based on the class of the incident and the conditions surrounding the incident and affected area.\" WVA's Incident Investigation Process complies with Army Regulation 385-40, which requires formal reporting to higher headquarters for serious incidents.\n\n\n\nSpill Reports: \n\nAll spills at WVA are required to be reported and investigated as environmental events, even if the event is a nominal release entirely contained within secondary containment and without resulting in any health or safety impacts.
