All critical safety actions prompted by PHA recommendations are required to be completed prior to process startup, and non-critical items are required to be completed within the timeframe established by the PHA.

WVA maintains an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that applies to all types of emergencies, including emergencies related to the RMP Rule (40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nWVA has 24/7 on-site security and fire services including its own spill hotline. WVA also coordinates emergency response planning with local Police and Fire Departments, including Emergency Medical Services.\r\n\r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled at WVA:\r\n\r\nWVA is a government-owned, government-operated facility located in Watervliet, New York, adjacent to the Hudson River 3.5 miles northeast of the City of Albany. WVA is owned by the US Department of the Army, and has been in continuous operation since 1813. WVA manufactures field artillery components (e.g., cannons) using the latest metals machining and metals processing technologies. \r\n\r\nWastewater generated from the WVA manufacturing process is treated at WVA to reduce hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) to trivalent chromium (Cr3+) and the treatment process requires more than the threshold quantity of anhydrous sulfur dioxide (SO2),which is a RMP-regulated substance. Therefore, WVA is subject to the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68, Subpart G: Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nAs chromic acid wastewater is pumped through the industrial wastewater treatment process, SO2 gas is injected into the waste stream to reduce the Cr6+ to the less toxic Cr3+.

Each employee involved in the operation of any process at WVA is trained on the applicable Operating Procedures. All training includes emphasis of the specific safety and health hazards associated with the equipment and chemicals involved, as well as emergency operation and safe work practices. Initial training for each operator consists of reading the procedure, and being instructed firsthand on process operations via a walkthrough with the procedure in-hand. Upon any procedure change, each operator is retrained using the same methods as for initial training.
