The facility is designed to transfer butane from railcars to trucks for delivery to end markets.\nTETL has a long-standing commitment to workers and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of TETL facilities. TETL policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, trained TETL personnel plan to evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies.\n1.1\tDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\nButanes are unloaded from railcars into trucks with an operating capacity of approximately 2,291,600 gallons of butane. The railcars and connected pipelines are considered a single process that has two or more connected vessels of the same regulated substance that could be involved in a potential release at the facility. Regulated flammable substances (listed in the 40 CFR \u00a768.130) used at the facility are i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, and n-Pentane. Since there are different flammable substances in a single process, this is defined as a flammable mixture. The RMP rule only applies to flammable mixtures if the amount of a regulated substance in the mixture is greater than one percent (1%) and the mixture as a whole meets the National Fire Protection Association\u0092 s 4 rating (NFPA-4) requirements of \u0093materials that vaporize quickly or completely when subjected to normal atmospheric pressure and temperature, are easily dispersed in the air, and burn easily\u0094. Typically, this degree includes materials that will spontaneously ignite when exposed to air, flammable gases, flamma"

The covered process for the mixture of flammable substances is calculated for a worst-case scenario that involves the flammable mixture substances above the threshold quantities, greater than 10,000 pounds.\nToxics were not modeled as part of this analysis because the only regulated substances present are i-Butane, n-Butane, i-Pentane, and n-Pentane, which are not classified as toxic substances.\n1.2\tGeneral Accident Release Program 3 Prevention Program \n1.2.1\tEmployee Participation\nTETL encourages employees to participate in areas of process safety management and accident prevention as follows:\n\u0095\tUpdating and compiling technical documents and chemical information\n\u0095\tPerforming necessary calculations for Process Safety Management (PSM) and Risk Management Plan (RMP)\n\u0095\tMaintaining good engineering practices\n\u0095\tParticipating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team\nEmployees have access to information about the accident prevention program.\n1.2.2\tProcess Safety Information\nTETL has developed and implemented numerous technical documents to support the safe operation of the facility processes. These technical documents address:\n\u0095\tChemical properties and associated hazards\n\u0095\tNecessary block flow diagrams of the process\n\u0095\tMaximum chemical substance inventories\n\u0095\tUpper and lower limits of fixed and rotating process equipment\n\u0095\tEquipment design basis and configuration information\n\u0095\tAdequate information to support good engineering practices\nThe information referenced above is included in the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and 1910.38 Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provided by TETL.\nChemical-specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in the chemical safety data s"

For regulated process areas, TETL has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, levels, and composition in the operators' procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process equipment and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents with information about the design and construction of the process equipment including materials of construction, design pressures, temperature, and electrical ratings. The design and construction information of the process equipment, in combination with procedures and equipment operating history, provide a basis for inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes. Process safety information must be readily accessible to workers and contractors.\n1.2.3\tProcess Hazard Analysis \nTETL has a comprehensive program, including a team of personnel, to identify and manage hazards associated with the RMP-covered process. This program systematically examines potential hazards and puts equipment in place to manage hazards. The team identifies, evaluates, and makes recommendations for the management of identified potential hazards. The team's findings are forwarded to TETL management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until completion. The ultimate resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nThe facility continuously updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These continuous reviews are conducted regularly for at least five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n1.2.4\tOperating Procedures\nTETL maintains written Operating Procedures for the covered process that address primary"

These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are continuously reviewed and annually certified by management for completeness and accuracy. Operating procedures are revised, as necessary, by employee suggestions, compliance audits, PHAs, good engineering practice, and pre-startup safety reviews (PSSR), to maintain completeness and accuracy. Revisions are implemented through TETL management.\nProcess operating procedures are readily available for personnel to use, as necessary, to safely perform their job tasks and maintain the process unit operations within the defined limits.\n1.2.5\tTraining\nTETL has implemented a comprehensive training program for employees involved in operating covered processes at the facility. New employees receive basic training in process operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review must be concluded during this training interval. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks safely on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, operators continuously receive subsequent training on the operating procedures to refresh their skills and knowledge to an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted regularly for at least three years, or more frequently, if deemed necessary. Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n1.2.6\tContractors\nTETL may use contractors to supplement its workforce during intervals of increased maintenance or construction activities.

Facility personnel also monitor contractor performance concerning their safety obligations.\n1.2.7\tPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\nTETL conducts a PSSR for new facility modifications that require a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to see that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for a startup before placing the equipment into service. This review provides an additional check that construction is in compliance with the design specifications and that supporting systems are ready. A PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves as quality assurance verification that the prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n1.2.8\tMechanical Integrity\nTETL has established practices and procedures for the secure operation of fixed, rotating, and emergency shutdown equipment.

Examinations and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended, and that equipment is operating within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate welfare concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. The management team reviews the status of the equipment and determines what further action is necessary.\nAn integral part of the integrity program is quality assurance. TETL incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to determine that new equipment is applicable for its intended use and that the proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n1.2.9\tSafe Work Practices\nTETL has standing safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, industrial standards, and good engineering practices in place to help provide employee, public, and process safety.\n1.2.10\tManagement of Change\nTETL has a comprehensive system to manage changes to facility processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. Each proposed change must be reviewed to:\n\u0095\tDetermine that adequate equipment is in place to manage new hazards \n\u0095\tVerify that existing equipment has not been compromised by the proposed change\nAffected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information and procedures are updated to incorporate these changes. In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are trained on the changes.\n1.2.11\tIncident Investigation\nTETL promptly investigates each incident related t"

The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop recommendations to prevent future occurrences and forward these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team\u0092s findings and recommendations are tracked until they are concluded. The ultimate resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least five years.\n1.2.12\tCompliance Audits\nAccording to 40 CFR \u00a768.79(a), TETL is required to conduct an audit every 3 years of the covered procedure to assess compliance with the requirements of the prevention program. The audit must involve at least one individual who is knowledgeable about the process. Good engineering practices are conducted by TETL employees and management, or a qualified third-party, if appropriate. This audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are concluded. The ultimate resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n1.2.13\tChemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nTETL's accidental release prevention and response policies are applied to the entire RMP-covered process through universal prevention activities, including but not limited to: elimination of sources of ignition, drains for liquid releases, and avoidance of congested areas. Collectively, these prevention program activities help avoid potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n1.2.14\tSpecialized Safety Features\nFacility-specific detection and equipment (safety features) are deployed throughout the facility to:\n\u0095\tContain/monitor a release\n\u0095\tQuickly detect a release\n\u0095\tReduce the consequences of an R"
