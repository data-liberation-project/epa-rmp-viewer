In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\nEach of the facility\u2019s three processes exceeds the 10,000 lb regulatory threshold quantity of isopentane.  As a result, all three processes are subject to CalARP Program Level 3, EPA RMP Program Level 3, and Cal/OSHA PSM.\nThe Prevention Program 3 elements include: \n\u2022\tProcess Safety Information\n\u2022\tProcess Hazard Analysis\n\u2022\tOperating Procedures\n\u2022\tTraining\n\u2022\tMechanical Integrity\n\u2022\tManagement of Change\n\u2022\tPre-Startup Safety Review\n\u2022\tCompliance Audits \n\u2022\tIncident Investigation \n\u2022\tEmployee Participation \n\u2022\tHot Work Permit\n\u2022\tContractors\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents meeting the Five-year Accident History criteria (per 40CFR68.42) at Heber 2. \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nHeber staff are not First Responders.

The electric power generated by this process is then sold to contracted off-takers. \nThere are a total of three processes in the facility; Gould 2 \u2013 commissioned in 2005, Heber South \u2013 commissioned in 2008, and a new OEC 1&2 I3LU \u2013 to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2022.  Six older, smaller process units known as Heber 2 are being decommissioned upon the startup of OEC 1&2 I3LU.  The maximum intended inventory of isopentane in all three processes is 826,992 lbs.  This includes the quantity charged to all three processes plus some residual quantity kept in storage.  The intent is to minimize the amount kept in storage to ensure adequate capacity for process evacuation during maintenance activity.\nThe site is currently operated by Heber staff and is staffed 24 hrs a day. The facility employs approximately 30 personnel.\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\nScenario Description: The worst-case release scenario is defined by the release of the contents of the OEC 2 vaporizer.  A similar release from the OEC 1 vaporizer or any one of the five storage tanks (in full condition) would result in the same impact zone.  The potentially impacted public receptors are the adjacent agricultural land, the solar power facility, and an industrial concrete plant. The results can be found in the CalARP Submittal Binder.  \nAlternate Release Scenarios Results Summary\nScenario Description: An alternate release scenario was modeled as well.  Public receptors can also potentially be impacted by this release. The results can be found in the CalARP Submittal Binder.\nThe scenarios are also displayed in the graphic file attached to the RMP eSubmit document.\nRISK CONSIDERATIONS\nAlthough the use of isopentane has inherent potential risks, and worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios can potentially reach public receptors; Heber has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the"

Heber is extremely diligent in the handling of the regulated substance isopentane and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Heber staff are highly trained and utilizes modern equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely using isopentane for geothermal power production.\nHeber has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the isopentane systems. Heber\u2019s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of isopentane.\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nHeber\u2019s geothermal power production facility is fueled by hot geothermal brine from the Heber Geothermal Reservoir located in Heber, California, approximately 1.5 miles south of the town of Heber. The area around the facility consists of agricultural land, a solar power installation and an industrial concrete plant.\nThe process is a binary Rankine cycle. In that process, energy is transferred from the hot geothermal brine to an isopentane working fluid, referred to as motive fluid, in shell and tube heat exchangers.  The motive fluid is vaporized in the heat exchangers which drives turbines that are coupled to generators to produce electric power.  The motive fluid exiting the turbines is condensed in water-cooled shell and tube heat exchangers and returned to the process in a closed loop"
