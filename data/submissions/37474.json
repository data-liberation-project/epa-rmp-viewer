As part of this commitment, the Company has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the hazardous chemical processes at this facility. One component of this system is a Risk Management Program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at the facility and addresses compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Regulation 40 CFR 68, Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs (the RMP Rule). One of the requirements of the RMP Rule is to submit a Risk Management Plan (RMPlan) describing the Risk Management Program at Georgia-Pacific in Port Hudson. This document is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirements of the RMP Rule and to provide the public with a description of the Risk Management Program at the facility.\n\nThe Risk Management Program at the facility consists of three elements:\n\n1. a hazard assessment to help understand (a) the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical accidental releases and (b) accidents that may have occurred during the last five years associated with the use of the substances regulated by the RMP Rule (chlorine dioxide) - see topic 1.3\n \n2. a prevention program to help maintain and safely operate the processes containing more than the threshold quantity of the regulated substances (covered processes) - see topic 1.4\n \n3. an emergency response program to help respond to accidental releases of the regulated substances from the covered processes - see topic 1.6\n\nInformation further describing these elements is provided in this RMPlan.\n\nAlthough the Risk Management Program at the facility helps provide assurance that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe manner, it is only one component of the safety program at GP/Port Hudson.

When hazardous substances are used at the facility, the equipment is carefully designed, built, and operated to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release. Industry and government standards are closely adhered to in design, construction, and operation of the equipment.\n\nGP/Port Hudson limits damage from a release, if such a release occurs. The facility trains workers to respond to upset conditions, reducing the consequences of a release if it occurs. In addition, the facility will be working with the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) to help ensure that injuries and/or environmental damage will not occur in the event that a release does occur.\n\nThe safety program at GP/Port Hudson consists of a number of elements, only some of which are required by the RMP Rule. This RMPlan is primarily intended to describe those parts of the safety program at the facility that are required by the RMP Rule.\n\n\n1.1 Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nGP/Port Hudson is committed to the safety of workers and the public, as well as the preservation of the environment through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances. The facility implements reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of the hazardous substances. These controls include training programs for personnel; programs to help ensure safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the processes; and programs to evaluate the hazards at the facility.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, the facility will control and contain the release in a manner that will be safe for workers and will help prevent injury to the public and/"

As part of this manufacturing process, the facility produces and stores chlorine dioxide (C102) for use in the bleaching process. The Chlorine Dioxide Solution System, which includes the generation, storage and distribution of chlorine dioxide, is considered an RMP covered process in Program Level 3. \n\n\n1.3 Off-Site Consequence Analysis\n\nGP/Port Hudson performed an off-site consequence analysis to estimate the potential for an accidental release of the regulated substance to affect the public or the environment. The off-site consequence analysis consists of evaluating both the worst-case release scenario and an alternative release case scenario. The facility does not expect a worst-case release scenario to ever occur. An alternative release scenario represents a release that (1) might occur at a facility like GP/Port Hudson and (2) would result in an off-site consequence if the release occurred. The alternative release scenario will help the Local Emergency Planning Committee improve the community emergency response plan.\n\nThe main objective of performing the off-site consequence analysis is to determine the distance at which certain effects might occur to the public because of an accidental release (called the end-point distance). The following effects could occur at the endpoint distance. At distances less than the endpoint distance, the effects co"

These requirements include: \n\n>  one worst-case release scenario for a toxic substance in Program Level 3 (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n\n>  one alternative release scenario for each toxic substance in Program Level 3 processes (one scenario representing chlorine dioxide)\n \n The following information summarizes the off-site consequence analysis performed by Georgia-Pacific Port Hudson Operations.\n \n \n 1.3.1 Program Level 3 Process- Chlorine Dioxide (C102) Solution System\n \n In accordance with recent EPA changes to the RMP rule, Georgia-Pacific will not present worst case release simulation information in this summary.  \n \n The alternative release scenario for chlorine dioxide is the rupture of a chlorine dioxide solution line located at the discharge side of the C1O2 transfer pumps' header. During normal operations, two pumps are in operation. The pumps could pump approximately 1,700 gallons per minute for five minutes before the release might be recognized and isolated. The released chlorine dioxide solution will form a pool of minimum depth (1 centimeter) and evaporate to form a vapor cloud. The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration, based on the EPA RMP*Comp software, is 2.3 miles.

There are also several environmental receptors located within this distance.\n \n \n 1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program\n \n Georgia-Pacific Port Hudson Operations has always used a prevention program to help prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances. Beginning in 1992, the facility formalized this prevention program for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System to comply with the 14 elements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Process Safety Management (PSM) prevention program. In 1996, the EPA RMP Rule established that a Program Level 3 Prevention Program would become a requirement for these processes as well. The facility's Program Level 3 Prevention Program under the RMP Rule is essentially the same as the OSHA PSM Program, except that the program also focuses on protecting the public and the environment.\n \n \n 1.4.1 The following sections briefly describe the elements of the Georgia-Pacific Port Hudson Operations Program Level 3 Prevention Program that address the EPA RMP Rule prevention program requirements for the Chlorine Dioxide Solution System.\n \n 1. Employee Participation:  The facility has developed a written employee participation program for the covered processes to help ensure that the safety concerns of GP/Port Hudson employees are addressed. The facility encourages active participation from personnel in the development and maintenance of the prevention program activities for all processes at the facility. Employees are consulted on, and informed about, all aspects of the RMP Rule prevention program, including the development of Process Hazard Analysis and Operating Procedures.\n \n 2.

MSDS's for hazardous substances handled in each process are available in the control rooms so the operators have ready reference to this information. In addition, MSDS's are provided to the LEPC and/or Plant Emergency Response Teams for use in helping formulate emergency response plans\n \n Many of the operating parameters are included in the process technology information to help with the safe operation of the process. These documents are also used, (1) to train employees, (2) to perform process hazard analysis, and (3) to help maintain the equipment to the design specification.\n \n 3. Process Hazard Analysis:  GP/Port Hudson performs and periodically updates process hazard analyses (PHAs) of the covered processes to help identify process hazards and generate recommendations that might improve the safe operation of the process. A team composed of personnel with engineering and process operating experience and a team leader with experience in performing process hazard analyses is assembled to analyze the process. The facility primarily uses the \"Hazard and Operability\" (HAZOP) and/or \"What If'\" technique, supplemented with a checklist, to perform this analysis.
