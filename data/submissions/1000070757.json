The Authority's service area encompasses all three districts but focuses on those areas delivering flows to the Santa Rosa Wastewater Reclamation Facility (SRWRF) in Murrieta. The SRWRF is the only treatment plant governed by SRRRA and is the current and expected focus of its efforts. The SRWRF is currently operated by RCWD, and was purchased by SRRRA upon successful completion of acquiring the necessary financing. \r\n\r\nThe SRRRA service area is located in the southwestern part of Riverside County, including portions of the City of Temecula and City of Murrieta, and other contiguous land in the unincorporated territory of the County of Riverside. The SRWRF is operated by RCWD. The facility uses and handles chlorine use for disinfection.\r\n \r\nThe chlorine system consists of the chlorine bulk storage system, chlorinators, chlorine rapid mix basins, and chlorine contact basins. Chlorine is stored onsite in sixteen, one-ton cylinders (8 duty, 8 standby).  During normal operations, chlorine is withdrawn from the cylinders and the gaseous chlorine is fed by chlorinators to injectors which mix chlorine with water, forming a solution.  \r\n\r\nA scrubber system is available to treat and prevent releases of chlorine to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nChemicals Subject to USEPA Risk Management Plan (RMP), California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP) and OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM)\r\nRCWD uses chlorine at the SRWRF in quantities large enough to trigger the USEPA Risk Management Plan ("

The CalARP threshold quantity for chlorine is 100 pounds.  The maximum quantity present is 32,000 pounds of chlorine.  Chlorine is transported to the facility by truck.  SRWRF stores and uses one-ton cylinders.  \r\n\r\nThe SRWRF is also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with the chlorine storage and disinfection systems.  The threshold quantity under PSM for chlorine is 1,500 pounds.\r\n\r\nAccidental Releases During Past Five Years\r\n\r\nThe SRWRF has not had any releases of chlorine during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.  \r\nRCWD's RMP programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\r\n      \u00bf\tReview of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine storage and disinfection systems to verify that they are properly designed and installed.\r\n      \u00bf\tUpdating of standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures.
