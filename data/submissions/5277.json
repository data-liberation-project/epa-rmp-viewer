PAUL FACILITY RMP PLAN\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a wholesale chemical distributor serving a number of U.S. industries.  Founded in 1924, VW&R supplies the food industry, chemical compounders, pharmaceuticals, mining, forest products, oil and gas producers, electronics, coatings and many other key industries with the chemical raw materials required to produce or refine products used in numerous end-use markets.\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. is a member of the National Association of Chemical distributors (NACD) and complies with the Responsible Distribution Process (RDP), an environmental, health and safety improvement initiative.\n\nSome of the products stored and handled by VW&R are subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  A key requirement of this rule is the preparation and submission of an RMP Plan, contained herein.  The contents of the RMP Plan are prescribed by EPA, including this Executive Summary.\n\nCORPORATE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE APPROACH\n\n1. Prevention Program\n\nProcesses that are subject to OSHA's Process Safety management (PSM ) standard AND are regulated under EPA's RMP rule are subject to the Program 3 Prevention program.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc. has documented the Prevention Program in its Process Safety Management Manual.  Briefly, this program includes provisions and requirements for:\n\n* Process Safety Information\n* Process Hazard Analysis\n* Operating Procedures\n* Training\n* Mechanical Integrity\n* Management of Change\n* Pre-Startup Review\n* Compliance Audits\n* Incident Investigation\n* Employee Participation\n* Hot Work permits\n* Contractors\n\n\n\n2. Emergency Response Approach\n\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc. has an Emergency Contingency Plan in place.  This Plan is shared with local emergency responders who have access to VW&R facility personnel (and up-to-date phone numbers).  VW&R responds to minor incidents but will call in professional emergency responders"

Joint emergency exercises are conducted when possible.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND  REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Chemical Storage & Distribution.  We have one regulated substance present at our facility.  The substance is Formaldehyde present as a 37% aqueous solution.  Formaldehyde is warehoused at the facility for distribution to industrial users.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Formaldehyde solution at our facility at any one tine is 22,000 pounds.\n\n\nWORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO & ALTERNATE RELEASE SCENARIO\n(including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.)\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Formaldehyde.  The scenario involves the release of 55 gallons of Formaldehyde solution.  The toxic liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of  1 cm height, from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated over 10 minutes.  Passive mitigation controls such as enclosures are also taken into account to calculate the scenario.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 0.06 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L.\n\n\nGENERAL  ACCIDENT  RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM \nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements  set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is       the \"What-If\" technique. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of five years.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Van Waters & Rogers Inc maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every  year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure"

Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Van Waters & Rogers Inc to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Van Waters & Rogers Inc.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort."

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Van Waters & Rogers Inc has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, no accidental release of formaldehyde has occurred during this period.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nVan Waters & Rogers Inc is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.
