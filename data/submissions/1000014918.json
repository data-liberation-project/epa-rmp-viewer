      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nABOUT BRUSH WELLMAN INC.\n\nBrush Wellman Inc. is a subsidiary of Brush Engineered Materials, and is a producer of beryllium for beryllium-based metals and metal matrix composites.  Beryllium is a lightweight metal possessing unique mechanical and thermal properties.  Its specific stiffness is much greater than other engineered structural materials such as aluminum, titanium and steel.  BerylliumA?s unique properties make it the material of choice for many important uses.\n \nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nAt Brush Wellman Inc. we are committed to designing, operating and maintaining our process and facilities in a safe, environmentally sound and responsible manner.  We believe that incidents, injuries and illnesses are preventable and proactively work to maximize protection of workers, the public, and the environment. We strive to identify, evaluate, control and manage risks through a systematic, management systems-based approach.  Our comprehensive program focuses first on the prevention of accidental releases, while maintaining a strong commitment to effectively respond to emergencies to minimize harm to people and the environment.  Our management and employees work to continually improve our performance and meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.  \n\nThis document provides a concise overview of the comprehensive risk management activities at Brush Wellman Inc.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\n\nThe Elmore Plant is Brush WellmanA?s flagship facility.  The Elmore, Ohio manufacturing plant is about 4 miles from Elmore and is located on a 461-acre site in a rural area in Harris Township, Ottawa County.  The plant is at the intersection of State Route 590 and West Portage River South Road.  The plant employs about 600 employees.  Metals produced at the Elmore Plant can be found in end-use products in industries such as computer and telecommunications, automotive electronics, industrial compo"

This is the only covered process and chemical at the site.  The 70% hydrofluoric acid (HF) is received via tank truck and is offloaded to a specially designed storage tank where it is stored as a liquid at atmospheric temperature (and low corresponding pressure).  The hydrofluoric acid is transferred batch-wise as needed via a pump and transfer piping to one of two small vessels in an enclosed building where it is diluted below the specified EPA RMP concentration (for hydrofluoric acid, to less than 50%) and is used in the production of beryllium. \n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nA comprehensive accidental release prevention program has been developed and implemented to ensure the safe design, operation and maintenance of the 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid covered process.  An overall management system for the Risk Management Program specifically includes all aspects of the prevention program and addresses HF specific issues and steps taken to prevent an accidental release.  Brush WellmanA?s compliance requirements are for a Program 2 Prevention Program.  However, Brush Wellman has additional site programs that go above and beyond its compliance requirements and provide an enhanced level of prevention and safety.\n\nFollowing is a summary of Brush WellmanA?s program to address the required Program 2 Prevention Program elements and compliance for the 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid storage and transfer process.\n\nSafety Information\nIn the design of this new process a significant amount of safety information has been developed and is used in operation and maintenance of the process.  The safety information covers the process chemicals"

The safety information is maintained and updated to incorporate changes in the process. \n\nHazard Review\nThe initial hazard review exceeded the compliance requirements, as a full Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was conducted with a qualified leader and Brush Wellman team members using the safety information.  The process Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) for the HF process were reviewed using the highly thorough and systematic Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) method.  The review identified the causes and consequences of potential failures as well as the safeguards in place, and the HAZOP team made recommendations for improvements to the process.  Future hazard reviews and revalidations may be conducted with other hazard review techniques.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten operating procedures for all phases of operation are developed by the operations personnel, including technicians and supervisors - for all phases of operation.  Also included are procedures for routine inspections by operations personnel.  These procedures are updated as needed when major process changes occur.\n\nTraining\nThe site training program is formally managed and tracked, to ensure needed training is given and is at appropriate intervals for required refresher training.  Personnel are trained (initial and refresher) in the operating procedures and hazards of the process.\n\nMaintenance\nMaintenance is a key element of the site prevention program, and includes inspection, testing and preventative maintenance.  Procedures are prepared for maintaining the integrity of the process.  Maintenance personnel are trained in the process hazards, maintenance procedures and other safe work practices.  A maintenance scheduling program is used to enter and track work orders through to completion.\n\nCompliance Audits\nCompliance audits are conducted a minimum of every three years to assist in improving the site prevention program.  The audits are formally document"

Minor incidents and/or near misses may also be investigated at Brush WellmanA?s discretion.  Incident investigations are formally documented and recommended actions may be developed, resolved, tracked, and implemented.\n\nAdditional Site Programs\nBrush Wellman uses a number of additional site programs - that are not required for its Program 2 Prevention Program - but that aid in maximizing the level of safety in the covered process.  Brush Wellman again goes above and beyond its compliance requirements for the covered process through implementation of these additional programs. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAs a newly constructed process (complete in 2010) there are no reportable accidents.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Elmore site has a trained Emergency Response Team and equipment for internal company response to many potential incidents.  Emergency activation levels range from 0 (potential emergency condition controlled at the incident site) to 3 (full emergency condition A? for a severe hazard).  Additional emergency spill training is provided to Brush Wellman by its hydrofluoric acid supplier.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with Ottawa County Emergency Management [and the associated Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC)].  The Brush Wellman emergency response plan is also specifically coordinated with and built into the Ottawa County Emergency Management community plan.\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nBrush Wellman Inc. employs a continuous improvement philosophy at the Elmore Plant.  Systematic reviews conducted for the prevention program also specifically identify potential changes that are evaluated and may be implemented in the covered process.  Changes that improve safety m"
