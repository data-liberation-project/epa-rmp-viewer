This is demonstrated through a comprehensive system we?ve undertaken to prevent accidental releases at our facilities.  This system is all-encompassing, and includes (but is not necessarily limited to): System design and maintenance, Accurate Operating Procedures, and making sure each employee operating a covered process has been trained on our specific system through the use of our ammonia refrigeration contractors.\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass potato cold storage.  We have two regulated substances present at our facility, anhydrous ammonia used for cold storage refrigeration, and chlorine used to sanitize our rinse water.  \n\nWe have undertaken studies to determine our Worst Case and Alternative Release Scenarios using RMP Comp?, Land View ?, and RMP Submit ?.  The results of these scenario studies are available at the main office of the 12901 Packinghouse Road, Edison CA 93307.  \n\nWe?ve compiled safety information for this facility that includes: Original Blueprints, Piping & Instrumentation Diagrams, Original Equipment Manufacturer?s literature, Material Safety Data Sheets, Inspection Forms, and a detailed Mechanical Integrity Inspection Schedule.  This facility was originally constructed in accordance with ASTM standards, and has not undergone any changes that would result in modification of this data.\n\nIn order to ensure the safe operation of our system, we review our Standard Operating Procedures on an annual basis.  The most recent of these reviews was conducted in June of 2009.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nWe?ve instituted a detailed Mechanical Inspection program that is "

There has never been a release from this facility.  In case of accidental release or other emergency, Lehr Brothers/Big ?L? Packers maintains an effective Emergency Action Plan which details which steps to be taken in case of release or other disaster."
