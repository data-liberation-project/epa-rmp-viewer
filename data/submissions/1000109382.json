This is done through training of onsite personnel and contractors working on the site, the use of various safeguards to control hazards associated with potentially hazardous work, and the use of alarms during operations to detect anomalies in process operations.\n2.\tFacility and Regulated Substances\nMGC has one regulated substance Anhydrous Ammonia at the Mesa facility. The facility uses anhydrous ammonia and ammonium hydroxide to create ultra-pure ammonium hydroxide. The facility is subject to the Program Level 3 RMP requirements. [The OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation also applies to the facility because the anhydrous ammonia onsite exceeds the PSM limit of 10,000 pounds.]\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the MGC release prevention program that are in place at its stationary source. \n\n3.\tRelease Prevention Program at Mesa Plant \na.\tProcess Safety Information (PSI)\nMGC maintains a PSI record that describes chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the regulated substance and Covered Process.\nb.\tWorst-Case and Alternate-Case Release Scenarios\nInformation on the worst-case and alternative-case release scenarios is maintained in Section 5 of the facility RMP manual \u0096 Off-Site Consequence Analysis.\n\nc.\tProcess Hazardous Analysis (PHA)\nMGC conducted PHA studies to identify hazards associated with its Covered Process and review if appropriate controls were in place.

The PHAs were revalidated at least every five years. Findings and recommendations related to the PHAs were addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA for the Covered Process was completed in April 2023. \nd. Operating Procedures\nMGC maintains written operating procedures to safely conduct activities in the Covered Process. These procedures address various modes of operation, such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in these processes.\ne.\tTraining \nMPCA has a training program for employees tasked with operational processes and procedures. Refresher training is provided at least once every three years. MGC maintains records of the training that has been provided to employees.\nf.\tMechanical Integrity\nMGC has a preventive maintenance program for the equipment in the Covered Process. MGC carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operation. Covered Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  \nMaintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. MGC has established and implemented written procedures to maintain the ongoing integrity of process equipment. Equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \ng.\tManagement Of Change (MOC)\nMGC has a written MOC process for the Covered Process to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

The facility performs Pre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications of the Covered Process. The reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe start-up prior to placing equipment into operation. A completed PSSR is required prior to introducing hazardous materials to the process.\ni.\tCompliance Audits\nMGC conducts RMP compliance audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP regulation are being implemented. The last compliance audit for the facility was completed in April 2021.\nj.\tIncident Investigation\nMGC investigates incidents that have resulted in, or could reasonably result, in a catastrophic release of ammonia. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situations leading to each incident, as well as corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. Incident Investigation reports related to the Covered Process are retained for a minimum of five years. \nk.\tEmployee Participation \nMGC has developed a written employee participation plan. MGC employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend measures for improvement.  \nl.\tContractors \nPrior to selecting a contractor, MPCA completes an evaluation of the safety performance of the contractor. MGC trains contract employees on potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the Covered Process.

Employees and contractors are also informed of hazards in the workplace. Employees who work with potentially hazardous substances receive training that includes emergency procedures.\nMGC coordinates with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) so that the LEPC is aware of the Ammonia process and regulated substance and the emergency procedures proposed in the MGC Emergency Action Plan.
