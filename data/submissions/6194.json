Its two water filtration plants, drawing from the Potomac and Patuxent rivers, produce an average of 166 million gallons of potable water per day, and over 5,000 miles of water mains deliver that product to homes and businesses in Prince George\u0012s and Montgomery Counties.  The Commission operates three reservoirs, with a total capacity of 14 billion gallons, to ensure a reliable water supply for all seasons and conditions.\n\n\tSix wastewater treatment plants operated by WSSC provide sewage treatment. Every day an average of 181 million gallons of wastewater from Prince George\u0012s and Montgomery Counties move to facilities through 4,900 miles of sewers maintained by WSSC.  The six WSSC wastewater treatment plants have a combined capacity of over 73 million gallons per day (mgd). Under the Inter-municipal Agreement, WSSC is allocated 169 mgd of Blue Plains\u0012 370 mgd capacity.  WSSC, in turn, pays a share of the Blue Plains\u0012 operating and capital expenses. \n\n\nIV.\tPOWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES \n\n\tA six-member commission governs WSSC--three members from each county.  The Commissioners are appointed to four-year terms by their respective county executives, and confirmed by their county councils.\n\n\tThe Commission\u0012s powers and responsibilities are set forth in State law and in subsequent legislative amendments.  The Maryland General Assembly conferred these powers upon the WSSC to enable it to fulfill its principal functions.\n\n\tThe Commission\u0012s major functions are to:\n\n-\tprovide for the construction, operation, and maintenance of water supply and sanitary sewerage systems in Montgomery and Prince George\u0012s Counties,\n\n-\tapprove the locations of, and issue permits for, utilities installed in public ways, and \n\n-\testablish water consumption rates, sewer usage rates, connection charges, front foot benefit charges, and permit fees, and if required, cause ad valorem taxes to be  levied.\n\n\tThe Commission also:\n\n-\treviews preliminary subdiv"

The Bureau Office formulates operating policy and procedures, provides technical advice to the Commission and staff, and participates in inter and intra-agency meetings.    The Bureau Director serves as Chairman  of the Blue Plains Regional Committee, and the Principal Civil Engineer serves as  Chairman of the Blue Plains Technical Committee.  These Committees are charged with administration of the Inter-municipal Agreement, or IMA, which governs regional coordination on Blue Plains issues.  The Bureau Director also serves as WSSC\u0012s representative to the Council of Government\u0012s Environmental and Public Works Directors Committee (a committee which develops environmental policy recommendations for the Board of Directors), the Montgomery County Water Quality Advisory Group (which advises the Council on water policies) and the Chairman of the WSSC Plumbing Board (which makes policy recommendations regarding the Plumbing Code).  The Bureau Director provides the supervision, management, and administrative control of the Water and Wastewater Divisions.\n\nVI.\tWASTEWATER OPERATIONS DIVISION\t\n\n\tThis Division\u0012s mission is to produce quality effluent which meets all discharge standards, beneficially utilize the biosolids, and operate the sewage pumping stations to collect and transport wastewater without overflows.

The Division is  responsible for the operational readiness of treatment plants currently not in service so that they are capable of being placed back in service when needed.  The Division also provides support for other organizations within the Commission, such as the Systems Maintenance  Division, and the Industrial Discharge Control Section, by assisting in developing research projects and testing.  Support is also given to organizations outside the Commission, such as the US Department of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, Maryland Environmental Services, and the Maryland Department of the Environment.\n\n\tThe Division operates six wastewater treatment plants, with an average daily flow of 73 mgd.  In addition to the six plants, there are thirty-nine (39) wastewater-pumping stations operated by the Division.  Three (3) of the wastewater treatment plants are covered by the CAAA 112 ( r )  requirements; and the other three (3)   do not use the EPA 112 ( r ) listed threshold chemicals.\n\nVII.\tSENECA WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT\n\n\tThe Seneca Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is located at 12600 Great Seneca Highway in Germantown, Maryland.  The Seneca WWTP is currently designed to treat 5.0 million gallons per day (mgd) of wastewater with an expansion in 1999 the plant will have the capacity to treat 20 mgd.   It employs an extended aeration activated sludge process, followed by secondary clarification, gravity sand filtration, chlorination and dechlorination, chemical pH adjustment, and then cascade aeration prior to release into the Great Seneca Creek. The current plant average flow is 4.9 mgd.  Plant biosolids are conditioned with polymer prior to dewatering by belt filter presses.  A contractor for beneficial reuse removes the resulting biosolids for land application.  The plant is staffed 24 hours a day, year round.

Performance has enabled the Seneca WWTP to receive many awards. During 1992-1996, the Seneca WWTP received the annual American Metropolitan Sewage Authority\u0012s (AMSA) Gold Award for no process related NPDES permit non-compliance.  In 1997, the plant received the AMSA Platinum Award for five consecutive years without a process related non-compliance; the plant was one of approximately 30 plants in the nation eligible for this prestigious award.  In 1998, plant personnel were recognized for their hard work by receiving second place in EPA\u0012s National Operation and Maintenance Excellence Award program.  Additionally, the plant is operated so that the actual discharge quality parameters are a mere fraction of the allowable NPDES levels.\n\n\tSeneca WWTP has an active and aggressive safety and training program. Safely operating the plant facilities to protect it and the environment is paramount.   WSSC\u0012s Safety Section and the Plant\u0012s Safety Coordinator train the Plant staff regularly on plant operations, accident prevention, and for emergencies.  Annual training includes: CPR, Lockout/Tagout, Right-to-Know, Personal Protective Equipment, emergency repair of chlorine/sulfur dioxide cylinders, Confined Space Entry, Rescue & Retrieval, etc.  As a WSSC requisite for long term employment, wastewater Plant Operators must pass an examination to become certified by the State of Maryland\u0012s Department of the Environment. This ensures that Plant Operators are fully capable of effectively operating the plant. At Seneca, all Plant Operators are fully certified.  Seneca has an impeccable safety record.

The procedures include initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown and operation, equipment inspections, and emergency planning and response.\n\n\tEmployees currently operating and maintaining the chlorination and dechlorination processes have been trained and tested competent to perform their work duties.  Newly assigned workers will also receive the appropriate training to perform their assigned duties. \n\nThe safety of our employees and the performance of the plant are our primary concerns. WSSC\u0012s Safety Section and the Plant\u0012s Safety Coordinator train the Plant staff regularly on accident prevention and responding to emergencies. Included among the annual training classes are CPR, Lockout/Tagout, Right-to-Know, Personal Protective Equipment, Chlorine/Sulfur Dioxide Cylinder Repair and Leak Response Procedures, Confined Space Entry and Rescue & Retrieval, and First Aid. As a WSSC requisite for long term employment, all wastewater Plant Operators must become fully certified by the State of Maryland\u0012s Department of the Environment by passing examinations. This ensures that Plant Operators are capable of effectively operating the plant. At Seneca, all Plant Operators have State of Maryland certification. Seneca has an excellent safety record, as evidenced by winning the WSSC Wastewater Operations Division Annual Safety Award, which was awarded to the WSSC wastewater treatment plant with the best sa"

Because safety is so important, there have been no releases of sulfur dioxide or chlorine gas to the environment in the history of the plant.\n\nThe plant is designed to provide reliable operations year round. Power to the plant originates from two different electrical sources, providing electrical redundancy and thereby reducing the potential occurrence of a total power outage.  The plant is designed with redundant equipment at every phase of the treatment process. Thus, when an equipment failure occurs, the process can continue producing a high quality final effluent and provide maximum protection to our environment.\n\nIX.\tEMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PLANNING\n\nThe Seneca WFP has an written emergency response and planning program.  A written emergency plan is maintained by on site plant personnel with the support of the WSSC Safety Section.  The plan is consistent with the EPA 40 CFR, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 of the Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and includes: delegation of authority; notification of officials; emergency procedures; and procedures for working with local officials should an emergency create the need for an evacuation of the plant and/or surrounding community. \n\n   Plant personnel are regularly trained on the plan requirements and conduct periodic emergency response drills for a variety of plant emergencies.  The plant personnel and the Safety Section document training.  Some training courses related to emergency response are requirements for Operators to maintain their plant certifications by the Maryland Department of the Environment. \n\nA WSSC staff member from the Safety Section is a member of the Montgomery County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and attends the LEPC meetings in Prince George\u0012s County, the site of Seneca WWTP.
