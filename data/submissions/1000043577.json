This training includes the safe handling of regulated substances under the rule.\nThe City has also developed and maintained a risk management policy that contains general safety rules.  Though these rules do not specifically address the covered processes and their regulated substances, compliance with the general rules significantly reduces the potential for accidental releases of the regulated substances.  This facility complies with industry-standard practices for water treatment plants that use anhydrous ammonia and chlorine in bulk. \nAs for emergency response, the City has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.  In general, the City would deal only with releases of a small amount of a regulated substance.  If the release is determined to be large or if the chemical is stored outside or has migrated outside from a release indoors, the City would immediately notify the City of Fargo Fire Department.\nFor releases that are judged to require the expertise and resources of an established hazardous materials (HAZMAT) team, the facility would call on the services of the jointly operated team comprised of personnel from the cities of Fargo, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota. \nCity management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment at this facility and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in this document.\n\nFacility and regulated substance   \nThe City of Fargo WTP treats surface "

It does this through a series of physical and chemical treatment operations that include pretreatment neutralization, flocculation and sedimentation, primary and secondary softening, ozone disinfection, and final filtration.\nThe treated water, now ready for use by the public, is transferred to a large reservoir and pumped into the distribution system.  The design capacity of the treatment plant is 30 million gallons per day. \nThe regulated substances stored, handled, and used at this facility are anhydrous ammonia and chlorine. The ammonia is stored in one 2,000-gallon tank that is located outside.  The chlorine is stored in one-ton containers with a maximum intended inventory of 25 containers on site.  All of the chlorine containers are stored inside of a building.\n\nAccidental release prevention program\nThe facility's prevention program for both anhydrous ammonia and chlorine complies with EPA's 40 CFR part 68 rule for program 2 processes.  To maintain this compliance, the City has in place many procedural and technological safeguards.  The procedural safeguards include an employee-training program and operating and maintenance procedures for those employees involved in operating the covered processes.  The technological safeguards include controls, sensors, alarms, and industry-standard systems.  All of these serve to prevent unintended releases of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine.\nShould the prevention program fail to prevent a release, the WTP is equipped with engineering controls designed to minimize the effect of the release on the surrounding community.  For chlorine, the storage containers are kept inside of a building to mitigate the effects of a release.  The plant also has a scrubber capable of neutralizing one ton of chlorine, the amount stored in the largest single container onsite.  The scrubber is maintained on a regular basis to ensure proper operation if needed during "

During the filling of the ammonia tank, which occurs only four to five times per year but is the most likely time for a spill or leak, the City Fire Department stands by during the loading operation.  As with chlorine, the equipment in the ammonia process is operated and maintained by personnel properly trained in the hazards of the chemical and the process.\n\nFive-year accident history\nWithin the last five years, this facility has not had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia or chlorine that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency response program  \nThis facility has established and maintains an emergency action plan that is coordinated with local response agencies, such as the City Fire Department and the local HAZMAT team, which is shared with the City of Moorhead, Minnesota.  The goals of the plan are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of the releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  It is also submitted to the Fire Department for review and comment.\nCity employees handle incidental releases of anhydrous ammonia and chlorine and are trained and equipped to do so.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at this facility.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards.\n    During the development of the risk management plan, hazard reviews were conducted with key employees to meet the prevention program requirements.
