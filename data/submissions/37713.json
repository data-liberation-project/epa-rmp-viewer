This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training of personnel  and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our refinery adheres to federal and state regulations,  industry standards and practices process safety policies and guidelines, and best practices that have been developed based on years of former Amoco company and industry experience.  Examples of specific resource material are: the former Amoco Process Safety Booklets, the former Amoco Process Safety Standards and Guideline Manual, the former Amoco Refining Business Group Implementation Guidelines for OSHA 1910.119 and RMP, the former Amoco Recommended Good Practices Manuals, and the former Amoco Corporate Engineering Specifications.  Our policy is to implement controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery is located at 474 West 900 North in Salt Lake City, UT.  The refinery is owned by Tesoro Petroleum Corporation.   The refinery processes 55,000 barrels of crude oil per day in a variety of processes to produce petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), etc.  The refinery has four (4) processes that contain materials above the threshold quantity and are, therefore, covered by the RMP rule. These processes are all classified as Program level 3 processes.  All covered processes contain  regulated flammable mixtures abo"

The flammable mixtures typically contain  various regulated substances such as but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane.\n\n\n\n HAZARD ASSESSMENT RESULTS\n\n\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenarios (WCS):\n\nThe  worst case scenario (WCS) for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) with an overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  The WCS endpoint is based on the instantaneous release of the entire contents of the largest vessel in a process filled to capacity resulting in a VCE.  The effects of administrative controls, mitigation systems, and safety systems are not included in determining the effect of the WCS.  Based on the distances to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, effects from the WCS would reach offsite.  The former owner, BP-Amoco, has calculated the WCS as required by the rule, and has provided detailed information to the EPA and the Salt Lake County and Davis County LEPC's. \n\n\n\nFlammable Alternative Release Scenarios (ARS):\n\nThe alternative release scenario (ARS) for flammable substances at the refinery is a VCE resulting from a release of flammable liquids (primarily butane) from a 2 inch piping leak.  Under this scenario, the release is isolated by operators within 10 minutes.  The distance to the endpoint, calculated using the methodology outlined in the EPA's RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, would reach offsite.   This release scenario was selected based on industry history, and because it is a practical scenario for use in emergency planning and response.  Details concerning the ARS analysis have been provided to the EPA, and the Salt Lake County and Davis County LEPC's. \n\n\n\nToxic WCS/ARS:\n\nThe Tesoro Refining and Marketing Salt Lake City Refinery has no toxic substances in reportable quantities, and therefore, has no worst case or alternate release scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCID"

Because processes at the refinery that are regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to carry out the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the refinery accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the refinery and addresses each accident prevention program element.  In addition, the refinery has a number of initiatives under way that address process safety and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety.  The teams typically have members from various areas of the plant, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management. Examples of these are the Joint Health and Safety Committee and the Area Safety Committees.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.

This information is supplemented by documents that specifically address known corrosion concerns and any known hazards associated with the inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  For specific process areas, the refinery has documented safety-related operating limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in a Safe Operating Limits Table and in Standard Operating Instructions.  The refinery ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).  In addition, tables summarizing the consequences of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to take are readily available.\n\n\n\nThe refinery also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA recommendations is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive prompt attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the Salt Lake City Refinery periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency for the life of the process.

This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Salt Lake City Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in refinery operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After operators demonstrate (e.g., through written and/or oral tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, they can work independently.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

In addition, the Salt Lake City refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities.  Personnel are trained on or informed of all changes to the refinery emergency response program that affect them.\n\n\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Salt Lake City Refinery is coordinated with the Salt Lake and Davis County Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Salt Lake City Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Salt Lake City Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the refinery provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the refinery. \n\n\n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThe Salt Lake City Refinery resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.
