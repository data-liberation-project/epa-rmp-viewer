Accidental release prevention and emergency response polices.                To ensure safe operation and release prevention at Tyson Foods Hope Processing Plant, this facility has implemented The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations Chemical Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119.  All operators of systems containing the threshold amount of hazardous chemicals will undergo Chemical Process Safety Management training and operator training specific to the system. \nTo insure proper response to emergency situations, Tyson Foods Hope Processing Plant, has implemented Emergency Action Plans as required by The Occupational Safety and Health Administrations 29 CFR 1910.38(a) and Emergency Response Plans  29 CFR 1910.120. All safety personnel and operators of the process will be trained in these emergency procedures.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n \tHope Processing Plant is a slaughter and further processing plant.\n \n The regulated substance that the Hope Processing Plant has is Anhydrous Ammonia. The maximum intended inventory is 50,000 lbs.\n  \n3.  The general accidental release prevention program.\n      This facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administrations        Chemical Process Safety Management 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection Agencies Risk Management Program 40 CFR Part 68.  For ammonia systems \n\tTyson Foods, Inc. has adopted the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration guidelines for system operation and maintenance.
