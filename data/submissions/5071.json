      "SummaryText": "General Executive Summary for LaRoche Industries Inc. Donora, PA Distribution Center\n\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at LaRoche Industries Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqueous Ammonia to customers via trailers.  We have 2 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Ammonia (anhydrous) and Ammonia (aqueous) both of which are sold to customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is 702078.00 lb. while Ammonia (aqueous <20%) is present at our facility in a maximum quantity of 67674.55 lb..\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), include administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  To perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's OCA Guidance Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from Anhydrous Ammonia Storage.  In this scenario 196988 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.    At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 6.2 miles is obtaine"

The scenario involves the release of 2380.22 lb. of anhydrous ammonia .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s), deluge system(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).    Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.31 miles.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (conc 20% or greater) involves a release from Aqueous Ammonia Storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3299 lb. of aqueous ammonia .  Toxic liquid is assumed to be released to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 10 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by excess flow valve(s), deluge system(s) and emergency shutdown system(s).

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 04/29/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, LaRoche Industries Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nLaRoche Industries Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nLaRoche Industries Inc. carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at LaRoche Industries Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  LaRoche Industries Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nLaRoche Industries Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\nThere has been only one accidental release of a regulated substance from our facility within the last 5 years.  This release took place on 04/22/1995 and involved 10 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous).  Due to this accident, 1 person offsite received medical treatment.  Onsite, there were no deaths or injuries.  \n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nLaRoche Industries Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.  In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nDonora Fire Department is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n7.\tPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release pr"
