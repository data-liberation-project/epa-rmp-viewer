We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  A summary of results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs (Removed per 2004 update)\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment\n *  The certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  The detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n The Port Arthur,Texas, Refinery is a Prime Fuels operation that also includes extensive non-process related equipment.  The Plant is situated on 3,840 acres where approximately 1,350 acres are occupied by process units and tankage.  We can process approximately 235,000 Barrels Per Day of intermediate and sour crude oils.  Our facility produces gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, and other petroleum products using a variety of processing operations.   In our processes, we use the fol"

      "SummaryText": "lowing chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxics\n\nWe have two toxic chemicals in threshold quantities affected by the rule - chlorine and hydrofluoric acid.\nChlorine is used to treat raw water that is filtered and then used for cooling, steam, and washup in the processes.  It also is injected into the cooling water systems at each cooling tower for control.  Chlorine is delivered to the refinery in one-ton cylinders and dispensed directly into the water with metering devices typically from only one cylinder at a time.  There is only one location that has more than one cylinder hooked up at a time for treating.\nHydrofluoric Acid is used in the manufacturing of gasoline.  It is brought into the refinery in tank trucks and unloaded directly into the unit. \n\nFlammables\n\n We have nine flammables that are affected by the rule - these are propane, propylene, isobutane, butenes, butane, isopentane, isobutylene, isopentane, and pentane.  These flammables are mainly manufactured in the operating processes with purchases of isobutane for use at the HF Alkylation Unit.  The isobutane and butenes are used as charge for the Alkylation Unit.  The other materials are sold as finished products, used for fuel in the refinery, or blended to gasoline. \n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios for our facility.  The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:  NOTE: These scenarios have been remo"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nHydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit 443\n *  Remotely operated \"Emergency Block Valves\"\n *  Water spray mitigation system\n *  Routine Inspection Program\n *  Pump vibration monitoring program\n *  Volatile Organic Compounds checks for fugitive emissions\n *  Hydrocarbon detectors located in acid area of pump row\n *  Hydrofluoric acid detection paint on flanges\n *  Operator training and routine surveillance of equipment\n *  Continuous remote monitoring via cameras and monitors in control room\n\nChlorine Cylinders\n *  Approved vendor that test each cylinder before filling\n *  Leak check on all fittings by operators after hookup\n *  Periodic operator and instrument tech inspection\n *  Written procedure for chlorine handling\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.\n\nOur goal in the refinery is for prevention rat"

The emergency response brigade, made up of highly trained employees, will be on the scene in a matter of minutes to help or take over the mitigation depending on the circumstances.\n\n FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nPremcor keeps records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  At the Port Arthur Refinery we have not had any accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nIf any future incidents occur, Premcor will conduct formal incident investigations to identify and correct the root causes of the events.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nPremcor maintains emergency response and spill response contingency plans, which comply with all federal, state, and local regulatory requirements.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\nWe have developed procedures that outline the emergency actions to be taken as required. This is the Emergency Response Action Plan. The ERAP is located on the EH&S Website where it can be quickly accessed by all employees. Each covered location has emergency procedures that are peculiar to that location, as well as, the overall refinery plan. Our overall plan is coordinated with the community and joint training takes place on an annual basis which includes our Emergency Response Team and local emergency responders. The notification system for the refinery is also outlined in the ERAP. Outside notification is made as required under the regulations and outside help is called upon as deemed necessary.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to"
