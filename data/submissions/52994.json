      "SummaryText": "Facility and Substance Overview\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson, Sales & Logistics Company, LLC distribution center located in Tobyhanna, PA distributes consumer health products for various consumer products companies that fall within the J&J Group of Consumer Companies.   The aerosol products stored and distributed primarily include the following trade names; Band-Aid Calamine Spray, Micatin, Neosporin Anti-Fungal Spray, Neutrogena Sun Block Spray and Aveeno Sun Block Spray.  These products each use various amounts (or none) of the following propellants [Butane (#106-97-8), Isobutane (#75-28-5), Methyl Ether (#115-10-6), Pentane (#109-66-0)].  \n\nThe consumer aerosol products are typically in metal containers, less than 8 ounces in size, including the product ingredients, as well as the propellants.  The individual containers are typically packaged in corrugated shippers.  The shippers are typically stacked on a pallet, on which there may be 1,000-2,000 individual containers.\n\nThe palletized loads are stored in steel pallet rack equipped with NFPA Scheme-A fire protection (heat baffling and in-rack sprinklers).  The Fontana facility warehouse is approximately 1,373,400ft2.  The facility warehouse is split into three buildings with a fire rated wall between the buildings.  In addition to the NFPA Scheme-A fire protection for the flammables and combustibles, there is ESFR fire protection throughout the general warehouse.  There are 24-hour security personnel and systems monitoring the facility for a potential event.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nOver the previous five years the Tobyhanna Distribution Center has experienced no accidental releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, evacuations or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe Worst-Case scenario was performed based on the EPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.   Based on the assumption that the entire"

The calculated distances do not extend beyond the site property line (no offsite receptors are impacted).  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency and a potential release of flammable materials within the facility, Local Emergency Responders (Coolbaugh Township Fire Department) would be contacted through the use of 911; secondary contact would be made to the Monroe County Office of Emergency Services (570-992-4113).   \n\nEmployees of Genco and Johnson & Johnson Sales & Logistics are trained and instructed to evacuate through the nearest exit in the event of a release, fire or other evacuation signal.  Employees are not responsible for any action required to contain a release or to extinguish a fire.   Emergency Response Plans and Procedures include a Hazardous Materials Inventory Summary.\n \n\nSafety/ Risk Assessment\n\nJohnson & Johnson, Sales & Logistics Company contracts Factory Mutual (FM) Global for Risk Assessment and underwriting.  At least annually, FM audits the facility with a team of engineers for the purpose of minimizing potential risk of catastrophic events."
