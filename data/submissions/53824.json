The facility is located on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids at the intersection of 41st Avenue Drive and C Street Southwest.  This ISO 9000:2000 certified facility employs 108 people and operates under a team-based organizational structure.\n\nIn March of 1999 GCOR initiated an effort to enhance the existing management system for the site.  This effort was guided by sustainable development principles and incorporated equity, environmental and economic drivers into the site\u00bfs management system.  We feel that this \u00bfpeople/plant/profit\u00bf approach to our everyday business is a sound basis for the pursuit of long-term business viability while taking responsibility for improving the environmental, social, and economic conditions resulting from our activities.  Site goals and on-going initiatives are tracked through yearly measures, which are issued through Danisco\u00bfs annual Sustainability Report.  Danisco\u00bfs last Sustainability Report can be found at www.danisco.com/sustainability.\n\nThe facility manufactures enzymes through a fermentation based process.  Enzymes are chemicals comprised of large proteins and have been used in the food and detergent manufacturing industries for many years.  The facility\u00bfs enzyme products are available in liquid or granular form.  The facility operates a continuous 24-hour-per-day process and has on-shift maintenance and laboratory support.  Staff support includes site management, environmental health and safety, engineering, purchasing, finance, and systems personnel.\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is the regulated substance under EPA Risk Management criteria.  The enzyme manufacturing process requires the use of ammonium hydroxide at 29.9% concentration.  Average on-site storage of ammonium hydroxide solution is approximately 37,000 liters, equal to 21,887 p"

Systems are engineered with safety and environmental aspects in mind, with input from all affected areas of the plant prior to construction or use.  The goal is to provide a safe workplace while minimizing environmental impact.  Release prevention methods are implemented where possible, including computer controls, automation, containment of all outdoor tanks and indoor sump areas, and on-site air scrubbing and neutralization capabilities.\n\nThe site\u00bfs management team is committed to the implementation of site environmental health and safety programs and supports the following.\n\nThe environmental health and safety budget is established to provide:\nAppropriate and adequate personal protective equipment\nAppropriate and post-offer and annual medical examinations\nTraining\nAir monitoring equipment and analysis\nHazardous waste pick-up for a conditionally exempt small quantity hazardous waste generator\nEmergency response team equipment and supplies\n\nA site Safety Committee is in place to foster the plant\u00bfs overall safety performance.

The facility has 24-hour team-based operations coverage in the facility including a full service maintenance department.  The facility also operates under ISO 9000:2000 certification which ensures among other things that procedures are updated and used for plant operations in addition to proper handling of all documents.\n\nThe presence of an Emergency Response Team ensures that all safety and environmental events are addressed immediately to prevent the escalation of the incident if possible.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no accidents at GCOR involving the ammonium hydroxide system that resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.\n\nChanges to Improve Safety\n\nAs part of an on-going safety review, a Process Hazard Analysis was conducted for the site ammonium hydroxide system in January of 2009.  The was led by an experienced outside consultant and completed with a team of GCOR members representing Logistics (process), Fermentation (process), Maintenance, Engineering, and Environmental Health and Safety.  Four recommendations for investigation and improvement were generated from the Process Hazard Analysis.  The action items were completed by the end of January 2009."
