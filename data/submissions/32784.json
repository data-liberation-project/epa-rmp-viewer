Utilities Division, owns and operates a 6.0 MGD wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) serving approximately 14,100 customers and a service area population of 40,500 people.  \n\nThe Ormond Beach WWTP uses chlorine as a disinfection agent and sulfur dioxide as a dechlorination agent for effluent being discharged into the Halifax River.  The Ormond Beach WWTP stores as much as 16,000 lbs of chlorine gas in one-ton cylinders and 4,000 lbs of sulfur dioxide gas in one-ton cylinders.  The City of Ormond Beach developed a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical storage and feed facilities in June 1999, in accordance with 40 CFR 68 and 29 CFR 1910.119 (OSHA Process Safety Management Standards). The EPA Chemical Accident Protection rule (40CFR68) applies to any process that involves more than 2,500 pounds of chlorine (gas) or more than 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. The OSHA Process Safety Management standard (29CFR1910.119) applies to any process that involves more than 1,500 pounds of chlorine or more than 1,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide. The City?s RMP was submitted to EPA using the agency?s RMP Submit program.\n\nA compliance audit of the Ormond Beach WWTP RMP was conducted in May 2004, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 68.79.  The audit concluded that the Ormond Beach Utilities Division was in general compliance with the RMP prepared in June 1999.  \n\nThere has been one minor incident reported in the last five (5) years with no off- site chemical release resulting. The incident was investigated in accordance with the RMP procedures and it was concluded that the chlorine odor detected by the operator most likely resulted from a routine venting of the chlorine regulator.\n\nRMP Summary\nThe Ormond Beach WWTP RMP is organized as follows:\n\nSection 1 ? Introduction\n\nThis section provides a general overview of the WWTP RMP components and requ"

Program Management Procedures\n\nThis section describes the management elements of the RMP, including definition of personnel roles and responsibilities, employee participation, pre-startup safety review including checklists, Management of Change procedures and forms, incident investigation procedures, inspections and compliance audit requirements, on-going program maintenance, including updates and development of continuing improvements, and RMP public information procedures used by the City.\n\n\nSection 3 ? Process Safety Information\n\nThis section provides a thorough presentation of the physical properties, chemistry and hazards associated with chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and descriptions of the chemical storage and feed process technology, and equipment.  Applicable requirements for material of construction, ventilation, monitoring, design code compliance, and safety systems are described.\n\nSection 4 ? Process Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n    Hazard analyses for the chlorination and sulfur dioxide systems were conducted by the Utilities Division Staff using the ?what-if checklist? methodology.  The PHA developed in June 1999, as a part of the City?s original RMP submittal was reviewed in May 2004, as part of the RMP re-submittal and found to be adequate.  The majority of the recommendations made in the 1999 PHA have been implemented, with only a few minor exceptions.  \n\n    The potential impacts of possible future chlorine release were analyzed in accord with the guidance that USEPA set in its Risk Management Program Guidance for POTWs.  The analysis determines the distance at which the plume would dilute to a concentration at which people would suffer no serious permanent harm, but would voluntarily go to the hospital for evaluation.  The ?toxic endpoint? for chlorine and sulfur dioxide is 0.0087 milligram per liter and 0.0078 milligrams per liter, respectively. For the worst case scenario, it is assumed that a ton container will completely empty in ten "

In the worst possible case, the EPA table yields a ?distance to toxic endpoint? of the 1.30 miles for the type of landscape (urban) in which the plant is located.  Within the 1.30 mile radius of the plant, there are schools, a hospital, recreation areas, commercial/office sites, and residences.  An estimated 9,100 people live within a 1.30 mile radius of the plant, based  on population projections using 2000 Census data.  \n\n    The potential impacts of more likely possible chlorine or sulfur dioxide releases were analyzed in accord with the guidance that USEPA set in its Risk Management Program Guidance for POTWs.  The City evaluated a release involving a break in a chlorine or sulfur dioxide transfer line attached to a ton container operating in the vapor transfer mode.  The valve on the chlorine/SO2 ton container (which has a diameter of 5/16?) would constrict the flow.  The EPA method shows a chlorine/SO2 release rate of 15 pounds per minute and a ?distance to toxic endpoint? of 528 feet for the type of landscape (urban) in which the plant is located.  There are no offsite consequences for the alternative release scenario.  \n\nSection 5 ? Employee Training\n\n    This section describes the City?s employee training program for the covered chemicals. Ormond Beach has developed and conducted regular, structured training for Ormond Beach employees covering various aspects of the covered processes. Training record forms document the training conducted and employees receiving the subject training.  The training record forms are kept on file at the WWTP.\n\nSection 6 ? Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Sulfur Dioxide System\n\nSection 7 ? Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Chlorination System\n\nSection 8 ? Safe Work Practices\n\n    These three sections provide a thorough description of the processes, specifications and operating procedures for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide chemical systems.  "

      "SummaryText": "The SOPs are developed in a ?step-by-step? format and include procedural checklists to ensure conformity with the procedures.  The SOPs included in the RMP document address start-up, shut-down, inspection, temporary operation, emergency procedures, trouble-shooting, cylinder deliveries, system maintenance, safe work practices for handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and working in and around chlorine/sulfur dioxide facilities.\n\nSection 9 ? Contractor Safety Program\n\n    Pre-qualification requirements for all contractors working in or around the chlorine and sulfur dioxide facilities are included in Section 9 of the program document. In addition, this section presents guidelines that contractors must follow to conduct work in a safe manner.\n\nSection 10 ? Emergency Response Program\n\n    This section documents the procedures to be followed to control process upsets and chemical leaks.  The ERP provides procedures to be followed by wastewater personnel for handling minor control process upsets and/or chemical releases.\n\n    For major control process upset or chemical releases, the ERP calls for the Ormond Beach HAZMAT team (division of the City fire department) to be the first responders.  After notifying the HAZMAT team of a major release occurrence, WWTP personnel are to evacuate the area and allow HAZMAT personnel to take the appropriate emergency response and public notification actions.\n\n    Also included in this section are contact names and phone numbers for notification of authorities, plant site evacuation plan for major releases, and post-incident reporting requirements.  \n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Process Safety\n\n1.    The City has recently issued a request for proposals (RFP) for the design and construction of the necessary facilities to convert the chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas systems to liquid sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfate storage and feed systems.  The elimination of chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas systems will significantly diminish the risk to WWTP em"
