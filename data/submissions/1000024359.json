The facility is located at 360 164th Street, South Sioux City, Nebraska 68776.  The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  The facility has approximately 390 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\nI. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe facility has developed and implemented a Process Safety Management Program (PSM) in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection AgencyAA?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68 as their accidental release prevention program.  The system is continuously monitored by computer based controls that alert technicians that are trained, qualified, and experienced in ammonia refrigeration in accordance with the facilityAA?s PSM program.  The system is visually inspected periodically for proper operation daily.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.  Safe operation of the system will be accomplished by utilizing general good operating procedures and providing appropriate training to employees.\n\nThis facility has developed and implemented a written Emergency Action Plan as defined in \n29 CFR 1910.38 as their emergency response program.  Emergency evacuation drills are conducted on a periodic basis to ensure personnel quickly and safely evacuate the plant. This facility will utilize outside agencies and/or organizations to perform emergency response measures in the event of a fire, explosion or hazardous material release.\n\nII.

      "SummaryText": "57,000 square feet of space.  The facility utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to keep products at temperature and preserve food safety standards.  The major components of the ammonia system are located in the mechanical room.  The system is a two stage refrigeration cycle.  In addition, anhydrous ammonia converted to ammonium hydroxide, is used as a processing aid in the production of beef products at the facility and is an approved antimicrobial treatment by the USDA food safety inspection service. Support operations include a maintenance shop, weld shop, parts warehouse area, and administrative offices.\n\nThis facility also uses Anhydrous ammonia as a manufacturing aid as part of its process.  Food Grade Ahydrous ammoina is sparged at very low levels into the product during processing to alter the pH of the product enough to have a microbial reduction benifit in the final product.  The ammonia used for this purpose is stored separately on site from the refrigeration system but the two system are in very close proximity to each other.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is listed as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds.  The operating capacity of each system exceeds this threshold.\n\nIII. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical AA? Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nThis facility complies with the provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health AdministrationAA?s Process Safety Management Program 29 CFR 1910.119 and the Environmental Protection AgencyAA?s Risk Management Program 40 CFR 68.  The facilityAA?s PSM program includes provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant c"

      "SummaryText": "hanges to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM/RMP management of change provisions stated in the facilityAA?s plan.\n\nThe ammonia system is controlled and monitored 24/7 by an Operations Center from a remote location.  The system is equipped with a series of redundant fail safe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The system canAA?t be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The system is equipped with ammonia detectors that alarm and start local exhaust ventilation system when the presence of ammonia is sensed above set point levels in the engine room.  The system can be manually shutdown using a kill switch located outside the engine room.\n\nIV. Five Year Accident History\n\nThere has been one reportable accident history in the last five years. On 01/03/10 at approximately 5:22 a.m. during production start-up of the facility, the Thermosyphon Vessel over pressurized due to the waterline to the condenser freezing up. Outside air temperature was -20 F.  The Vessel Safety Relief Valves activated, Refrigeration system was shut down. Estimated length of discharge was 18 minutes and the calculated amount released was 447 lbs of ammonia.  There were no injuries and no evacuation of the facility as a result of this release. \n\nV. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department and outside contractors to respond to emergencies involving anhydrous ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic drills.\n\nBeef Products, Inc. has notified the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility's emergency action plan includes procedures for notifying the proper agencies in the event of a reportable release of ammonia.  \n\nVI. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe fa"
