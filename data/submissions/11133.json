Introduction\n\nThis Executive Summary briefly reviews the major elements of the Risk Management Plan for Decatur - 3M Company in Decatur AL.  We take seriously our safety, health and environmental responsibilities for our employees and the community.  As an operating unit of 3M, we share in a tradition of environmental, health and safety responsibility.  3M was an early pioneer in pollution prevention and created its environmental policy in 1975.  Since 1990, 3M has cut its worldwide volatile organic air emissions 80 percent, and releases to water 75 percent.\n\n2.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is our goal to prevent accidental releases of regulated and other materials through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of our manufacturing processes and the proper training of our employees.  If, despite our efforts, such a release should occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control the effects of the release.  We also maintain an excellent working relationship with the Decatur Fire Department who can provide additional rapid and effective response.  \n\n3.  The Stationary Source and The Regulated Substances Handled\n\nWe manufacture specialty films and specialty chemicals for use in making a wide variety of products from video cassette duplicator tape to fabric protection products.  We use 10 regulated substances at our facility in quantities regulated by EPA's Risk Management Program.  3M employees are trained and experienced in working with these substances.  We contribute to their safety and health by providing high quality manufacturing processes, equipment and maintenance.\n\nThe following regulated substances are used at Decatur - 3M Company:\n\n     Hydrogen fluoride, Chlorine, Epichlorohydrin, Ethyl Amine, Methyl Amine, and Phosphorus Oxychloride    are all key raw materials used to make various products such as fabric pro"

These CFC replacements may be used in the manufacture of semiconductors and in depositing special lubricants on memory discs for computers.\n\n     Propylene and Vinylidene fluoride are used as raw materials in the production of synthetic rubber products that are used in the production of many automobiles.  \n     \n     Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) is used as a reactant in a scrubber system in order to help control chlorine emissions.\n\n     Although Propane is not curently regulated under RMP, we are voluntarily including our use of propane in this Risk Management Plan.  Propane is used as a backup fuel source for various processes that typically use natural gas.\n\n4.  Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and Alternative Release Scenario(s)\n\nEPA has directed all affected facilities to share with their communities a look at the worst possible accident that could happen at the facility, as unlikely as that might be, and an alternative, more realistic, accident scenario.  To evaluate accidental release scenarios, we have used the look-up tables and equations provided by the EPA in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance as well as Equations from Appendix D of the EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 3 toxic substances as a class involves a gaseous release of Hydrogen Fluoride for a duration of 10 minutes.  \n\nOne alternative release scenario will be submitted for each toxic substance present in Program 3 processes cumulatively.  In taking a conservative approach to choosing the alternate case scenarios, credit was not given to all potential mitigation measures that are inherent to the processes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydrogen fluoride involves a gaseous release from process piping in the Hydrogen Fluoride process for a duration of 10 minutes"

      "SummaryText": ". The release is  assumed to be controlled by passive mitigation which includes a building enclosure.   \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Chlorine involves a gaseous release resulting from a scrubber malfunction in the Continuous Chlorination System.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Epichlorohydrin involves a liquid release from a transfer line in the Epichlorohydrin Storage and Transfer process.  Toxic liquid is assumed  to be immediately released to form a pool 1 cm high from which evaporation takes place.  Passive mitigation in the form of a dike is taken into account to calculate the scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous) involves a gaseous release from a blown rupture disk in the Continuous Chlorination System.    \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Phosphorus oxychloride involves a liquid release from a  drum.  Toxic Liquid is assumed to be immediately released to form a pool of height 1 cm, from which evaporation takes place.  Passive mitigation in the way of an enclosure is taken into account to calculate the scenario.  \n\nThe worst case release scenario for Program 3 flammable substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the Propylene Storage Tank in the Propylene storage and transfer process.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is released as a vapor, which finds an ignition source.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Program 3 flammable substances involves a release from the Propylene Storage Tank transfer line.  The release is assumed to result in a Vapor Cloud Explosion.  \n\n5.  Decatur - 3M Company Program to Prevent Accidental Releases\n\nAt Decatur - 3M Company, we take great care to prevent accidents, including those not covered under the EPA's Risk Management Program.  \n\nWe have programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management requirements from OSHA, and all notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Comm"

We encourage 3M employees to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\n     Contractors - On occasion, Decatur - 3M Company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance.  We have a policy of informing contractors of known potential hazards related to our processes and the contractor's work.  Contractors are also informed of our procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n6.  Five-year Accident History\n\nAt Decatur - 3M Company, no level of accident is acceptable.  We work continually to reduce the number and severity of accidents at our operations.  Within the past five years there were two significant releases of regulated substances from our facility.  The first took place on 06/12/95, involving 80 pounds of hydrogen fluoride and injuring one employee.  There was no impact on anyone offsite or on the environment.  Another release, of 20 pounds of sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), occurred on 04/28/98, injuring one employee.  There was no offsite impact.  As part of our effort to eliminate accidents, both accidents were investigated by 3M and actions were taken to reduce the risk of similar accidents in the future.  \n\n7.

Our emergency response plan is updated to reflect any pertinent changes in our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\nDecatur - 3M Company participates in the Chemical Manufacturers Assosciatio's Responsible Care Program.\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAt Decatur - 3M Company, we strive to continually improve safety at the plant.  Our efforts range from designing safety into our manufacturing operations to regular assessments identifying opportunities for safety improvements.  Important new elements in our continuous improvements programs are: 1) Construct a Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) unloading facility that will help mitigate an HF release from the unloading operation in the unlikely event that such a release should occur.  2) Introduce a process that distills HF from process waste material for recycling which reduces waste and minimizes the hazardous nature of the waste.\n\nIn addition, Decatur - 3M Company is implementing an updated corporate policy to make safety a greater part of every employee's responsibility.  This policy encourages employees to identify any situations they perceive to be unsafe, as well as any opportunities to improve safety."
