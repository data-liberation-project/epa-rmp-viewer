      "SummaryText": "LPS Laboratories is located at 4647 Hugh Howell Road in Tucker, Georgia.  This is a manufacturing facility that packages aerosol cleaners, lubricants, and corrosion inhibitors used in industrial applications.  There is one 14,700 gallon tank on the property used for storage of a propane/isobutane blend used as an aerosol propellant.  The aerosol filling process that uses this blend is conducted in an enclosed gas house that is equiped with a leak detection and emergency shutdown system.\n\nIt is LPS Laboratories' policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws to prevent an accidental release.  Our worst case scenario would affect the surrounding industrial area within a 0.3 mile radius.  There are no schools, hospitals, or residences within that distance, and no environmental receptors would be affected.  The alternate case scenario would affect the surrounding industrial area withing a 0.2 mile radius. LPS has never had an accident involving propane/isobutane propellant that caused death, injury, or property or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility was designed to comply with the NFPA-30b, 1994 edition, \"Code for the Manufacture and Storage of Aerosol Products\".  The aerosol filling process is compliant with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Dekalb County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department and members of the fire department have inspected our propane/isobutane system.  The fire department is prepared with the equipment and trained personnel to respond effectively to an emergency involving a release of propane/isobutane propellant.\n\nWe have no plans at the present time to change our safety processes and procedures."
