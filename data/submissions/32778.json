Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThe City of Wenatchee Wastewater Treatment Plant facility\u00bfs (herein after referred to as Wenatchee WWTP) accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  It is the policy of the City of Wenatchee to adhere to all applicable federal and state safety and environmental regulations.\n\nAt the Wenatchee WWTP chlorine is primarily used on-site to disinfect wastewater.  Chlorine is considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is listed on the Extremely Hazardous Substance (EHS) list.  The chemical properties of chlorine make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling in order to prevent unnecessary human exposure and reduce the risk to personnel and the community.\n\nWenatchee WWTP\u00bfs emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans and training of employees.  Wenatchee WWTP has trained its personnel in the safe handling of chlorine including training in the use of personal protective equipment and chlorine \u00bfpatch\u00bf kits.\n\nB. Facility and Regulated Substances Handled\nThe Wenatchee WWTP is a wastewater treatment plant located at 201 North Worthen Street, Wenatchee, Chelan County, Washington.   The treatment plant is located next to the Columbia River and adjacent to industrial and recreational areas.\n\nThe regulated substance used at the Wenatchee WWTP is chlorine (CAS# 7782-50-5).   The chlorine is used disinfect wastewater.  Four thousand pounds (two 1-ton cylinders) is the maximum amount of chlorine stored on-site.  Chlorine is consumed at the approximate rate of 119 pounds per day; therefore the actual amount of chlorine on-site is usually less than 4,000 pounds.  \n\nThe Wenatchee WWTP uses other hazardous substances on-site, but they are not listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  However, the City of Wenatchee believes in the concept set forth in the \u00bfGeneral Duty Clause\u00bf of the"

To this effect, the City of Wenatchee has established policies, procedures, and training to reduce the risk of an accidental hazardous substance release for the safety of its employees and surrounding communities.\n\nC. Worst Case and Alternative Scenarios\nThe off-site consequence analysis of the worst case and alternative scenarios were reviewed and no changes were made.\n\nD. General Accidental Release Prevention Program\nThe Wenatchee WWTP\u00bfs accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n-\tTraining of personnel\n-\tPreventative maintenance program\n-\tUse of safety equipment\n-\tUse of accurate and effective written operating procedures\n\nThe Wenatchee WWTP complies with OSHA and Washington State process safety management, applicable state safety and environmental regulations, The Chlorine Institute Manual for safe handling of chlorine, and the Uniform Fire Code.    The chlorination system was installed to standards and local code at the time of installation.  Other safety systems utilized at the Regional Water facility include:\n-\tChlorine detection alarm that triggers an alarm and light indicator on the control panel in the control room.  After hours this alarm triggers an auto-dialer which contacts the operator on-call.\n-\tAppropriate overhead crane for handling the 1-ton cylinders.\n-\tEmergency exhaust fan and re-circulating fan.\n-\tProper fitting and closing doors.\n\nOperating procedures and checklists have been prepared by the Wenatchee WWTP to be used by employees performing operational duties.  Procedures are kept in the control room.  These procedures include:\n-\tStart up procedures\n-\tRoutine operations\n-\tMaintenance\n-\tResponse to major and minor releases\n-\tEmergency action plan\n\nE. Five Year Accident History\nThe Wenatchee WWTP has not had any accidents involving chlorine in the last five years.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\nIn addition to the operating procedures, Wenatchee WWTP has established Emergency Response Guideline"

These procedures are part of the ongoing training of personnel and include responding to a chlorine release and public warning and notification.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\nThe Wenatchee WWTP is currently under construction.  One of the upgrades will be replacing the chlorination system with UV disinfection.  The chlorine gas will be removed by December 2005.  The City of Wenatchee will also continue to ensure ongoing training and review of safety policies and procedures."
