Waldbaum Company to conduct business in a manner that is safe to the employees, the community and the environment.  The Company's officers, managers and supervisors are accountable to carry out the policies of the Company relevant to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous materials.  M.  G.  Waldbaum Company has made a determined effort to develop a plan to prevent releases of extremely hazardous substances.  Procedures to assist in the prevention of extremely hazardous material releases are set forth in EPA's Risk Management Program.  In the event of a release, the Emergency Response Plan will be the guidance for responding to, containing and reporting such releases.  The Response Plan includes an incident command system for decision-making authority for each stage of a release situation.  The Company will coordinate with public responders and emergency services in ensuring safety of the public.\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nM.  G.  Waldbaum Company processes egg products.  To prevent contamination with harmful bacteria and to freeze the final product, ammonia is used.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain cool to freezing temperatures in the various stages of the process.  The refrigeration system is a closed loop system, meaning the ammonia is continually reused.\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nM.  G.  Waldbaum Company has developed models of the releases at this facility and the potential affected areas.  A commercial computer model, Phast Professional, was used to develop the models.\n\nThe worst-case release of ammonia involves the sudden failure of the Intercooler when used as a storage vessel which has the capacity to hold 11,000 pounds of ammonia.  Depending on wind direction, residences, schools, hospitals and businesses at a distance of 1.5 miles could be affected.  Approximately 181 people live within a 1.5 mile radius of the facility.  Th"

      "SummaryText": "is type release is not likely to occur because of the stringent construction codes for pressure vessels and annual inspections of the pressure vessels.\n\nThe alternative release of ammonia involves the failure of a 3/4 inch line on the Intercooler releasing 5,400 pounds of liquid ammonia over a 51 minute period.  Residences up to 0.22 mile from the release would be affected.  Approximately 14 people live within a 0.22 mile radius of the facility.  This release was selected because appurtenances are more likely to be broken.  Protective devices are put in place to protect lines from traffic and accidental breaking.\n\nRELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nM.  G.  Waldbaum Company has set forth in its policies the importance of operating safely.  The Company has aggressively developed programs, policies and materials requirements to minimize the possibility of releases.  These programs include compliance with appropriate OSHA and EPA regulations and sound safety practices.  Stringent material and contractor requirements have been developed to assure that materials and work conform to recognized standards.  Training for employees is conducted to maintain a high level awareness when working with hazardous materials.\n\nAs part of the Prevention Program, M.G. Waldbaum has developed a method to evaluate the Risk Management Program.  This method includes periodic evaluation of the Program utilizing a Process Hazard Analysis, and Compliance Audits. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nM.  G.  Waldbaum Company has had an accidental release as defined in 40 CFR 68.42(a) during the last five years.  The accident mainly cause property damage.  There were some residences evacuated with less than 5 residences requiring medical attention.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\n\nOn-site emergency response teams train to respond to releases to effectively minimize the release.  Joint response training is conducted with local emergency service organizations (i.e. fire, police, rescue, etc.)  Drills are conducted period"
