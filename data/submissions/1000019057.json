California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program - Title 19 CCR, Chapter 4.5\nA?    Federal EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) - Title 40 CFR A?68\nA?    California Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 8 CCR A?5189\nA?    Federal Process Safety Management (PSM) Program, Title 29 CFR A?1910.119\n\nHereafter this program will be referred to as the RMP-PSM program.\n\nThis program is intended to be a \"living document\".  As such, the information, procedures, policies, and documentation that make up this program must be made easily accessible and updated as necessary.  To accomplish this, Eastside Packing has elected to use PSMWriter&copy;, software developed and distributed by Resource Compliance, Inc.  This software will assist us with updating, maintaining, scheduling, and tracking RMP-PSM related activities. \n\n1.1    EASTSIDE PACKING, RISK & PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM \n\nThis is to inform all interested persons, including employees, that Eastside Packing has updated/developed their unified RMP-PSM Program.

The program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of hazardous chemicals.  Overall, the program is designed to prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\nEastside Packing has an exemplary safety record, one that we are quite proud of.  Our company has many policies and procedures in place to promote overall plant, worker and public safety.  We have: \n\n1.    Prepared a unified prog"

Utilized PSMWriter&copy; software to ensure that all necessary Eastside Packing employees have access to relevant information (SOPs, PHAs, audits, etc.)\nThe RMP-PSM program sets forth rules, procedures and practices that will help our employees protect themselves and our neighbors.\n\n1.2    PROCESS DESCRIPTION\nEastside Packing, Inc. operates a cold storage facility for citrus products.  The facility has one ammonia refrigeration system. The system provides refrigeration capacity to multiple cold rooms, some of which are equipped with forced air tunnels for cooling fruit.  The four rooms with forced air tunnels are designated as \"precooling\" rooms, while the ten other rooms are called cold storage rooms.  Both kinds of rooms are equipped with \"bunker style\" evaporator coils that contain chilled liquid ammonia.  There is a cooled loading dock and hallway as well.  A computer system provides substantial control and alarm capability.\n\nThe system operates as follows: high pressure liquid from the high pressure receivers are piped to each cold room or refrigerated zone, where it passes through an expansion valve into a low pressure accumulator vessel mounted on the roof or behind a bunker wall.  Low temperature liquid circulates by thermal convection through the evaporator coils in the refrigerated spaces.  Low pressure and temperature gas collects in the accumulator vessels, and passes through a pressure regulator into a suction line.  The suction line returns the vapor to the main suction accumulator vessels located in the engine room, which separates any residual liquid from the gas.  The gas is piped to refrigeration compressors which elevate the temperature and pressure of the gas.  The high pressure discharge from the compressors is sent to water cooled evaporative condensers where the high pressure g"

      "SummaryText": "as ammonia is liquefied and returned to the high pressure receivers. Liquid separated from the suction return gas in the main suction accumulator vessels drains into liquid transfer vessels.  Operation of a float switch activated solenoid valve raises the pressure in the liquid transfer vessels to the point the liquid can be drained into the high pressure receivers.  \n\nThe facility was built by professional refrigeration engineers more than 20 years ago in accordance with industry standards at the time of construction. The facility has changed names during that period.  It has previously been called King Canyon Cold Storage and then Ballantine Plant 2.  It was also built in compliance with the Uniform Mechanical Code and Uniform Building Code applicable at the time of construction. The system contains numerous safety devices including sensors which stop the compressors if temperatures or pressures exceed or drop below established limits, and safety relief valves which vent ammonia gas to the atmosphere if the pressure in the system exceeds their set point.  In addition, ammonia detectors are located throughout the facility, and will shut down equipment if ammonia is detected.  Lastly, an emergency \"dump box\" contains switches and valves to turn off equipment and vent ammonia if necessary.\n\nThe ammonia system at this facility consists of vessels which are interconnected, or which are co-located such that a release of ammonia could impact the ability to operate vessels that are not directly connected.  Therefore, we are treating the system as a single process.\n\n1.3    GENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE & CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n1.3.1    GENERAL \nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings.  During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\nEastside Packing has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis o"

The results of the analyses are reported in the body of the program. \n\n1.3.2    ANHYDROUS AMMONIA\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the Eastside Packing facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner.  Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep an active log book of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia.  In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment. \n\n1.4    FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nEastside Packing has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\n\n1.5    EMERGENCY ACTION AND RESPONSE PLAN\nEastside Packing's emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\nA?    California \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 8 CCR A?3220\nA?    Federal \"Emergency Action Plan\" - Title 29 CFR A?1910.38 \nStrategically, we will respond \"minimally\" to a release.  Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility.  All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.  \nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\n\n1.6    PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nOur company has an outstanding safety record, one that we are quite proud of.

Nevertheless, Eastside Packing continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\n\nBy utilizing PSMWriter&copy; software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program.  This has improved Eastside Packing's ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors.  In addition, PSMWriter&copy; tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that Eastside Packing's management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\nEastside Packing has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program.  When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter&copy;, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date.  Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter&copy; as well.  A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter&copy;.\n\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter&copy; to create, schedule, track, and document events, Eastside Packing has also entered into a contract with California Controlled Atmosphere to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation. \n\nFor the future, Eastside Packing now thinks of the RMP-PSM program as a \"living document\".  It is an interactive framework that guides safe action for Eastside Packing employees, but allows for feedback and continual improvement.  Through the RMP-PSM program Eastside Packing will continue to maintain overall plant worker and public safety. \n"
