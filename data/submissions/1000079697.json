It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency were to occur, we would implement our Emergency Response Plan based on the level of the emergency.  The site maintains an emergency brigade capable of handling the majority of emergencies the site may experience.  Outside aide is also available from the Little Hocking Fire Department and the Belpre Fire Department.  Traffic control, when necessary, is provided by the Washington County Sheriff's Department.  In addition, Kraton has joined with other companies in an organization known as COVIEO, whose purpose is to furnish fire fighting equipment and first aid material to a distressed member company.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe"

Our facility includes four polymer production units, a compounding unit, steam generation, wastewater treatment, and other support services.  We store the following RMP regulated substances (chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release) in our processes in quantities greater than the thresholds listed in 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nChemical                           Use                         Hazard\n\n1,3-Butadiene                           Raw Material                 Flammable\n\nEthyl Ether [Ethane,1,1 oxybis-]       Processing Aid                 Flammable\n\nHydrogen                           Raw Material                 Flammable\n\nIsoprene [1,3-butadiene,2-methyl-]     Raw material                 Flammable\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help effectively manage the hazards that may be posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by the use of these chemicals on this site.\n\n\n\nWORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE CASE SCENARIOS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for the RMP involves the complete loss of the contents of the 1,3-Butadiene storage tank. In this scenario, a catastrophic failure of the vessel occurs, and its entire contents are released nearly immediately (in under 1 minute). This failure and release results in a vapor cloud explosion in which the entire mass of 1,3-butadiene is consumed. The estimated distance to the 1 psi overpressure endpoint of 1 psi (as calculated by USEPA's RMP*Comp) is 1.4 miles. This distance to the endpoint extends offsite and includes public receptors within its range. \n\n\n\nOur alternate case flammable scenario is a pressure relief valve lifting on a vaporizer vessel at the 1,3-Butadiene barge unloading facility occurring for 1 minute.

Facility operations and activities are regulated by rules from a number of Agencies, including US EPA, Ohio EPA, and OSHA.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs as noted in the OSHA Process Safety Management System including:\n\n\n\n    Process safety information\n\n    Process hazard analysis\n\n    Operating procedures\n\n    Training\n\n    Mechanical integrity\n\n    Management of change\n\n    Pre-startup safety reviews\n\n    Compliance audits\n\n    Incident investigation\n\n    Employee participation\n\n    Hot work permit\n\n    Contractors\n\n    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps: \n\n\n\n1. A prevention effort specific to this facility is a triple redundancy polymerization safety system (\"Poly Safety System\").  The Poly Safety System is designed to prevent runaway polymerization reactions by ensuring more energy is never placed into a reactor than can be safely contained.  \n\n\n\n2. The employees of the KRATON Plant are dedicated to continuous safety improvement. All chemicals are treated with equal respect when it comes to release prevention.  Ongoing training, procedure review, auditing, and process improvements support progress toward our goal of an accident and injury-free workplace.\n\n\n\n3. The individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems have established for the way we do busin"

We have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  \n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nWe keep records for all accidental chemical releases that occur at the facility.  Kraton has had one event occur in the past 5 years with respect to the listed chemicals.  On August 13, 2018, a release of 1,645 pounds of Isoprene occurred due to a fire in the Tank Farm when a pump ignited into flames. The release affected the ambient air over the Ohio River, however, no injuries resulted from the incident. There was no impact to the surrounding community or the waterways.  \n\n\n\nAll significant accidental releases of chemicals are formally investigated to identify and correct the root cause of the events.  Less significant events are also investigated so that we can learn from them and prevent future incidents.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n\n\nWe maintain an Emergency Response Plan, a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan, a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, a Hazardous Waste Contingency Plan, and a Facility Response Plan to assure appropriate emergency response.  Our programs provide the facilities, planning, and training and have been developed to assure protection of workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  We conduct periodic drills and critiques of events in order to continuously improve our response capability.  Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan and are represented on the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n\n\nThis facility is dedicated to continuous safety improvement.  Changes to improve safety and environmental performance occur regularly. The following is a partial listing of some of the activities the facility uses to identify opportunities for improvement in order to continuously improve process safety and prevent and/or better respond to accidental"
