      "SummaryText": "BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFLEXIBLE FOAM PRODUCTS, INC.\n501 INDUSTRIAL BLVD.\nTERRELL, TEXAS 75160\n\nFlexible Foam, Inc. owns and operates a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility on 501 Industrial Boulvard.  Flexible Foam receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  \n\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA\u0012s Risk Management Rule.\n\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the 501 Industrial Boulvard facility in tank trucks.  The trucks are off-loaded to a storage tank located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building,  the probability of release of toluene diisocyante vapors into the atmosphere is reduced.  As a result, the impact of such a release on the surrounding community is minimized.  There are no receptors (buildings and people other than the Flexible facility) that would be impacted by the release of stored toluene diisocyanate.\n\nBecause there are no public receptors and there have been no significant incidents of release in the last five years, Flexible Foam, 501 Industrial Boulvard facility is classified as a Program 1 facility.\n\n\n WORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n\nChemical:\nTOLUENE DIISOCYANATE\n\nAssumptions:\n\n*\tInstantaneous failure of the tank wall\n\n*\tWorst-case weather conditions (stable, low wind speed)\n\n*\tInstantaneous release of entire contents of tank ( 16030 gallons. )\n\nDistance:\t14 yards (42 feet)\n\nDescriptions:\n\nThis release scenario has a toxic level of concern end point that is on Flexible Foam\u0012s property.  Based on computer modeling (using an EPA-approved model) of a catastrophic release of TDI as described above, it would not impact any person standing or driving outside the boundary of the Flexible\u0012s prop"

      "SummaryText": "erty.  Any person visiting or working at Flexible would be advised of the proper response action through the company\u0012s emergency response procedures.\n\n\nSECTION 2.  TOXICS:  WORST CASE  EXPLANATION\n\nSection 2.6 release rate:\n\nFlexible Foam modeled with Aloha 5.2,  the release rate calculated was 0.00131 pounds per minute. Since EPA's RMP submit program does not accept any value less than 0.2, a factor of 0.2 was entered besause that is the lowest number that the RMP program would accept.  Based on the modeled release rate Flexible Foam is a Program 1 facility, independent of the value entered into RMP Submit.\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\nFlexible Foam, Inc. takes safety very seriously.  We use safety equipment and strict procedures to prevent releases and to reduce the impact of any release that might occur.  Some examples are:\n\n\t-Regular equipment inspections and maintenance to ensure proper operation.\n\t-Investigation of all incidents to improve our procedures.\n\t-Secondary containment to ensure that the contents of hazardous material remain on site.\n\t-Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials, Emergency Contingency Planning.\n\t-Hazardous Materials Awareness Training\n\t-Hazardous Materials Response Training\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\n\nFlexible personnel are regularly trained and drilled on safety and accident prevention.  \nThe following agencies are in place to respond to a release of hazardous material.\n\n\t-Terrell City Fire Department \n\t-TNRCC Emergency Response Team\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nNo significant accidents or releases in past five years."
