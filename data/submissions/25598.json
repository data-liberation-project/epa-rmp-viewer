LEPC, and request that they\nrespond to our emergency.\n\nFacility desciption and regulated substance handled:\n This facility is an NH3 plant. We sell and apply Anhydrous Ammonia as farm fertilizer. Our NH3 \nplant consists of one storage tank (18,000 gal.) and associated piping, compressor pump, valves,\nvents, nurse tanks and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nWorst Case release scenario:\n Our worst case scenario is a sudden failure of the storage tank when filled to maximum allowed\n(SOP 85% full), resulting in a toxic gas cloud. According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the \nendpoint is 3.3 miles. Within that distance to the endpoint are private residences, schools, recreation\nareas, and some small businesses, including farms. Population within the endpoint is 1,195 .\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n A more likely scenario would be a transfer hose failure, resulting in a small toxic gas cloud.\nAccording to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.5 mile.\nWithin that distance are private residences, a school, recreation areas, and some small businesses,\nincluding farms. Population within the endpoint is 161.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n This facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule, as well as all applicable local and\nstate codes and regulations. This Anhydrous Ammonia plant is designed, built and maintained according\nto OSHA (29 CFR 1910.111) and state regulations.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n No accidents involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, evacuations, environmental or property damage.\n\nPlanned changes to improve Safety : None at thi"
