This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes.  The Energy Transfer policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer operates the Cargray Gas Plant located in Cargray County, Texas. The Cargray Gas Plant is a cryogenic natural gas processing plant designed for the extraction of liquid Y-grade product from a gas stream. The cryogenic extraction plant recovers methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane from the inlet gas.  As evidenced in the ensuing text and based on criteria outlined in the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARP), the Cargray Plant is a Program 1 process.\r\n\r\nThe Cargray Gas Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances were present in the process and if they exceeded the threshold quantity. All equipment and vessels are considered to be connected and/or co-located; consequently, for the purposes of the ARP Program, all equipment and vessels are part of a single process. The identification of even a single vessel exceeding threshold quantities of a regulated flammable or toxic substance would subject a process to threshold determination for offsite consequence analysis.\r\n\r\nIt was determined that a single vessel of flammable mixture e"
