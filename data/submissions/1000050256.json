The Emergency Response brigade is comprised of both Chemours and DuPont employees and are specially trained operators that can respond in the event of an onsite chemical release. The Emergency Response team is thoroughly trained, properly equipped and staffed 24 hours a day. \r\n\r\nChambers Works conducts practice drills with the local community and emergency response organizations.  These drills simulate potential accidental release and test emergency response plans.  Chambers Works also supports a siren system in the local community that would provide early warning for a potential release.  This system is coordinated with the Salem County Office of Emergency Response.\r\n\r\nIn addition to on-site activities, Chambers works maintains transportation emergency response capability, which allows the site to respond to chemical transportation incidents outside the Chambers Works site.\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no incidents in the past 5 years that meet the Risk Management Plan reporting criteria.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nAs part of our process hazards review procedures, all of our processes are thoroughly studied on a periodic basis to identify risk reduction opportunities.
