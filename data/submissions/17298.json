      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary\n\nOsram Sylvania Products Incorporated\n\nINTRODUCTION:  Osram Sylvania Products Incorporated (Osram) is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for Osram workers, the public and the environment.  As part of this commitment, Osram has established systems to help ensure safe operation of the processes at this facility.  Toward that end, Osram operates within a Quality Management System, certified under ISO 9002, and an Environmental Management System, certified under ISO 14001.  A non-Osram, independent party audits both systems two times per year.  Another system is a risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks at Osram and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR part 68, \"Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs\" (the RMP rule).  One of the requirements of the RMP rule is to submit a risk management plan (RMPlan) describing the risk management program at Osram.  This plan is intended to satisfy the RMPlan requirement of the RMP rule ('68.150 through '68.185) and to provide the public with a description of the risk management program at Osram.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES: Osram is committed to the safety of Osram workers and the public, and to the preservation of the environment, through the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances.

The etching process produces frosted lighting envelopes.  \n\nHydrofluoric Acid: HF acid at solution concentrations of 50 wt% or greater are regulated by the RMP rule.  Although only dilute (about 28 wt%) HF solutions are used in the etching process, HF acid at a solution concentration of 70 wt% is stored in a large tank at the Osram facility for use in the process.\nA maximum of 5,330 gallons of 70 wt% HF acid is stored in one 5,922 gallon tank located at the Osram site.  The weight of HF acid in 5,330 gallons of 70 wt% solution is just under 38,000 lb., which exceeds the RMP rule threshold quantity for HF acid in a process (1,000 lb.)  Because the HF acid storage process is not covered by requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's process safety management regulation and because the potential exists for offsite consequences resulting from an accidental release of HF acid, the process falls under the RMP Program 2 prevention program.\n\nAqua Ammonia: Aqueous Ammonia at solution concentrations of 20 wt% or greater are regulated by the RMP rule.  Although only dilute (about 12 wt%) Ammonia solutions are used in the etching process, Ammonia at a solution concentration of 30 wt% is stored in a large tank at the Osram facility for use in the process.\nA maximum of 12,000 gallons of 30 wt% Ammonia is stored in one 12,000 gallon tank located at the Osram site.

Aqueous HF acid and aqueous Ammonia are toxic substances.\n\nHF Acid: The worst-case release scenario is failure of the 5,922-gallon storage tank, releasing 54,200 lb. of aqueous HF acid (70 %wt).  A diked area and containment building confine the released aqueous HF acid, which evaporates, forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to the toxic endpoint concentration is 0.2 mile.  Several houses are located within this distance from the storage tank, with a total population of about 130 people; no environmental receptors are within this distance.\nThe alternate release scenario for aqueous hydrofluoric acid is pipe leak in the schedule 160 liquid line connecting the aqueous HF acid (70 wt%) storage tank to the process catch basin.  This scenario assumes that the solution is released for 10 minutes before workers detect the release and isolate the line.  The released acid forms a pool, with HF evaporating in the pool and forming a vapor cloud.  The maximum distance to toxic endpoint is 0.2 mile.  Several houses are located within this distance from the storage tank, with a total population of about 130 people; no environmental receptors are within this distance.\n\nAqua Ammonia: The worst-case release scenario is failure of the 12,000-gallon storage tank, releasing 89,700 lb. of aqueous ammonia (30 %wt).
