This RMP formalizes and documents these activities. Home Run Inn is committed to conducting its operations in a safe and responsible manner thereby reducing risks to human health and the environment. It is Home Run Inn?s policy to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations.\n\n\n\nThis RMP has identified potential hazards and has taken steps to design and maintain a safe facility in order to prevent releases, and minimize the consequences of accidental releases, which could occur. RMP addresses a potentially catastrophic chemical release that could result in immediate harm and acute health effects to offsite receptors (public and environmental). The RMP includes a Emergency Response Plan (ERP) that contains procedures that are designed to maximize the safety of all employees, contractors, and visitors in the event of an emergency and also guard against environmental consequences.\n\n\n\nAlthough ammonia is a listed toxic substance, it is also a ubiquitous material, which is used by the surrounding farmers for fertilizer. Pursuant to 40 CFR 68.125 Exemptions ? Ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers, is exempt from all provisions of this part (40 CFR 68).\n\n\n\nFacility Identification and Process Description\n\nThe Home Run Inn facility is located at 1300 Internationale Parkway, Woodridge, Illinois 60517. The  of the property is approximately seven (7) acres and the ammonia refrigeration system resides in one (1) building. \n\n\n\nThere are 101 employees that work at the plant.\n\n\n\nThe facility is primarily engaged in the business of producing frozen pizzas.

The largest vessel located inside the building (HTRP-1) may contain as much as 6600 pounds.   \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nRMP/PSM Prevention Program provides information and procedures to prevent or minimize an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. The following ammonia refrigeration process equipment is covered: piping, condensers, evaporators, compressors, etc. The next compliance audit of the RMP/PSM Program will occured in July, 2016 (three (3) years). The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) shall be updated and revalidated no later than August of 2022 (five (5) years pursuant to the 29 CFR 1910.119(e)(6). The elements of the RMP/PSM Prevention Program along with a brief description are listed below:\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation ? Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Employee Participation Program (EPP) that ensures employees and their representatives are consulted when conducting and developing process hazard analyses and other information required to be developed under the RMP/PSM regulation. In addition, the EPP ensures employees and their representatives have access to process hazard analyses and all other information required to be developed under RMP/PSM. Employees at Home Run Inn have assisted in developing the initial PHA for the ammonia refrigeration process and will participate in updating and revalidating the PHA every five (5) years.  In addition, employees have assisted in the development of other RMP/PSM documentation such as the development of operating and preventative maintenance procedures.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI) "

Home run Inn has developed a site-specific PHA Program which is a formal study designed to analyze the process and identify potential hazards. In addition, this program has been established to ensure PHAs are conducted in accordance with OSHA and EPA regulations and to ensure findings and recommendations of PHAs are properly documented. A What if/Checklist approach was taken. \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures ? Home run Inn has developed site-specific written operating procedures that provide detailed, clear instructions describing the steps that should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\nTraining ? Home run Inn has developed a site-specific Training Program that ensures employees operating the ammonia refrigeration process have the knowledge to safely operate all aspects of the process, are aware of the potential hazards of the process, and understand the potential causes of process problems. This Program identifies the duties that employees should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. \n\n\n\nContractors ? Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Contractor Safety Program. All Home Run Inn contractors will be screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system. The Program ensures that all contract employers? safety performance and programs are evaluated, a contract employee injury and illness log is maintained, information of potential hazards are communicated between Home Run Inn a"

Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Management of Change Program to ensure that all changes made to the ammonia refrigeration system are properly reviewed, documented, and communicated to employees, contractors, and management team. The MOC Procedure ensures that changes (except for replacement in kind) to the ammonia process, such as additions of new equipment or changes in operating, maintenance, or other procedures are documented and communicated. \n\n\n\nPre-startup Review (PSSR) ? Home run Inn has developed a site-specific Pre-startup Safety Review Program that is completed for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the process is started. A PSSR is performed when modifications to the ammonia process are significant enough to require a change in PSI.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity (MI) ? Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Mechanical Integrity Program that ensures written preventative maintenance procedures are developed and maintained, preventative maintenance tests and inspections are properly documented, and employees maintaining the process receive adequate training. The MI Program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration system is built, used, and maintained using preventive maintenance procedures to minimize unexpected breakdowns or failures.  \n\n\n\nIncident Investigation ? Home Run Inn has developed a site-specific Incident Investigation Program that ensures each incident that either results in a release or could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia is investigated within 48 hours. This Program ensures that any incidents are investigated, reviewed, and documented using an investigation team including at"
