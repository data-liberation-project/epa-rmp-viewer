This RMP is intended to work in synergy with the facility's Emergency Response Plan prepared for this area, and to maintain a liaison with the local emergency responders.\n\n\n\nThe Panola Gas Processing Facility (PGP) is located in Panola County, Texas, east of the town of Carthage.  The facility is located at the global position of 32.1838? N and -94.2563? W, WGD84 datum.  The facility is owned and operated by Enable Texola Gathering & Processing, LLC.\n\n\n\nThe plant processes natural gas from various oil and gas production facilities in the vicinity. The acid gas components (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) are removed from the gas using an amine unit.  The sweetened gas is then dried using a glycol dehydrator.  The gas is further dried in molecular sieve dehydrators. The dried gas is then routed to a cryogenic skid, in which the gas is expanded from higher pressure to lower pressure causing the natural gas liquids (NGL) to separate from the gas stream.  The refrigeration system contains propane stored in a 30,000 gallon pressurized steel tank.  NGLs are contained in a separate 28,843 gallon insulated, pressurized steel tank.  The components of NGL (ethane, propane, butane, iso-butane and pentane) are classified as regulated flammable substances and are present in the product in an amount greater than the threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  Less than 10,000 lbs of hydrogen sulfide is present in the inlet gas, and thus not included in this RMP review.\n\n\n\nThe PGP is qualified in the Level 3 Program for risk management.  The worst-case scenario for plant release is identified as a gas vapor cloud explosion (VCE), and is projected to reach offsite receptors with an endpoint"

Other alternate release scenario's include; Relief Valve failure, Pump Seal failure and or Piping and Valve component failures.\n\n\n\nThe processes at the plant are regulated by the EPA's Risk Management Program regulations as well as OSHA's PSM Standard.  The plant's Process Hazard Analysis team has conducted the \"HAZOP\" methods of process hazard review.  This RMP and the PSM program dove-tail to help ensure safe operations at the Panola Gas Processing Facility.\n\n\n\n"
