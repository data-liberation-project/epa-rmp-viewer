Management of the documents and approval to proceed are controlled at the department level.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nWVC promptly investigates all process safety related incidents.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to plant management.  Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. When necessary, short-term interim measures are taken until the permanent fix is implemented.  The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings. Incident investigation reports are retained on file for at least five years to supplement the hazard analysis records for the affected areas, and are reviewed during PHAs and PHA revalidations.  WVC implemented a non-conformance report database and an employee improvement program in November 2003.  \r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nTo help ensure that the process safety program is functioning properly, WVC periodically undergoes an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required are being implemented.  Compliance audits are conducted at least every three years.  The WVC Corporate HSE office conducted a PSM compliance audit in February 2011.  Both hourly and management personnel participate in the audits.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to the plant management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are resolved. The final resolution of each finding is documented. Additionally, OSHA is in the pro"

The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP-covered processes at the facility.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.  In addition to the accident prevention program activities, WVC has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. The following types of safety features are used where appropriate:\r\n\r\nRelease Detection\r\n\r\n--Hydrocarbon detectors with alarms\r\n\r\nRelease Containment/Control\r\n\r\n--Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\r\n--Scrubber to neutralize chemical releases\r\n--Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\r\n--Automated shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high level, high temperature)\r\n--Vessel to permit partial removal of the process inventory in the event of a release (e.g., dump tank)\r\n--Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\r\n--Redundant equipment and instrumentation (e.g., uninterruptible power supply for process control system, backup firewater pump)\r\n--Atmospheric relief devices\r\n\r\nRelease Mitigation\r\n\r\n--Fire suppression and extinguishing systems\r\n--Deluge systems for specific equipment\r\n--Trained emergency response personnel\r\n--Personal protective equipment (e.g., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\r\n\r\nFive-year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been two accidents which meet the criteria established under RMP that have occurred at WVC's Geismar facility during the past five years.

While our goal is to eliminate the occurrence of such events, WVC recognizes that they may occur and therefore we also work to ensure proper response to minimize and mitigate any potential impact on our employees and the neighboring community.  \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nWVC's Geismar facility maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  Emergency response program changes are administered such that informing and/or training affected personnel is accomplished prior to implementation of the change.\r\n\r\nThe overall emergency response program for the Geismar facility is coordinated with the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) network which is comprised of local industries and the Ascension Parish Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).

This refresher training will be conducted at least once every three years.  All training is documented for each operator, including, the means used to verify that the operator comprehended the training.\r\n\r\nContractors\r\nWVC routinely employs contractors to work on or near process equipment.  Additional contractor work force is present during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Contractors are provided both plant-wide and unit-specific training.   In addition, craftsmen must complete the eight-hour safety-training program for industrial workers provided by industry through the local safety council.  The training is maintained through annual refresher training.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the safety training, procedures are in place to ensure that contractors perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in the event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find.  Each contractor employee is provided with a process overview and information about safety and health hazards, emergency response plan requirements, and safe work practices prior to beginning work.

Employees have access to all information created as part of the plant accident prevention program.  Specific ways that employees are involved in the process safety management program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the plant and addresses each process safety program element. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nWVC has a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  Specific departments within the plant are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  Employees have been advised of the location of the process safety information and trained in how to use the information.\r\n\r\nChemical-specific information, including information on exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\r\n\r\nWVC has a comprehensive program to ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify potential process safety hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  The facility primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evalua"

The analyses are conducted by a team comprised of individuals who have operating, safety, environmental and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures.  Suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures are made when the team finds such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, WVC will update and revalidate the hazard analysis results at least once every five years for the life of the process. The results and findings from these updates will be documented and forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution documented and retained.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\n\r\nWVC maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) shutdown, and (4) initial startup of a new process.  Temporary and emergency operating procedures are developed for each case prior to commencement of the operation.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  Procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process.  Procedures are reviewed annually.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nWVC has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. New employees receive basic training in both safety issues and plant operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks.  After an operator demonstrates (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner, the operator can work independent"

      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nLDEQ Facility ID Number - 1138\r\n\r\nWestlake Vinyls Company, LP (WVC)acquired a chemical manufacturing facility formerly owned and operated by Borden Chemicals and Plastics Operating Limited Partnership (BCP) in Geismar, Louisiana.  BCP had operated the facility until April 2002 when all process units were shutdown.  De-inventory of all chemicals was completed by September 2002.  In December 2002, WVC acquired a portion of the facility from BCP.   As required by 40 CFR 68.155, WVC is including with the Risk Management Plan Submission the following Executive Summary.                                                                                           \r\n\r\nWVC  has conducted EDC production operations since November 2003 and PVC and VCME production operations since December 2004.  WVC performed all appropriate equipment testing, HAZOPs, Pre start-up Safety Reviews (PSSR's), and all other startup procedures prior to startup of operations.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWVC has a commitment to protection of the health and safety of its employees and the general public. It is WVC policy to provide the safest workplace possible for our employees while also minimizing to the fullest extent practical any impact on the neighboring community, which includes striving to eliminate accidental releases.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes; providing proper training to personnel; having up-to-date operating procedures; and implementing an effective maintenance and mechanical integrity program.  Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to minimize the potential for releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release in order to minimize to the fullest extent any po"
