      "SummaryText": "The High Falls Brewing Company (HFBCo) produces beer and ale products.  HFBCo uses anhydrous ammonia in its refrigeration system to provide space cooling, and to chill water, beer, and glycol.  The amount of ammonia in the entire refrigeration system is estimated to be 27,000 lbs.\n\nBecause GBCo stores more than 10,000 lbs of ammonia in its refrigeration system, it is covered by the EPA regulation 40 CFR Part 68 - Accidental Release Prevention Requirements: Risk Management Programs, and the OSHA regulation 29 CFR 1910.119 - Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.  The EPA program will be hereafter identified as RMP, and the OSHA program will hereafter be identified as PSM.\n\nThe RMP focuses more on impacts to the environment and public receptors, while the PSM program focuses more on worker safety.  However, the primary goal of both programs is to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of hazardous chemicals.  HFBCo is already in compliance with the PSM program, which requires action items like mechanical integrity inspections, preventative maintenance, and employee training - all of which help to prevent accidental ammonia releases.  Many requirements in the PSM program are identical to those listed in the RMP program. \n\nEvery five years, HFBCo is required to critically examine each piece of equipment that contains ammonia, and determine scenarios for potential failure and/or release.  When the potential for a serious failure/release is identified, corrective actions are developed to minimize or eliminate the hazard.  HFBCo has recently concluded this review, and is in the process of implementing those corrective actions.  This demonstrates HFBCo's commitment to continuous safety improvement of our refrigeration system.\n\nHFBCo is committed to safety, and is a responsible member of the Rochester community.  In addition to complying with the PSM and RMP regulations, HFBCo also has a facility Emergency Action Plan, and Contingency"

      "SummaryText": " Plans for responding to releases of other chemicals, petroleum, and hazardous wastes.  We have a full time Security Department which is trained to respond to emergencies, and we also have an on-site Emergency Action Team.  HFBCo has established good working relationships with local emergency response authorities and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.  If a significant off-site release of anhydrous ammonia were to occur, HFBCo believes it is well prepared to quickly, safely and effectively respond to the incident, and to interface and coordinate response activities with local emergency officials.\n\nAlthough minor ammonia leaks and releases do occasionally occur in any large and complex refrigeration system, HFBCo has never experienced an anhydrous ammonia release which adversely impacted off-site public and environmental receptors such as commercial and private businesses, industries, schools, public buildings, national or state parks, wild life sanctuaries, or designated federal wilderness areas."
