No additional measures are necessary to prevent offsite impacts from accidental releases.  In the event of fire, explosion or a release of a regulated substance from the process(es), entry within the distance to the specified endpoints may pose a danger to public emergency responders.

One incident involving a release less than the RQ of 100 lbs of TDI occurred in the 4th quarter of 2021 and is detailed below.\n\nThe Employer, Bridgestone APM at the time, now Archem America, Inc. makes foam seats for vehicles, which involves a process reacting the components polyurethane and TDI in molds, known as \u0093tools.\u0094 The \u0093demold\u0094 point is when the formed foam seat and the mold \u0093tool\u0094 are separated after the curing oven where the foam is formed. The Incident occurred during the overnight shift of November 15, 2021, to November 16, 2021. An equipment malfunction occurred in the pouring area, which resulted in a sticky, pancake-like substance in the \u0093tools\u0094 (i.e., seat molds), which did not cure and needed to be cleaned out to continue production. The supervisor, against Company protocol, told the employees to begin the process of cleaning the \u0093tools\u0094 using gloves and scrapers. After a short period of time, two employees did not feel well and went outside for fresh air.  The area was immediately cleared of all production employees and only Respondent\u0092s HAZMAT team was in the area to clean the \u0093tools.\u0094 After investigation, it was ultimately determined that the mixture had the correct amount of toluene 2,4 diisocyanate (TDI), but not enough polyurethane in it.\n\nThis was not a release to any environmental media.  The pouring malfunction was contained in the tool, and the total release was less than 100 lbs.\n\nIn the event that a significant spill does occur, we will conduct a formal incident investigation to identify and correct the root causes of each event.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.

The ALOHA model predicted the toxic end point for a catastrophic tote failure that does not go past the Bridgestone APM Plant property perimeter.\n\n\nThe release rate calculated by the ALOHA program was a value of 0.00293 lbs/min.  This release rate rounded to 0.16 lb/min in order to have a release rate that would not be printed as zero by RMP*eSubmit.  The evaporation duration calculated by ALOHA was 60 minutes.  The evaporation duration time was entered as 60 minutes as allowed by RMP*eSubmit.  The toxic endpoint calculated by ALOHA&reg; was determined to be 0.1 miles and was entered in RMP*eSubmit as 0.01 miles.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nWe maintain a number of programs to help prevent accidental releases and ensure safe operation.  The accident prevention programs in place include:\n\n1.\tTDI is received in stainless steel totes\n2.\tEmployees (Material Handlers) that handle the unloading of TDI receive training on truck unloading and storage\n3.\tInternal checklists are used for every unloading event to help reduce the risk of an accidental release.\n4.\tMaterial Handlers are trained in forklift operation for the lifting of totes, transport and placement of the TDI in the chemical storage room.\n5.\tThe chemical room has a 5.5 inch dike for secondary containment.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe will keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.\n\nThe following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nArchem America Inc. has"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario(s) Evaluation - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe following is a summary of the worst-case scenario developed for the Sanborn facility RMP.  The tote volume used was 350 gallons.\n\nA tote rupture was assumed to be the worst-case scenario which would release the tote contents into the chemical storage room secondary containment area surrounding the tote.  The total area of the secondary containment measures 550 square feet with a depth of 5.5 inches. The liquid TDI would be contained in the secondary containment area.  The amount of TDI that would be emitted is equal to the volume of TDI in a single tote in the secondary containment surface area. The worst-case release scenario assumed that the surface area emissions of the contained TDI would first be released into the enclosed chemical room area before being released to the surrounding area.\n\nOur Worst-case Release Scenario would be a catastrophic failure of a single 350 gallon tote.  This would involve the involuntary release of up to 350 gallons of TDI to the diked area located inside the chemical room of the facility.\n\nThe RMP regulations require determining if the toxic endpoint for the worst-case release scenario remains within the facility property boundary or if it goes offsite and possibly impacts public receptors.  The toxic endpoint for TDI listed in 40 CFR 68 Appendix A - Table Of Toxic Endpoints is 0.007 milligrams per Liter (mg/L) (1 ppm).  This airborne concentration is the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals can be exposed"
