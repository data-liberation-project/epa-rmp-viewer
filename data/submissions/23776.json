If an emergency were to\noccur, it is our policy to notify the Marion Fire Dept. and the Linn Co. LEPC, and request that they\nrespond to our emergency.\n\nFacility description and regulated substance handled:\n  This facility is a farm fertilizer plant.  We sell and apply dry and liquid fertilizer.  Our Anhydrous Ammonia\nplant consists of two storage tanks (26,000 and 12,000 gal.) and associated piping, compressor pump,\nvalves, vents, nurse tanks, and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nWorst Case release scenario:\n  Our worst case scenario is a sudden failure of both storage tanks when filled to maximum allowed\n(SOP 85% full) , resulting in a toxic gas cloud.  According to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the\nendpoint is 4.4 miles.  Within the distance to the endpoint are private residences,  schools, recreation\nareas, numerous businesses and industries, and a wildlife sanctuary.  Population within the endpoint\nis 30,743.\n\nAlternative release scenario:\n  A more likely scenario would be a transfer hose failure, resulting in a small toxic gas cloud.\nAccording to EPA look-up tables, the distance to the endpoint is 0.5 mile.\nWithin that distance are private residences, recreation areas, and an industrial area with offices.\nPopulation within the endpoint is 644.\n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps:\n  This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule as well as all applicable local and state codes\nand regulations.  This Anhydrous Ammonia plant is designed, built and maintained according to OSHA\n(29 CFR 1910.111) and state regulations.\n\nFive-year accident history:\n  No accidents involving NH3 that caused death, injuries, environmental or property damage, or evacuations.\n\nEmergency Respo"
