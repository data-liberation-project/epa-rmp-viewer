The Plan includes an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, and a release prevention and emergency response program.  \r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis has implemented release prevention and emergency response procedures to minimize the potential for accidental releases of hazardous materials.  Emergency response procedures including evacuation procedures and notification procedures have been implemented by Wilbur-Ellis.  In addition, Wilbur-Ellis has developed operating procedures and preventative maintenance activities to reduce the likelihood of accidental releases.\r\n\r\nThis Plan and the emergency response procedures document the accidental release prevention, safety, and emergency policies in place at Wilbur-Ellis.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis is located at 505 3rd Street in Chester, South Dakota (the facility).  Wilbur-Ellis is a retailer of fertilizer in the form of anhydrous ammonia stored under pressure.  There is one anhydrous ammonia storage tank located at the facility with a capacity of approximately 18,000 gallons.  The anhydrous ammonia tank is routinely filled to 85% capacity.  The anhydrous ammonia is transferred from the storage tanks into 1,000-gallon and 1,450-gallon nurse tanks.  A maximum total of 24 nurse tanks containing anhydrous ammonia are stored at the facility at any given time.  The contents of the nurse tanks are sold to the local farming community for use as fertilizer.  \r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n  \r\nWilbur-Ellis has developed and implemented this Plan with the objective of complying wit"

The Plan's purpose is to enhance the facility's existing safety programs implemented at the site to reduce the possibility of accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia that could cause harm to employees, the public and the environment.  The emergency response program, documented in the emergency response procedures, includes accidental release prevention and chemical specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nWilbur-Ellis ensures that equipment meets the appropriate industry standards prior to use.  Wilbur-Ellis implements operating procedures and maintenance procedures in accordance with manufacturer and industry specifications to prevent accidental releases at the facility.  Chemical specific prevention steps implemented at the site include excess flow valves, pressure relief valves, emergency shut off valves with cables that run along the length of the horizontal storage tanks for quick access, and ammonia training for personnel.\r\n \r\nFive-Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere has been one accidental anhydrous ammonia release at the facility within the five-year period prior to this plan.  On 14 April 2014, a Wilbur-Ellis employee was injured while preparing an anhydrous ammonia tool bar and nurse tank.  The hose and quick coupler to the tool bar had become loose and approximately one pound of pressurized anhydrous ammonia was released into the eyes of the Wilbur-Ellis employee.  An incident investigation was conducted following the accident and changes at the facility were implemented based on the findings of the investigation.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe facility coordinates with the Chester Fire Department (fire department) regarding specific actions to be taken in response to an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.

Incorporate and implement non-destructive thickness testing into the RMP Maintenance Program consistent with RAGAGEP.\r\n2. Paint all nurse tank PVs that have peeling paint and show signs of rusting.\r\n3. Install rain cap on HRV 18 & 36.\r\n4. Install rain cap on nurse tank PV 23 HRV and inspect all nurse tank PVs for missing HRV or PRV rain caps and install rain caps.\r\n5. Inspect all nurse tanks for expired or soon to be expired PRVs and replace them. \r\n6. Replace Armstrong Class A/CA Series Y-Strainers 16 and 55 with Y-strainer constructed of steel, ductile iron, or malleable iron and that has a pressure rating (MAWP) of 400 psig.\r\n7.
