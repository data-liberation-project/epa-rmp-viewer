All Flexitank employees are informed of hazards in the workplace, are trained accordingly and have procedures in place on the facility in the unlikely event that hazardous substance releases were to occur, which activates emergency notification and response procedures to ensure the safety of our employees, the community, the environment and property. \n\n\n\n2. Facility and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nFlexitank is an NVOCC (OTI) that specializes in logistics management. We occasionally store ISO-tanks containing chemical products for our customers as an \"added value\" service in our Depot Facilities located on the Zona Portuaria in San Juan. \n\n\n\nFlexitank Depot receives the bulk liquid cargo by the following modes of transportation: tank trucks, ISO tank containers and flexi-bags (no hazardous products only). The received cargo is stored on-site according to customer-specified requirements, and it is subsequently dispatch on the same transportation modes as originally received. Flexitank, Inc. does not perform any chemical processing, manufacturing or product transfer to intermediate storage containers. \n\n\n\nThe following Regulated Toxic Substances are occasionally stored at Flexitank, Depot facilities and have been identified by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release: \n\n\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia (CAS Number 7664"

Prevention Program\n\n\n\nActions to prevent the recurrence or spread of fires, explosions or releases include stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing released material, and recovering or isolating containers. In addition, if the facility stops operations in response to an emergency, the Emergency Coordinator will monitor valves, pipes and other equipment for leaks, pressure build up, gas generation or ruptures.\n\n\n\nThe information contained in this program has been prepared in accordance with the requirements for a Prevention, Preparedness and Contingency Plan as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 265.50 through 265.56, as well as any applicable Commonwealth of Puerto Rico laws, rules and regulations. Also, elements of Emergency Response Plans (in accordance to EPCRA requirements), and of Risk Management Plans (40 CFR 63) have been incorporated to minimize hazards to human health or the environment resulting from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials or any of its constituents to the air, soil or surface water.\n\n\n\nThe hazardous materials storage facilities are inspected on a weekly basis. The inspection forms include a written checklist to be followed during the inspection. The facilities are inspected for signs posted, safety features, liquid level, tank or container identification, ruptures, corrosion, leaks, conditions of vents, integrity of dikes, materials inside dikes and other. Any deficiency is immediately reported and corrective action taken as soon as possible. Records are maintained until the next internal inspection is conducted or five years, whichever i"

Records of these inspections are kept for at least three years.\n\n\n\nPrior to any company employee being assigned to handling hazardous materials, he or she must be instructed by qualified resources, on the hazards of the material, safety and health precautions, and the use and requirements for protective clothing and equipment, including respirators. Any operational personnel that will be involved in any way in the response to an incident involving hazardous materials, waste or substances must receive the appropriate training.\n\n\n\nThe following trainings are taken by the appropriate personnel:\n\n\n\n?    24 hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (First Responder Operations Level Course) - Personnel that will help in the control of the incident but that will not apply defensive measures to control the spill.\n\n?    40 hour Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (Hazardous Materials Technician Course) - Personnel that will actually become in contact with the spilled material and that will employ defensive strategies in order to stop the release.

General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Ammonia Specific Prevention\n\n\n\nFlexitank, Inc. has programs to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the ammonia ISO-tanks. ISO-tanks are considered portable tanks; they are designed and constructed by IMO and 49 CFR 172.101 \"T\", codes and industry standards. Regulatory inspections of these tanks are performed accordingly, and a \"pre-trip\" preventive maintenance program is in place to ensure ongoing system integrity and to minimize release incidents. All employees associated with this facility operation have been trained and are knowledgeable in the safe operation of ISO tanks and emergency response procedures in case of a release. \n\n\n\n5. Five Year Accident History\n\n\n\nDuring the past five (5) years, there have been no accidental releases from RMP covered processes at the Flexitank Depot or off site which resulted in death, injuries, or significant property or environmental damages.\n\n\n\nAll incidents and releases, on site or off site, are formally investigated as part of our facility's QHSSE program to identify corrective and preventive actions for continuous process improvement.\n\n\n\n6.
