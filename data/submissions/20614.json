This site has an employee population of 192 with a staff of four full-time health, environmental and safety professionals to coordinate efforts in those areas.  A fifth employee devotes half his time to health, environmental and safety matters.\n\nDetailed programs are in place to address the needs of process safety, employee safety, employee health, environmental protection, facility and equipment loss and downtime and much more.  Key to the process safety efforts, covering both OSHA and EPA requirements and more, is our formal four part pre-startup review of any new process.  This program consists of:\n\n1. Development of a Custom Chemical Checklist (CCC) which consists of a documented detailed review of the hazards and any applicable regulatory requirements; \n2. Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), usually consisting of a Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study by a multi-disciplinary team of employees; \n3. Thorough training programs for all operators and maintenance personnel on the operation of the process, it's hazards and methods of minimizing the potential for upset conditions;\n4. Pre-Startup inspections to be sure all is in order before any chemicals are introduced to the process.\n\nDuring this process, efforts are made to minimize inventory requirements, minimize waste generated, maximize product conversion efficiency and enhance employee and environmental safety.

No flammable or combustible materials are stored or located near the cylinders.  The evaporator buildings are constructed of steel, are thermally insulated and are kept closed during chlorine usage.  The two storage areas and evaporator buildings are protected from large vehicle collisions by concrete-filled metal posts.  Only DOT-approved steel cylinders are used.  The cylinders are leak-tested and inspected by the supplier before they are filled.  Respirators are worn by employees while connecting or disconnecting cylinders to and from the evaporators.  Chlorine cylinder patching and repair kits are readily available near all chlorine processes.  Employee members of CDC's emergency response team are trained on the use of the kits.  Self-contained breathing apparatus is readily available for emergency use by employees responding to a chlorine leak.  Chlorine detectors in the evaporator buildings and the chemical production buildings sound audible alarms in the event of chlorine leaks.  The detectors also automatically close automatic control valves on the evaporators.  The steel lines connecting the evaporators with the chemical production buildings are welded to prevent leaks.  Caustic scrubbers remove any chlorine that vents from the process.\n\nA number of precautions and safety measures are employed to prevent occurrence of any phosphorous oxychloride releases. The phosphorous oxychloride drums are banded together three to a pallet so they cannot tip over.

The site chemical production buildings are manned around the clock.\n\n5-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no chlorine or phosphorous oxychloride releases over the last 5 years that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on site, or offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.   \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nCDC is located on the border of two municipalities (Fitchburg and Westminster) and as such believes we have a responsibility to both to ensure their safety from upset conditions should they occur at our operations.  We work closely with the two fire departments both for training as well as drilling purposes.  Both fire departments have detailed and comprehensive emergency notification systems and our internal emergency response plan clearly outlines our means of communicating with these organizations.   Numerous fire pull stations throughout the site automatically alert both fire departments of any emergency.  Numerous portable dry chemical fire extinguishers throughout the site are available for the immediate use of all employees, who are annually provided hands-on fire extinguisher training.  An on-site employee emergency response team is trained and equipped to handle most spills or releases.  It consists of 79 hazardous material technicians, 9 emergency medical technicians and 9 confined space rescue technicians.

All site supervisors and operators are equipped with portable radios.  A site public address system allows instant communication with most site employees.  A number of site managers, including safety and environmental, are always on-call when off-duty by means of cellular phone and beepers.\n\nIn the event of a significant chlorine or phosphorous oxychloride  release, our emergency response plan requires that the fire departments be immediately notified of the release, along with the wind speed and direction as indicated on our on-site weather instruments.  While the fire departments notify potentially effected downwind residents, businesses and schools, our employee will be instructed by means of our on-site gas release siren and public address system to shelter-in-place in their buildings.  The gas release siren is also audible to most neighbors within a half-mile of the site.  They have been advised by means of a letter and an on-site Safety Fair held on August 21, 1999 what the siren means and how they should respond if they hear it.  The siren is tested monthly.  Our on-site emergency response team is trained to respond to the source of the leak in adequate personal protective equipment and contain it.\n\nSheltering-in-place is a proven way of protecting personnel in the path of a gas release.  Efficiency of protection is based on how well air is prevented from entering the place of shelter.  Sheltering-in-place is accomplished by doing the following as soon as learning of a gas release:\n\n* going inside the nearest building\n* turning off air conditioning and heating\n* closing all windows and doors\n* extinguishing any fire in the fireplace and closing the chimney flue\n* if in a vehicle, turning off the air conditioning and outside air and closing windows\n* tuning the radio to a local emergency broadcast station: WEIM 125"
