This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating LLC. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\n The Morgan's Point Complex located in Harris County, Texas is owned by Enterprise Products Operating, L L C. and is operated by Enterprise.  \n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex is a hydrocarbon storage and terminal facility capable of receiving, storing and shipping flammable hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon mixtures.  The facility currently handles a flammable isobutane product, a flammable isobutylene product, a flammable ethane product, a flammable ethylene product and a flammable natural gasoline product.  Liquids are primarily received at the facility via pipeline and barge or tanker truck delivery.  Received liquids are stored in above ground storage tanks pending sale or shipment.  Liquids are shipped out of the terminal via pipeline, barge, ship, or tanker trucks.  \n\nFor the Ethane Export Facility dehydration is carried out in solid desiccant dehydrators to remove trace amounts water from the ethane products so that this water will not freeze when the product is refrigerated prior to loading. The dehydrators use vaporized ethane for regeneration.  The dehydrators have pre and post-filtering of the ethane product being loaded. Following dehydration, the ethane is refrige"

The facility will utilize a mixed refrigerant process to chill 255,000 lb/hr of polymer grade ethylene from pipeline temperature to - 154?F.\n\nThe facility includes a 30,000 metric ton refrigerated ethylene storage tank and ancillary equipment. Vendor supplied in-tank ship loading pumps are designed for a 1,000 metric ton per hour ship loading rate. Also included in the project scope is a new loading arm and loading arm drain tank at both Wharf 7 and Wharf 8. The facility is designed to allow for ship loading prior to commissioning the atmospheric storage tank, and therefore includes an ethylene loading drum and associated pumps.\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on operating knowledge.  Listed flammable substances which are stored above the threshold quantities at the Morgan's Point Complex are a flammable isobutane product, a flammable ethane product and propylene which is used as a refrigerant in the ethane export terminal.  Natural gasoline is also received and stored at the facility, but is exempt from the RMP regulation. Isobutane storage at the facility is classified as storage incident to transportation and not subject to the RMP regulation.  Isobutylene passes through the facility in a DOT jurisdictional pipeline but is not present in threshold quantities.  \n\nThe storage and terminal operations are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard and are classified as a Program Level 3 site under the EPA RMP program.  \n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\n\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will no"

The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes recommendations for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.  \n\n\n\nAs part of Enterprise Process Hazard Analysis program, the plant will periodically update and revalidate the hazard analysis results.  \n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and "

All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.  In addition, Enterprise evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the contractor selection process.  Enterprise personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\n\n\nThe Morgan's Point Complex conducts a PSSR prior to the startup of all new facilities or any modification that requires a change in process safety information.
