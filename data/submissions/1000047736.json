Monitoring systems, operating procedures, engineering controls and safe work practices were developed, updated and implemented in order to protect employees, the community and the environment from the consequences of an accidental release of product or failure of vessels or components.  Ammonia detectors with automatic shutdown systems have been installed along with pull down alarms at all Engine Room entrances.  In addition, visual alarms, hourly/daily inspections, extensive training, maintenance and safe work procedures have been implemented/installed to maintain the safe operation of this process.  ",

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                     Ambassador Services, Inc.in Cape Canaveral, FL is committed to protecting its employees, the surrounding community and the environment from an accidental release of the anhydrous ammonia used in the refrigeration system.  The release prevention program addresses such issues as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and training to ensure that releases do not occur.  Frequent inspections, regular maintenance, process monitors, rigorous supervised on-the-job training and 24 hour surveillance of the process reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  If a release does occur, however, employees are trained to contain the spill from a safe distance and implement notification procedures.  Emergency shutdown will be automatic with a new monitoring/detection system and emergency pull down alarms are installed at the entrance to all engine rooms.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Cape Canaveral Fire and Rescue Services located within minutes of the facility. \n\n\n\n2.  Regulated Substance\n\nThe facility is a cold and dry storage warehouse and anhydrous ammonia is used as cooling material in a closed system.  There is approximately 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the system and it is the only regulated substance at the site that exceeds the threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of product and the location of public receptors, the facility is covered as a Level 3 facility under RMP regulations and is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThis facility has developed all prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accident Release requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA's Process Safety Management (P"

Drawings and written information specific to the process is maintained on site.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses - A PHA was conducted, deficiencies identified and corrections scheduled and/or implemented.  All PHAs are reviewed before re-submission and were reviewed and updated this year (November, 2014)\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures - SOPs, SMPs, PMPs were developed and implemented for all activities relating to the process and prepared in accordance with OSHA and EPA guidelines.  They are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to remain consistent with the process.\n\n\n\nTraining - Employees initially undergo an extensive 6-month apprenticeship with specific training, both classroom and on the job, in all phases of the process.  Refresher training is provided every 3 years or more frequently if necessary.  All process employees are trained to HazWoper Technician Level emergency response.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity - An extensive maintenance program for all components has been implemented.  Thorough inspections, (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) are performed and deviations or deficiencies corrected immediately.  Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMPs) and Preventative Maintenance Procedures (PMPs) have been written for all maintenance and inspection activities and are reviewed annually to ensure that they are current.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change - There is a written management of change procedure in place, however, during the past five years, work performed on the system was \"replacement in kind\".\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews - Are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system or its components are opened for repairs, tie-ins or modifications.

The program is designed to identify root causes and indicate preventative measures to prevent a re-occurrence.  The reports will be maintained on file for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation - Every employee involved in the process has participated in all phases of the establishment of the Risk Management Program.  Each is dedicated to the prevention of product releases and subsequent potential injuries to themselves, their coworkers, the surrounding community and the environment.\n\n\n\nContractors - A procedure for reviewing the safety performance and past safety history of any contractor hired to work on or with the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has been developed and will be followed.  The policy includes an obligation to inform the contractor of the hazards they and their workers will be exposed to as well as emergency response procedures.  A performance evaluation system to ensure that the Contractor adheres to the company safety and health policies is contained within the procedures.\n\n\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History - an ammonia release of approximately 15 gallons (75 lbs) occurred March 19, 2014. Emergency procedures were initiated and the product contained with the assistance of the Fire department.   The investigation indicated a 1/2\" nipple had broken.  The defective part was repaired and  similar connectors welded to prevent a similar occurrence.  The release was less than the 100 lbs and did not result in a death, injury, significant property damage and did migrate off site, it is, therefore, not required to be listed in the 5 year Accident history.\n\n\n\n5."

The plan has been coordinated carefully with the Cape Canaveral Fire and Rescue.\n\n\n\n6.
