Each accumulator is equipped with an expansion valve which expands the high pressure liquid into a low temperature and pressure liquid as it enters the vessel. The flooded accumulators supply, by gravity, low pressure liquid to the associated evaporators. Liquid and vapor returned from the evaporators is separated inside the flooded accumulators to allow only the vapor to be returned to the main suction accumulator. Under normal conditions, the flooded accumulators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nAir-Cooling Evaporators (Flooded)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the air-cooling evaporators is to remove heat from the air in order to maintain a predetermined space temperature. The air-cooling evaporators receive liquid from the flooded accumulator. The evaporators contain a set of continuous coils through which the low pressure liquid flows. Due to the low pressures and temperatures maintained in the evaporator, the liquid refrigerant absorbs a great deal of heat from the surrounding area and evaporates. To increase the rate of heat removed, the evaporators use an electric fan to move warm air over the coils of cold liquid ammonia. Once the liquid has evaporated to form low temperature and pressure vapor, it returns to the supplying vessel. Under normal conditions, the air-cooling evaporators contain low pressure liquid and vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nMain Suction Accumulator\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the main suction accumulator is to prevent liquid from entering the compressors. The main suction accumulator receives vapor from the flooded accumulators and separates any residual liquid from the vapor to allow only the vapor to be piped to the suction of each compressor. Liquid in the main suction accumulator drains by gravity to the liquid transfer pump. The main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float swit"

Under normal conditions, the main suction accumulator contains low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nLiquid Transfer Pump\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the liquid transfer pump is to transfer liquid from the low side of the refrigeration system back to the high pressure receiver. The liquid transfer pump receives liquid from the main suction accumulator. Once the liquid level in the main suction accumulator reaches the float switch, the liquid transfer ammonia pump is activated for a period of time which moves the liquid to the high pressure receiver. Under normal conditions the liquid transfer pump contains low pressure liquid.\r\n\r\nCompressors\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the compressors is to raise the temperature and pressure of the low pressure gas in order to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporator to the atmosphere. The compressors receive low pressure vapor from the main suction accumulator and discharge high pressure vapor to the evaporative condensers. The compressors are equipped with high discharge pressure cutouts to shut the equipment off if the pressure exceeds the setpoint. Under normal conditions, the compressors contain both high and low pressure vapor ammonia.\r\n\r\nEvaporative Condensers\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the evaporative condensers is to reject the heat absorbed in the evaporators to the atmosphere. The evaporative condensers receive high pressure, superheated vapor from the compressors and supply high pressure liquid to the high pressure receiver. The condensers use air and water to cool the warm ammonia as it passes through a series of tubes within the condenser. As the cooling medium of air and water draws the heat from the vapor, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid and flows to the high pressure receiver.

      "SummaryText": "w Suction Pressure Cutout - The low suction pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the suction pressure is equal to or less than the setpoint.\r\nOil Pressure Cutout - The oil pressure cutout will shut down the compressor if the oil pressure equals or exceeds the setpoint.\r\n\r\nHigh Level Float Switch\r\n\r\nThe main suction accumulator is equipped with a high level float switch that is wired to shut down the compressors in the event of a high liquid level in the vessel. This prevents liquid ammonia from entering the compressors.\r\n\r\nMain Liquid Feed Shut-Off Valve (King Valve)\r\n\r\nThe high pressure receiver is equipped with a main liquid feed shut-off valve (king valve) that is clearly labeled and can be used to stop the flow of ammonia throughout the system.\r\n\r\nHigh Level Float Switch\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance to the machinery room is equipped with an emergency refrigeration switch (e-stop) that controls power to the refrigeration machinery inside the machinery room. The switch can be activated in an emergency using the hammer next to the switch to break the switch glass.\r\n\r\nProcess Classification\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at LS Farms consists of vessels, equipment, and valves which are interconnected by piping. As such, the refrigeration system at LS Farms is treated as a single process.\r\n\r\n1.3 General Accident Release & Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\r\n1.3.1 General\u00a0\r\n\r\nWe inform our employees engaged in process operations of the dangers of an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia in annual safety meetings. During these meeting we also discuss preventative measures, such as evacuation, in order to be prepared for a release.\r\n\r\nL.S. Farms has also conducted an off-site consequence analysis of worst-case and alternative release scenarios for the ammonia refrigeration process. These are for the purposes of informing the public in the event of an accidental release. The results of the analyses are reported in PSMWriter and hard copy binders.\u00a0\r\n\r\n1.3.2"

      "SummaryText": "Anhydrous Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe ammonia refrigeration process at the L.S. Farms facility is an integral part of the overall business and operates most of the year. It is extremely important that this process is maintained and operated in a safe and efficient manner. Management is committed to making sure that employees are made aware of the potential danger of an ammonia leak.\r\n\r\nOur refrigeration personnel monitor the ammonia refrigeration process and keep active records of all procedures and transactions that pertain to ammonia. In addition, the process is checked frequently by one of the outside refrigeration contractors that we use. These contractors also assist in performing the annual mechanical integrity inspection of our ammonia equipment.\u00a0\r\n\r\n1.4 Five Year Accident History\r\n\r\nL.S. Farms has had no accidental release within the last five (5) years.\r\n\r\n1.5 Emergency Action and Response Plan\r\n\r\nL.S. Farms' emergency action and response program has been developed to satisfy the following requirements:\r\n\r\nCal/OSHA's Emergency Action Plan - Title 8 CCR \u00a73220\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Emergency Action Plans - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.38\r\nCal/OSHA's Process Safety Management [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 8 CCR \u00a75189(n)\r\nU.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management [Emergency Planning and Response Requirements]- Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.119(n)\r\nCalifornia Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4.5 \u00a72765.1-2765.2\r\nUSEPA Risk Management Program [Emergency Response Program Requirements] - Title 40 CFR \u00a768.95\r\nCalifornia Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) [Emergency Response Plans and Procedures] - Title 19 CCR, Division 2, Chapter 4 \u00a72731\r\nCalifornia Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) - Title 8 CCR Title 8 \u00a75192(q)\r\nFederal Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response"

      "SummaryText": "(HAZWOPER) - Title 29 CFR \u00a71910.120(q)\r\n\r\nStrategically, we will respond minimally to a release. Under this plan we will call emergency personnel and evacuate the facility. All response activities would be done in coordination with the Local Fire Department and their Hazardous Materials Response Team.\u00a0\r\n\r\nEvery year we review with our employees our evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency, including a hazardous chemical release.\r\n\r\n1.6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nL.S. Farms has implemented many policies and procedures to promote overall plant, worker and public safety. Nevertheless, L.S. Farms continually strives to improve in all areas, including safety.\r\n\r\nBy utilizing PSMWriter software, all necessary employees have access to every aspect of the RMP-PSM program. This has improved L.S. Farms' ability to communicate hazardous situations to employees and contractors. In addition, PSMWriter tracks all RMP-PSM related events so that L.S. Farms' management team can ensure that the RMP-PSM program is being implemented.\r\n\r\nL.S. Farms has implemented all aspects of the RMP-PSM program. When a RMP-PSM program requirement is completed (i.e. mechanical integrity inspection, process hazard analysis, compliance audit, etc.) any specific action items related to that event are entered into PSMWriter, assigned a responsible person, and given a due date. Once the action item has been completed, the resolution can be documented using PSMWriter as well. A list of current or past due action items can be accessed at any time by those with access to PSMWriter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to utilizing PSMWriter to create, schedule, track, and document events, L.S. Farms has also entered into a contract with Resource Compliance to obtain help with RMP-PSM program implementation."
