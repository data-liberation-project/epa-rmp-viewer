The Safety/Environmental Manager periodically evaluates the health and safety practices of facility employees to ensure forklift safety, hazard communications, lockout/tagout, Hazardous Materials Emergency Business Plan, employee safety manuals, manufacturer's documentation, Emergency Action Plan as well as the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Plans are carried out.\n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\n\n\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy makes high quality dairy products with unrivaled flavor, quality, freshness and nutrition.  All our milk comes from California dairy farms.\n\n\n\nAlta-Dena Certified Dairy uses a regulated substance (Anhydrous Ammonia as a refrigerant in the refrigeration systems) in order to cool the milk during processing and to maintain the milk at a cold temperature while being handled in the milk coolers.  Anhydrous ammonia is an environmentally friendly and efficient chemical to use for refrigeration.  The anhydrous ammonia is contained within 2 closed-loop refrigeration systems.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the following risk management regulations:\n\n\n\n1)  OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM),\n\n2)  EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) and\n\n3)  OES California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program.\n\n\n\nThese regulations impose numerous requirements on the facility to ensure the safety of the public and on-site employees.  The following summarizes the key compliance programs that have been implemented by Alta-Dena Certified Dairy to prevent accidental release of anhydrous ammonia from the facility.

Operators are trained in-house and on the job as well as completing local RETA classes and ammonia refrigeration courses at the University of Wisconsin or similar institutions.  The mechanical integrity program ensures that the ammonia refrigeration systems are in proper working condition based upon routine checks, tests and inspections.  The Management of Change procedures are to ensure that process modifications are based on sound design principles and implemented in a safe manner.  A Pre-Startup Safety Review procedure is utilized as a check prior to ammonia being introduced into new equipment to be assured that the Management of Change procedures are completed.  A Hot Work Permit program ensures that Hot Work procedures are followed if Alta-Dena Certified Dairy employees or contractors are to perform hot work.  Contractors safety programs and records are evaluated.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nRefrigeration technicians (2) were attempting to replace a 1 ?\" liquid solenoid valve feeding V11. An adjacent ?\" to ?\" reducing bushing failed while technicians were loosening the 1 ?\" flange.  As technicians were uncoupling the solenoid valve, the ammonia pressure increased above the normal operating pressure of 30 psi due to the ammonia system shut down earlier that day and as the outside temperature increased, the ammonia inside the corroded bushing increased dislodging the gauge due to the bushing failure resulting in an ammonia gas leak.  The ammonia gas leaked for approximately 5 minutes (23 pounds) and the valve was quickly shut off by a Precision Refrigeration team.  The team responded with full-face air purifying respirators and work clothing.  One technician sustained second degree chemical burns to his left wrist to elbow that penetrated work clothing covering his arms and wrists.  He was sent to Arrowhead clinic by Precision Refrigeration, treated, and release"

He used a boom lift to get to ground level and complained of burning eyes and difficulty breathing.  He was sent to Concentra, evaluated, and released.  He had a follow-up check with the clinic the next day and released. \n\n\n\nEMERGENCY ACTION PLANS\n\n\n\nThe facility would utilized the Los Angeles County Fire Department as an Emergency Responder."
