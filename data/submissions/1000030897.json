The Zanesville facility employs 850 people when fully operational.  The site has one (1) covered process, Program Level 1, Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage, that is subject to chemical accident prevention regulations under Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act and 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 68.  The covered process has no public receptors within the distance to the endpoint (0.2 miles or 1,056 feet) from a worst-case release and has had no accidents with specific off-site consequences within the past five years.\n\nAvon's Global Safety Strategy has six (6) dimensions:\n\n1.    Increase management involvement;\n\n2.    Strengthen basic safety;\n\n3.    Set goals and measure performance;\n\n4.    Communicate and increase awareness;\n\n5.    Increase safety and health competence; and\n\n6.    Establish global standards.\n\n\n\nAssociates responsible for coordinating health and safety management report directly to the facility's Local Crisis Management Team (CMT Leader, Global Security Designee, Human Resources, Legal, Communications, Finance, Facilities, IT, Security, and EHS); the North American Regional Crisis Management Team (SVP & President NA, VP Finance, GVP NA Legal, VP Communications and Events, Executive Director IT, and VP HR NA); and the Global Crisis Management Team (CFO/Chief Strategy Officer, SVP General Counsel, SVP Global Communications, and SVP Human Resources).   By assigning health and safety responsibilities to the associates who are directly involved in the facility's operational areas and reporting directly to senior (local, regional, and global) management, the safety function becomes more effective and sends a clear message that ensuring safety is a basic management function and responsibility.  \n\nWhile Avon's focus is on pro"

At our Zanesville facility, capital went directly into the design and construction of the facility, which includes the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area.  This area was designed and built with the following attributes:\n\nA labyrinth design so that shrapnel could not escape the room should an explosion occur;\n\nA two (2) hour rated firewall;\n\nAn in-rack sprinkler system, eighteen sprinklers per rack section that, once activated, will release 30 gallons of water per minute;\n\no Sprinkler heads protected by a cage against damage;\n\no The system is triggered at 155 F;\n\nAn independent overhead sprinkler system;\n\no The system is triggered at 165 F;\n\nExterior doors that are clearly marked to designate the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area; and facility-wide fire alarm system.\n\n\n\nAvon's commitment to safety continues with our material handling policies.  These policies are in place as an administrative step to prevention.  These policies include the \"Handling & Storage of Aerosol Products\" Policy.  Components of this policy include, but are not limited to:\n\nMove unloaded aerosol pallet loads to the Warehouse Aerosol Room immediately and avoid temporary storage in the Receiving dock area;\n\nOnce an aerosol pallet has been delivered to the Warehouse Aerosol Room remove or cut the plastic off the top of the pallet to allow water penetration through the pallet in the event of a fire;\n\nUse only \"EE\" rated forklifts or manual power jacks to transport aerosol pallet loads;\n\nIn production areas only store the aerosol products required for one-shift;\n\nDesignate areas for \"holding\" aerosol products in production areas;\n\nStore pallet loads in aerosol storage cage"

Additionally, under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (Section 302) Avon Zanesville is required to notify state and local authorities of the hazardous and extremely hazardous substances stored over a threshold quantity.  These material disclosures assist the state and local authorities when developing a chemical emergency preparedness plan and coordinating response capabilities and communication.\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAvon, Zanesville has had no accidental releases of the subject flammable mixture in the past five years.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAvon, Zanesville has coordinated with Muskingum County Emergency Management Agency Director and 911 Coordinator, Bo Keck, and the Washington Township Fire Department Chief Gene Hanning.   Mr. Keck and Chief Hanning are very familiar with the site.  Chief Hanning has visited and photographed the location since construction activities were first initiated.  A PowerPoint presentation of the development of the site, its characteristics and features are included in the Washington Township Fire Department's training and the facility is accounted for in the most recent Zanesville Muskingum Area Haz-Mat Plan.  Fire personnel have been trained at the site three (3) times, at the time of the issuance of this plan.  Washington Township Fire Department does have a response plan for the facility, but at this time it is not in written form.  The Washington Township Fire Department is part of the Muskingum County \"Mutual Aid\" which is a coordinated effort between multiple Fire Departments in the area.  The Washington Township Fire Department has the most recent building, and fire plans, and completed the 200-foot grid for the fire hoses multiple times.  \n\n\n\nChief Hanning and his team are aware of the Aerosol Product Flammable Mixture Storage Area and the possible contents.
