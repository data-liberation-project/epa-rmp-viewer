The facility is staffed 24 hours a day by the engineering and maintenance department.  Walking through the facility is completed daily by in-house personnel to foresee any potential problems before they occur.  \n          The emergency response plan is intergrated with the off-site response plan (as required by SARA Title III, Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know-Act).  This plan includes guidelines to be followed in the event of a hazardous materials release, or any other emergency that might affect the safety, and / or the well-being of the facilities employees, and surrounding locations. \nB.  THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED:\n          This facility's primary function is a cold storage warehouse.  Various cold products (ie:  cheese, hot dogs, and meat) are brought in, and stored for a period of time, then shipped to various locations.  \n          Ammonia is used in an enclosed piping system to refrigerate the warehouse.  Presently there is 45,000 lbs of ammonia in the refrigeration system.\nC.  THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO LIMIT THE DISTANCES FOR EACH REPORTED SCENARIO:\n          Worst case scenario = The pipe on the high pressure liquid return line is severed at the roof top condenser causing the facility to lose the whole charge of 45,000 lbs of ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint is 3.4 miles if the whole charge is lost.  Passive mitigation controls considered are to shut down the system, and isolate the ammonia in the vessels.  This would stop the liquid ammonia from blowing out into the atmosphere.\n          Alternative release scenario = A flange gasket on the roof top condenser's isolation valve on the gas discharge line fails with the ammonia leaking from the gasket.

GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n          This facility complies with all applicable Federal and State regulations for accidental release prevention.  The emergency response plan has site-specific procedures outlined, which includes contacting Tanner Industries, Inc. to assist employees and Philadelphia Hazmat teams.\nE.  THE FIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n          This facility has had no accidental releases with-in the last five years.\nF.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n          This facilities emergency response plan is in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration's regulations 1910.38 (employee emergency plan) with detailed information regarding a hazardous materials release.\nG.  PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n          Key personnel from each shift will be certified as a Hazmat Technician."
