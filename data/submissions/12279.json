Headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio, Geon and its subsidiaries employ more than 3,300 people and have 28 manufacturing plants worldwide.  The Pedricktown facility manufactures speciality dispersion resins. Dispersion resins are used in a wide array of products including resilient vinyl flooring, vinyl gloves, toys, weather stripping, spray coating, can coatings, carpet backing, adhesives and adhesive bandage strips. \n \nDuring the last two years, Geon has proactively been discussing the most recent Risk Management Program regulatory requirements with community and county officials.  This activity included educational sessions and tours with emergency response personnel, discussion of regulated materials and the prevention programs in place to prevent releases, emergency response capabilities and methods and considerations used to calculate worse-case and alternative release scenarios.  This proactive activity included sharing all of the information with the general community in May 1999.   \n\nGEON'S ACCIDENTIAL RELEASE PREVENTION & EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY\n\nThe Geon Company has a strong commitment to accidental release prevention and emergency response as stated in the Plant Manager's Safety and Health Message, Company Environmental Policy and Company Safety and Health Policy.  Geon has fulfilled this commitment through a long history of outstanding safety performance, including receipt of the New Jersey Governor's Award and numerous industry and company awards for safety and environmental excellence.  Geon has also provided long term leadership in emergency response preparedness for both the Pedricktown community and Salem County.\n\n\nPLANT MANAGER'S SAFETY& HEALTH MESSAGE\n\nThe Safety and"

All employees and visitors have the \"License to be safe\" and are authorized to delay the start of any task or job until all of their safety concerns have been satisfied.  With each of us personally responsible for our own safety and well-being, our plant will continue to be successful and viable in the future.\n\n\nCOMPANY ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n\nIt is the policy of the Geon Company to conduct our operations in a manner fully protective of employees, customers, public health and the environment. Implementation of this policy shall be through programs which are proactive in nature and go beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Geon's commitment to the principles of Responsible Care provides clear guidance for action.  \n\nWe will conduct ongoing evaluation of our operations and products to identify practical opportunities for continuing reduction of releases and wastes. We are committed to a continued reduction of emissions and permit exceedances, as well as, minimizing the generation of solid and hazardous waste.  \n\nExcellence in program leadership and stewardship is a key management responsibility. Insuring that all operations in the company are carried out in accordance with this Policy is the responsibility of each employee.\n\n\nCOMPANY SAFETY & HEALTH POLICY\n\nThe policy of our Company is to safeguard the health and well-being of each employee and our neighbors.

The development of safety awareness can only come through each person's acceptance of his responsibility for safety in conjunction with adequate job orientation, training, recognition and communication of the hazards associated with each work situation. Everyone must believe that all accidents are either preventable or avoidable.\n\nEffective management of our process safety is critical in maintaining the integrity of our operations. All necessary equipment, tools, technologies, procedures, and training will be provided to assist everyone in operating our processes and performing their jobs safely. At Geon every job and operation must be managed safely.  \n\nSafety performance will be a key element of each employee's and contractor's performance evaluation.  Excellence in safety performance is a condition of employment at Geon.  \n\nThe prevention of accidents while off the job is equally important. The same principles at work are also effective in preventing accidents in the home, on the highway and in all other activities.\n\nWorking and living safely must be our way of life. \n\n\n REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nGeon is regulated under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA), which regulate the management of process safety.  The OSHA Process Safety Management Standard regulation is designed to protect workers from catastrophic process incidents and the TCPA regulation is designed to protect the public and the environment.

Vinyl Chloride is used to manufacture dispersion speciality resins.  It is polymerized (reacted and converted) into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which is an inert plastic.  This conversion takes place in a closed computerized process using state of the art technology.  The product is then dried, packaged and shipped to customers.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to make chilled water.  The chilled water is used to remove heat from the dispersion manufacturing process.\n\n\nRELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nThe NJDEP and the USEPA accident prevention regulations require companies to analyze what is defined as a worse-case release scenario.  Companies are also required to analyze an alternative release scenario.  \n\nThe worse-case scenario is a hypothetical release of the largest quantity of any toxic material or flammable listed under the regulations as determined by USEPA.  The USEPA mandates that companies presume the release of the entire quantity of the substance in ten (10) minutes.  Geon could not consider the numerous prevention and emergency response systems, procedures, equipment, controls, and trained employees that are in place as part of this scenario.\n\nThe alternative case scenario is a more credible scenario that is closer to a real world incident.  Facilities are allowed to include active safety systems.  Active safety systems include procedures and equipment which are used to contain or minimize the impact of an accidental release.  Examples of active safety systems are detection systems, computer controlled valves, fire protection systems and employee actions.\n\n\nWORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO\n\nGeon has one regulated flammable substance: Vinyl Chloride (VCM) CAS No. 75-01-4\nThe worse-case scenario assumes the failure of the largest storage tank.

It is assumed that the entire contents are released within ten minutes and find an ignition source.  The result is a vapor cloud explosion.  The distance from the source to its endpoint is 0.22 miles.  For flammables, the endpoint is the level at which a fire or explosion could damage dwelllings or hurt people.  Distance to the endpoint for Vinyl  Chloride was found in Table 9 in the USEPA Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance. \n\nGeon has one regulated toxic substance: Ammonia (anhydrous) CAS No. 7664-41-7\nThe worst case scenario assumes failure of the largest single heat exchanger.  This heat exchanger has a capacity of 1,850 gallons; however, written operating procedures and high level alarms prevent more than 650 gallons from being present at one time. Failure of this heat exchanger would release 650 gallons (3,500 pounds) of ammonia.  It is assumed that the entire contents are released within ten minutes.  The distance from the source to its endpoint is 1.2 miles.  For toxic materials, the endpoint is the chemical concentration in the air to which a person can be exposed for up to one hour without serious health effects.
