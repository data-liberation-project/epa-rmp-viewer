In the event of an emergency involving the regulated aqueous ammonia, Cascade Tissue will notify the Eau Claire Fire Department HAZMAT team and the local private HAZMAT contractor, RESCO, for assistance. The emergency response plan includes a section for chemical releases under 40 CFR Part 68 and will be used for primary response and responsibilities by Cascade Tissue for notification and evacuation. In addition, Cascade Tissue participated in an exercise for emergency response for their regulated ammonia system with the Eau Claire Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Eau community emergency response plans as well as private HAZMAT contractors in the area and other fire departments to facilitate response to ammonia release from the facility and the responsibilities of all parties. In addition, other hazards were identified from Cascade although they are exempt from RMP.   \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nBased on Cascade Tissue meeting with the Eau Claire Planning Committee, Fire Departments and private HAZMAT companies, Cascade Tissue will be updating their emergency response plan to improvements and procedures identified during the meeting. The review of the Process Hazard Analysis began on May 6, 2024 but has not been finalized."
