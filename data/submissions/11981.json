      "SummaryText": "It is the policy of Blanchard Valley Farmers Cooperative, Inc., Mount Blanchard Branch, to prevent an accidental release of anhydrous ammonia by maintaining the equipment and training the employees in the proper procedures in the storage and handling of the material.  In the case of an emergency we would rely on the Delawaare Township Fire Department to control the situation.  The stationary source is two storage tanks plumbed together containing a maximum of 110,000 pounds of product.  The worst-case scenario would be a total loss of the contents of both tanks.  The alternative release scenario would be a loss occuring when a transfer hose fails.  There are no administrative controls which can limit the distance of the potential material release.  The mitigation measures that limit the distance to the potential material release are the excess flow valves.  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are to adhere to the normal operation procedures for using an ammonia fertilizer tank.  The five-year accident history is void of any releases from the storage tanks.  The emergency response program in case of an ammonia leak is as follows:  1) Evacuate all non-essential personnel to main office building; 2) Notify management; 3) Determine size of the leak, if less than 100 pounds, a) use proper PPE; b) stop flow of gas, if possible; c) allow liquid to vaporize or absorb with water - if more than 100 pounds, a) notify fire department and b) use proper PPE; 4) Notify Hancock LEPC, notify National Response Center, notify Ohio EPA, notify Ohio Dept. of Natural Resourses, notify Ohio Dept. of Agriculture, and notify CHEMTREC; 5) Notify Risk Coordinator.  There are no planned changes to improve safety at this time."
