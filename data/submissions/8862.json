      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\nIntroduction and Background\n\nThe USEPA's Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included provisions that require facilities that use certain substances to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. The plan must also include mitigation measures to reduce the potential impact on the public in the unlikely event of a release. The requirements of this plan, commonly referred to as a Risk Management Plan (RMP), are detailed and codified in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake City (the District) Little Cottonwood Water Treatment Plant (LCWTP) and the Deer Creek Intake Structure (DCIS) stores chlorine in quantities above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP/PSM is required. Chlorine is used at the LCWTP to disinfect the drinking water prior to public consumption and periodically at the DCIS to control biofouling of the pipe.\n\nThe RMP/PSM consists of three compliance programs, each with progressively stricter compliance standards. Since the District is a political subdivision of the State of Utah, State and federal OSHA regulations do not expressly apply.  However, the District is required by the Utah Labor Code to operate and maintain an occupational safety and health program equivalent to the program for other employers in the state.  The District generally does this by looking to OSHA regulations for guidance, subject to the District's ability to independently make decisions which best meet its safety needs.  Consistent with this approach the District has chosen to use the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards as a guide.  For this reason, and the fact that a worst-case release of chlorine could affect the public, the chlorination process at LCWTP and DCIS will be treated as subject to Program 3, the most stringent of the three programs.\n\nThe RMP/PSM consists of three major parts. The f"

The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the RMP and PSM regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program for the EPA RMP also serve as a substantively equivalent OSHA PSM plan.\n\nHazard Assessment\n\nA hazard assessment was performed to evaluate the effects that a release would have on the public. The hazard assessment includes examining the water treatment plant's 5-year accident history and hypothetical worst-case and alternative release scenario. An examination of the LCWTP and the DCIS's accident history reveals that no accidents have occurred with respect to the chlorine process in the last 5 years. For the worst-case and alternative release scenarios, the distance from the point of release to the \"toxic endpoint,\" or the location at which individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing serious health effects, was approximated. An estimate of the population potentially affected by a release of chlorine was also determined, along with sensitive receptors such as hospitals and schools.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe hazard assessment requires that the \"toxic endpoint\", or distance from the point of release to a location at which the chlorine concentration equals 3 ppm, must be determined.\n\nThe regulations require the development of a worst-case release scenario based on conservative assumptions. For a 1-ton chlorine container, which is the largest size LCWTP and DCIS handles, it is required to assume that 2,000 pounds of chlorine will be released over 10 minutes.  It should be noted that this is unlikely to occur since th"

In addition, the worst-case scenario requires that conservative atmospheric conditions be assumed that result in a large area of impact. To model this scenario for both facilities, the EPA's computer program RMP*Comp was used. This program approximates the impact radius at which the chlorine concentration is equal to or exceeds the \"toxic endpoint\". \n\nLCWTP\n\nThe radius is a distance of 1.3 miles from the chlorine storage area at the LCWTP.  It should be noted that for the LCWTP, the urban setting was used which assumes that numerous obstacles, including buildings and trees will hinder the dispersion of chlorine. \n\nDCIS\n\nThe radius is a distance of 3.0 miles from the chlorine storage area at the DCIS.  It should be noted that for the DCIS, the rural setting was used which assumes that the terrain is open, flat and unobstructed. This assumption was used to present a more conservative scenario due to the confined nature of the river valley.\n\nBecause the cloud from a chlorine leak would disperse relatively quickly, an individual at a \"toxic endpoint\" would be exposed to the exposure limit concentration for much less than the 1 hour assumed by the limit. In addition, the exposure limit concentrations result in relatively minor health effects. Therefore, an individual at the toxic endpoint would be affected less than the results of the worst-case scenario may imply.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nThe RMP rule also requires that at least one alternative release scenario be evaluated for chlorine. The alternative release scenario reflects a type of release that is more likely to occur compared to the worst-case scenario. The alternative release scenario selected by the District staff was a release of chlorine through a leaking fusible plug on the chlorine cylinder. Using RMP*Comp for this scenario at both facilities, the radius of impact is approximately 0.2 mil"

This alternative release scenario is considered to be more representative of the effects likely in the event of a release.\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Prevention Program, together with the Emergency Response Program, make up the RMP/PSM. The Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe participation of the District staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program's successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff's experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\n\nDistrict staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program by participating in the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below. The operations and maintenance staff also participated in the development of the RMP by reviewing and commenting on operating and maintenance procedures and safe work practices; these personnel will continue to review and update these practices and procedures on a regular basis.  All District staff received RMP/PSM awareness training that instructed staff on how the RMP/PSM requirements may impact their jobs. Staff who operate and maintain the RMP/PSM processes were trained in how to safely maintain and operate the processes.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe RMP regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of a RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information will be supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine areas as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element.

This information was used by District staff to improve safety and reduce the consequences of accidental releases. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine process.\n\nThe chlorine PHA was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of District staff familiar with the process operation and maintenance and plant management. The PHA was done using a combination of \"What-If\" and \"Checklist\" methods. Based on the results of the PHAs, numerous changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the District were identified. The changes that most affect the severity and likelihood of a release have been adopted by the District and incorporated as part of the overall Process Safety Management Program. The other improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards are scheduled to be implemented or incorporated.\n\nAll changes resulting from the PHA are scheduled to be completed by approximately August 1, 1999.  One potential change resulting from the findings of the PHA, a seismic upgrade of the facility, is currently being considered by the District.  Due to the high cost, this upgrade may take years to complete.  Because there are currently no definitive plans to complete this activity, it was not considered in the August 1 completion date listed below.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nOperating procedures for the chlorination process have been updated as part of the RPM/PSM.

The procedures describe how the system should be operated in order to minimize the chances of an accidental release. The procedures also emphasize safety considerations during operation and address hazardous situations that can occur and how to correct them.\n\nTraining\n\nAn effective RMP/PSM training program can significantly reduce the number and severity of accidental release incidences. Employees involved in operating or maintaining the chlorination process must receive training that includes applicable operating and maintenance procedures and an overview of the process. Training must emphasize safety and health hazards and safe work practices.\n\nDistrict staff have received initial training on the operations and maintenance of the regulated processes, an overview of each of the RMP/PSM plan elements, and the procedures that must be followed to comply with the requirements of the RMP/PSM plan. In addition to RMP/PSM plan training, select District staff have been trained to respond to an accidental release. Refresher process operation training must be provided at least every 3 years. Refresher training for emergency response is conducted annually.\n\nContractors\n\nThe District must make contractors aware of the known hazards of the chlorine process related to the contractors' work.

Upon arriving at the plant for the first time to perform work, the contractor will be presented a Contractor Safety Management Briefing Form that must be read and signed. All contractors should receive an Emergency Response Summary Sheet. \n\nPre-startup Review\n\nA pre-startup safety review must be conducted for any new covered process or for significant modifications to the existing chlorine process that necessitate a change in the process safety information. No new or significantly modified process will start up and no acutely hazardous chemicals will be introduced into such a process prior to the pre-startup safety review. The purpose of the pre-startup safety review is to ensure that the facility is ready to operate new and modified regulated processes safely. \n\nTo initiate the pre-startup safety review, all updated elements of the Process Safety Management Plan are assembled for review. This includes all process safety information, process hazard analysis, operating procedures, employee training and mechanical integrity. A pre-startup safety review team completes a pre-startup checklist. The pre-startup safety review team should complete and sign a Pre-startup Safety Review Form.

The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\n\nThe District maintenance staff use a computerized maintenance management system, referred to as the Preventative Maintenance (PMC) to store equipment information, generate and prioritize work orders, schedule preventative maintenance, provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. The PMC system is used to generate work orders for preventative maintenance. In addition to preventative maintenance, the District staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. Work orders indicate what safety precautions must be followed including whether lockout/tagout or confined space entry provisions are applicable. The staff that carryout maintenance are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM.\n\nHot Works Permits\n\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \"hot work\" in, on, or around the chlorine process. To ensure that hot work is done safely, a Hot Work Permit Program has been developed that requires a permit to be issued before hot work is performed. Hot work is defined as the use of oxyacetylene torches, welding equipment, grinders, cutting, brazing, or similar flame- or spark-producing operations.\n\nThe process of completing the hot work permit makes it necessary to identify the hazard, recognize what safeguards are appropriate, and then initiate the safeguards necessary to ensure a fire-safe workplace. Following the standards outlined in this section of the RMP aid in complying with the OSHA Hot Works Regulations (1910.252(a)).\n\nManagement of Change\n\nA system for the proper management of changes and modifications to equipment, procedures, chemicals, and processing conditions is required under the RMP/PSM.

A Management of Change Committee will evaluate any modifications that are covered under the RMP/PSM. The Management of Change Committee will complete a Management of Change Form that the Water Quality Manager will review and authorize prior to initiation of a covered change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, an investigation team will be established. As part of the investigation, an incident report will be prepared to recommend system changes.\n\nThe investigation team should ask questions such as what equipment failed, which behavior failed, and which material leaked, reacted, or exploded? As part of the incident review, staff actions that may have contributed to the incident will also be reviewed. A determination will be made as to whether it is necessary to institute additional training for the employees to prevent the incident from occurring in the future. On the incident report form, the Water Quality Manager identifies which of the recommended system changes are approved for implementation.
