      "SummaryText": "This executive summary provides a brief overview of the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the associated policies at the Las Vegas Street Wastewater Treatment Plant (Las Vegas Street WWTP), one of several facilities owned and operated by the Colorado Springs Utilities.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nColorado Springs Utilities has determined that this facility is required to comply with RMP Program 2.  Colorado Springs Utilities believes that it is important to provide a safe workplace to its employees and minimize the impact of its operations on the surrounding community and the environment.  Accordingly, Colorado Springs Utilities has developed proactive safety and environmental programs, which are reliant upon active employee participation and management leadership and support.  This same proactive philosophy was employed in the development and implementation of the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems. \n\nThe RMP prevention program is arguably the most important element of the rule.  Its program elements require the active participation of facility employees and management in conducting activities aimed at preventing accidental releases of regulated chemicals.  If prevention activities could be completely successful, there would be no need for emergency response activities, since no releases would occur.  Accordingly, a well-developed and properly implemented prevention program will lower the possibility of an accidental release and minimize the consequences of a release should one occur.\n\nColorado Springs Utilities takes an active role in preventing accidental releases at all of its facilities by ensuring that its employees are well-informed regarding the hazards associated with the regulated processes (e.g., chlorine and sulfur dioxide at the Las Vegas Street WWTP), and actively participate in comprehensive hazard reviews.  Employees are properly trained in the safe operation of the covered process"

They are aided in this work by complete, understandable system operating procedures.\n\nColorado Springs Utilities management understands its duty to provide a safe working environment and to take measures to prevent accidents that may have an effect on the surrounding community.  This understanding is reflected in procedures described and referenced in the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP procedures and policies.\n\nColorado Springs Utilities has established and maintains emergency procedures.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodic basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\nThe Las Vegas Street WWTP is located at: 825 Las Vegas Street, Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado.  The Las Vegas Street WWTP treats wastewater through a series of physical, biological, and chemical treatment operations.  The facility provides service to over 300,000 people residing within a 150 square-mile area.  An average of 45 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater is treated daily; the maximum treatment rate of the facility is 75 MGD (wet) or 65 MGD (dry).\n\nThe Las Vegas Street WWTP utilizes chlorine as a disinfecting agent in the treatment of wastewater and sulfur dioxide for the dechlorination of treated effluent.  The Las Vegas Street WWTP is regulated under Program 2 of the RMP rule due to the volume of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored and used at the facility.\n\nPREVENTION STEPS FOR CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE\nThe prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps are described in detail in the Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP manual.  The prevention program includes the following elements:\n? Safety information, which includes information pertaining to the hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide in the process, process technology, and process equipment\n? Hazard review, which includes a systematic evaluation (by an employee team) of the following:  hazards"

Operating procedures, which include steps for each operating phase, operating limits, safety and health considerations, and safety systems and their functions\n? Training for each Las Vegas Street WWTP employee involved in operating the chlorine system\n? Computerized maintenance program including schedules and job plans to maintain the on-going integrity of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide process equipment\n? Compliance audits at least every three years from 1999 to evaluate Las Vegas Street WWTP RMP compliance\n? Incident investigation, to be conducted and documented for each incident that resulted in, or could have reasonably resulted in, a catastrophic release of chlorine from the Las Vegas Street WWTP\n\nIn addition to these elements, the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage facility at the Las Vegas Street WWTP is equipped with a chemical scrubber.  In the event of a release of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the storage rooms, the normal ventilation system shuts down and the contaminated air is sent to the scrubber for neutralization.  The scrubber is maintained and tested on a regular basis to ensure proper operation during a chemical release event.\n\nACCIDENT HISTORY\nAn accidental release occurred in the Las Vegas WWTP chlorine room on March 3, 2006.  This release did not result in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  The release did not exceed the EPA chlorine reportable quantity of 10lbs.  \n\nAn estimated 1.86lbs of 99.5% molar solution of chlorine was released from the chlorine room.  As a result of this release, it is now required that w"

      "SummaryText": "hen new pipeline is installed or replaced at the Las Vegas WWTP, the new pipeline must be cleaned of debris before it is put into service.  Tighter security was also implemented around the chlorine and sulfur dioxide buildings.  Only authorized personnel have access to the building, and doors are to remain closed at all times.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThis facility is included in the Colorado Springs LEPC Emergency Response Plan.  The Las Vegas WWTP has also established and maintains emergency procedures, which includes an evacuation and notification plan.  The goals of the established procedures are to protect onsite employees from the hazardous effects of chemical releases and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public.  The procedures are routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes.  Colorado Springs Utilities works closely with the Colorado Springs LEPC and other local industries and agencies to coordinate local response activities.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES FOR IMPROVED SAFETY\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees.  Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the Las Vegas Street WWTP.  Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and to present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards."
