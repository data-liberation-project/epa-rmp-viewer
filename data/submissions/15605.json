      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Sanitary District of Hammond (HSD) is a municipal wastewater treatment facility located in Hammond, Indiana.  Employees of HSD, as well as contractors and subcontractors, are subject to potential risks of personal injury from exposure to noxious gases.  The gases of concern are chlorine (Cl2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) which are listed under  Section 112 (r) (risk management program to prevent and respond to accidental releases of regulated substances) of the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments.  In addition, HSD is required to comply with Federal, State and Local regulations on wastewater treatment and solid waste management as they apply to waste treatment facilities.  HSD has implemented the risk management plan (RMP) to meet Section 112 (r) requirements, which is summarized herein.  The facility is also subject to regulations under the Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119), thus Program 3 of the risk management program is applicable to the covered processes, i.e., storage of Cl2 and SO2 at HSD.\n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nHSD uses Cl2 and SO2 in the treatment of wastewater to ensure that microbes in the discharge or effluent are substantially killed or destroyed and the chlorine level in the effluent is sufficiently low and does not impact water quality of the receiving stream, i.e., Grand Calumet River. Cl2 and SO2 are supplied as a liquefied compressed gas in one-ton containers having the capacity of 2,000 pounds each.  Standard containers valves are used and are equipped with fusible metal pressure relief devices, or fusible plugs.  These fusible plugs are designed to yield or melt between 158 F and 165 F to relieve pressure and prevent rupture of the container in case of fire or other exposure to high temperature.\n\nEmployees are responsible for the transfer of ton containers from the deli"

All containers are stored on designated wooden racks in a horizontal position.  On-line use, staging and storage of all full ton containers occur inside the Chlorine Building located approximately 200 feet east of the Administration Building.  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are currently being established and implemented at the facility.  The SOPs include handling of ton containers during loading/offloading, staging and storage.  MSDS sheets regarding specific chemical information and safe handling are kept on-site and made available to all employees.  Formal process is being implemented/documented to meet Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) requirements.  To date, all employees have an understanding of what hazards are present and the safety procedures for handling chemicals used in the processes.  Also, written maintenance procedures are being developed for the facility, but maintenance personnel do perform regular equipment checks and provide maintenance as necessary.\n\nThe amount of chemical in use and in storage at the facility at all times is as follows:  Chlorine (approximately 24,000 lbs) and SO2 (approximately 18,000 lbs).  Workers at the facility could potentially be exposed to Cl2 and SO2 gases should an accidental release occur.  Risks to workers include exposure to noxious gases from a leaking or ruptured container and leaking or broken pipes leading from the containers into the header pipe and vaporizers.  Therefore, this Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared to address this realistic release scenario; other release scenarios should be similar or of a lesser degree to this scenario.  The impacts of natural catastrophies on the covered processes are not evaluated in the RMP.
