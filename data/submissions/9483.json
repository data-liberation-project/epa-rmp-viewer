      "SummaryText": "Facility Information\n\nAdvanced Silicon Materials Inc.'s (ASiMI) Moses Lake, Washington facility is a manufacturer of silane and polycrystalline silicon for the electronics industry.  ASiMI occupies an 80-acre plot, which is located 5 miles east of Moses Lake, Washington on Road N NE.  The neighborhood is predominantly agricultural with several food processing plants, another chemical manufacturing facility, an industrial gas cylinder filling facility and a corrugated cardboard production plant in the vicinity.\n\nProcess Overview \n\nThe ASiMI facility in Moses Lake, WA is comprised of three different production units: 1) Silane, 2) Poly Reaction, and 3) Product Finishing. \n\nThe Silane Unit, through a series of chemical reactions and separation steps, converts metallurgical silicon and hydrogen to a high purity silane gas.  Intermediates produced in the process are trichlorosilane and dichlorosilane.  Some of the silane is packaged in tube trailers and modules and temporarily stored prior to sale.  The Poly Reaction Unit uses the majority of the silane and converts it into hydrogen and polycrystalline silicon.  The hydrogen is recycled back to the Silane Unit and the polycrystalline silicon is forwarded to the Product Finishing unit for mechanical processing and packaging. \n\nThere is one covered process as defined by the RMP regulations at the Moses Lake facility.  This process includes the Silane and Poly Reaction production areas which are interconnected, and the silane module storage area located adjacent to the Silane production area. Together these areas are identified as the Polysilicon Manufacturing process.\n\nThis risk management plan uses predictive filing to account for variables in the total quantities of chemicals at the facility, and for planned changes to the facility.  With predictive filing, the maximum quantity of chemicals that would be in the process at any one time is specified in this plan.\n\nChemicals: \n\nAdvanced Silicon has identified the foll"

All RMP applicable chemicals at the source are classified as flammables. \n\nIn addition to the above RMP-covered chemicals, Advanced Silicon has identified other potentially hazardous chemicals which could have either onsite or offsite impacts.  Risks from both these non RMP-covered chemicals as well as the RMP-covered chemicals are minimized using similar design standards, procedures, controls, mitigation measures, and emergency response procedures.   Advanced Silicon is also working with the local Department of Emergency Management and the Local Emergency Planning Committee to coordinate emergency planning and emergency response for all potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nWorst-Case Scenarios:\n\nFour hypothetical worst-case scenarios were identified and developed for the facility in accordance with RMP standards:\n\nThe full hydrogen storage tank releases its entire contents, 8,500 pounds of hydrogen, which explodes with 10% explosion efficiency and no mitigation.  The calculated distance to 1-psi overpressure is 0.23 miles.

The other 4 accidental releases only caused on-site impacts, but local industries were advised to shelter employees in place as a precaution during the 8/31/94 release.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAdvanced Silicon's accidental release prevention program is based on the following essential elements: \nhazard reviews of equipment and processes, preventative and predictive maintenance programs, a management of change program, operator job certification and performance testing, accurate operating procedures, internal and external auditing and inspection programs, accident and near-miss investigations, etc.  Advanced process monitoring and control systems are in use at the facility, and critical parameters are monitored with duplicate instrumentation.  Loss of utilities is protected against through the use of installed and routinely tested back-up systems.  Engineering and design standards ensure materials and equipment meet industry specifications.  Advanced Silicon is known as an industry leader in silane handling safety.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAdvanced Silicon's emergency response program has been coordinated with the local Department of Emergency Management and LEPC.  The program includes information on locations, quantities, and associated hazards of materials at the facility, as well as fixed and portable methods for containment and/or suppression of spills and releases, internal and external notification and communications procedures, alarm systems and evacuation plans.  The facility itself is designed with numerous mitigating features, including containment and diking, deluge systems for fire and vapor suppression, strategically-placed fire hydrants and fire monitors, and emergency scrubber systems.  Automatic and manual shutdown systems as well as automatic isolation valves are in place.  Back-up fire water supplies and firewater pumps are installed.  Emergenc"

The team performs realistic monthly drills and exercises, covering a variety of response scenarios such as spill containment and cleanup, vapor suppression, fire fighting, and response to injuries.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nAdvanced Silicon continues to seek and identify opportunities to improve safety through process hazard analyses, safety reviews and inspections, internal and external audits, incident and near-miss investigations, employee and safety committee suggestions, etc.   For example, a number of recommended actions to improve safety were identified in the latest external audit.  These recommendations are currently being reviewed and implemented as required."
