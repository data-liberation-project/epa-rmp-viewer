      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe Copperhead Chemical Company Inc. facility at 120 River Road, Tamaqua, Pennsylvania manufactures nitrate esters for use in various pharmaceutical blends and propellants that are also manufactured at the facility.  The company employs 31 people at the facility in a union environment.  The property consists of 875 acres in Walker Township in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.  Facility boundaries include Oak Ridge Hunting Club to the West, Pennsylvania Game Land and private residences to the north and the Little Schuylkill River to the east and south.\n\n\n\nThe two regulated substances handled above the Risk Management Program (RMP) threshold quantity at the facility are nitric acid and oleum in a mixed acid.  Pure nitric acid is 52% of the mixture.  Oleum is 48% of the mixture.  The oleum constituent is classified as maximum 10% meaning that a maximum of 10% of the oleum is free sulfur trioxide.  The remainder of the oleum is sulfuric acid.  Mixed acid is stored in two aboveground stainless steel tanks, one with a capacity of 6,700 gallons (93,599 pounds) and the other with a capacity of 8,000 gallons ( 111,760 pounds).\n\n\n\nThe mixed acid is delivered via tank trucks to the storage tanks where it is stored until needed in the nitration process at the facility.  Nitrate esters are produced in a batch nitrator by reacting pre-weighed glycerin with the mixed acid.  During the process the nitrator is chilled by a solution that is regulated by a refrigeration system.  Nitrate esters are separated from spent acid and then washed with water in prewash tanks.  A drown tank is also available for emergency situations.  Reaction of the nitric acid in the nitrator is the last step in the process that uses the regulated substance.\n\n\n\nCopperhead Chemical Company is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard in 29 CFR 1910.119 and maintains an existing PSM program for mixed acid (nitric acid and oleum) and the manufacture of nitrate esters.

      "SummaryText": " program includes the following production areas at the facility: Nitration, Neutralizer, Mix & Pack, and Pharmaceutical Blending.  The mixed acid that is subject to RMP is part of the Nitration Process that is included in PSM.  Many sections of the RMP have already been completed for the facility in the PSM program.\n\n\n\nCopperhead maintains a detailed emergency response plan in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120 and 25 PA Code 264, Subchapter D (264.51 through 264.56).  The SHE Supervisor serves as facility coordinator and incident commander for implementation of the emergency response plan. Employees are trained to respond to minor accidental releases at the facility.  Copperhead maintains a contract with an off-site emergency responder for large scale environmental emergencies.  The plan is coordinated with the Schuylkill County LEPC and is included in the community off-site release plan.\n\n\n\nCopperhead Chemical Company has taken precautions to ensure that the off-site effects of releases of toxic chemicals are minimal.  Prevention measures include a comprehensive preventive maintenance program, detailed unloading procedures, daily inspections, extensive operator training, and pre-startup inspections for the nitration process.  The Copperhead PSM program includes the following sections that are in practice at the facility. \n\n\n\n?    Process Safety Information\n\n?    Process Hazard Review\n\n?

Contractors\n\n?    Employee Participation\n\n?    Hot Work Permits \n\n\n\nIn the event of the worst case release scenario, rupture of a mixed acid tank, the spill would be contained inside of emergency containment.  The release of the contents of the 6,700 gallon tank is modeled as the worst case release scenario rather than the 8,000 gallon tank because the configuration of the containment structures results in a great distance to toxic endpoint for "
