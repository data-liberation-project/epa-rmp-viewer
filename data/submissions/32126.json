The Facility Policy:\n\nThe Facility owner, management, and employees of ConAgra International Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  Local responders are encouraged to visit the Facility to gain first hand knowledge of the site. Employees are required to hold monthly safety meeting and include sections of the management plan in those meetings.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire departments, and other authorities to mitigate any release, and to minimize the impact of a release on the population and environment.\n\nII.   Facility Information:\n\nThe primary activity of the Facility is to distribute agricultural fertilizer for the farming industry in the area.  Part of the fertilizer comes in the form of Anhydrous Ammonia, here after referred to as ammonia.  Ammonia is received, store, and used in the production of non-hazardous liquid fertilizer solutions. Ammonia is an important source of Nitrogen for agricultural crops during the spring and fall of the year.\n \nThe maximum quantity that can be stored at the facility is 53,000 pounds.  The typical method of receiving ammonia is by truck transport containing 40,000 pounds. Transports are unloaded through a permanent piping system approved by the State of Iowa?s Ag department.  The batch process is a large consumer of the product but is intermittently operated.  \n\nThe Facility recently discontinued using the locations stationary ammonium polyphosphate process unit and contracts the process to be done by a portable unit.  This has reduce the time it take to produce the finish product.  Since the portable is able to produce finish product faster, it has reduced the length of time the process has to be operating.\n\nIII.  Accidental Release Prevention:\n   \nThe Facility takes guidance from material published by the American National Standards Institute \""

The Facility tries to minimize the amount of ammonia held or stored at the facility through management judgment. All employees involved with the handling and processing are trained in their duties. The Facility continues to review and look for means to improve operating and Best management Practices for increase safety. \n\nThe contractor of the portable unit has in place a Process Safety Plans, and provide the necessary experience and training to handle the batching process safely while at the site.\n\nIV. The Five Year Accident History:\n       \nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia related to the operation of this facility in  the past five years.  There have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the Facility.  \n         \nTo the best of our knowledge, no off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage has occurred due to the operation of this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography / References:\nTechnical Inc. prepared for NIOSH, HAZOP of  ?Anhydrous Ammonia Use in Agricultural? 1991.\n\nClements Associates, Inc., Fairfax, VA;  ?Health Effects for Ammonia, prepared for The Fertilizer Institute.\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  ?Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Advisory ?
