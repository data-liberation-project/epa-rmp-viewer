Portland Water District (PWD) is committed to operating the East End Wastewater Treatment Plant in Portland, Maine  (Plant) in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe work place for its employees and the surrounding community.  PWD has implemented several safety programs designed to eliminate or reduce the potential for accidental releases.  PWD has also implemented several response policies and procedures within the plant to respond to potential releases.\n\nB. The plant treats wastewater collected from the greater Portland area and septage received from several adjacent towns.  Wastewater treatment includes primary clarification, biological treatment in activated sludge reactors, secondary clarification, and disinfection.  Wastewater is disinfected by chlorination (using gaseous chlorine) and then de-chlorinated (using gaseous sulfur dioxide) before discharge to Casco Bay.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are the RMP covered substances at the plant.\n\nC. PWD is subject to the Program 3 Prevention Program and is subject to the same elements as the OSHA PSM program for the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  These include programs related to: Employee Participation; Process Safety Information; Process Hazard Analysis; Operating Procedures; Training; Contractors; Pre-Startup Safety Review; Mechanical Integrity; Hot Work Permit; Management of Change; Incident Investigation; and Compliance Audits.\n\nD. There have been no incidents in the past five years that would qualify for discussion under the RMP five-year accident history.\n\nE. PWD has trained responders on-site for small releases and relies on the Portland Fire Department and the Cumberland County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) for more extensive releases.\n\nF. PWD has a very strong safety program both at the plant and throughout the organization.  Additional changes planned to improve safety at the plant include the elimination of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.  Withi"
