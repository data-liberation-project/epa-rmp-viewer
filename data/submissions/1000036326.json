The Emergency Action Plan (Plan) is summarized in the Emergency Planning and Response section of Costco Wholesale's PSM/RMP document.  This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1.) To save lives.\r\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n3.) To protect the environment.\r\n4.) To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nCostco maintains a safety committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan will be reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate facility changes.\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale has coordinated emergency response efforts with the local fire department, West Palm Beach Fire Rescue.  In the case of an ammonia-related emergency, it is the policy of Costco Wholesale to evacuate the employees and to allow the responders to respond to the emergency.  The refrigeration contractor will be available for guidance.\r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale utilizes an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling for cross dock operations, cold storage, and air cooling in the Engine Room.  The ammonia system at the Costco Wholesale consists primarily of vessels, compressors, a condenser, evaporators and associated piping.  The majority of the equipment is located inside the engine room.  The system is a closed loop refrigeration system similar to a residential refrigerator.  There are no emissions or planned releases of ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale facility provides cold storage space and a cross docking area for refrigerated items.

Compressors and condensers cycle on and off to comply with system demand during operation.  The ammonia refrigeration system provides cooling for several areas (Cross Dock, Meat Cooler, and the Engine Room. The majority of the system equipment is located in the ammonia Engine Room.  The condensers are mounted on the Engine Room roof, the water diffusion tank is located underground outside the west building entrance, and the evaporators are placed in the cold storage areas with 1 unit in the ammonia engine room for temperature control. \r\n\r\nRISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\n\r\nThe Costco Wholesale ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features.  Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system.  For example, the facility operates in accordance with OSHA's Process Safety Management regulation and EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP).  The facility also maintains a contract with a professional refrigeration service firm to conduct preventative maintenance and any necessary repairs.\r\n\r\nAmmonia detectors are strategically located in the engine room and the cold storage areas.  In case of ammonia detection, visible and audible alarms will activate at the facility and at the computer system.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a power failure, ammonia operations would automatically shut-down (solenoid valves close, compressors shut-down, condenser fans and water pumps shut-down, evaporator fans shut-down, etc.), thereby limiting the possibility of any ammonia releases. \r\n\r\nThe system also incorporates a pressure relief system.  In the event of over-pressurization, vessels will vent to a comm"

This mechanism prevents vessels from rupturing in case they become over pressurized.\r\n\r\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 1997 Uniform Mechanical Code, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines.  In particular, the IIAR Bulletin 110, \"Startup, Inspection, and Maintenance of Ammonia Refrigeration Systems\" is used as a general guide.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\r\n\r\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.\r\n\r\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n\u00bfOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\r\n\u00bfKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\"\r\n\r\nA review of the facility's accident history revealed there have been no RMP reportable accidents as defined above. In addition, there have been no significant releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the last five years (August 2008 - August 2013).  In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release. \r\n \r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\n\r\nCostco Wholesale has an emergency action plan in effect at the facility.
