We have implemented a combination of accident release prevention program and emergency planning program to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public, as well as to protect he environment.  These programs include OSHA\u00bfs Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals Standard (Process Safety Management or PSM) and EPA\u00bfs Risk Management Program (RMP).  In this way, we promote overall plant and worker safety.\n\nII.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nRalphs\u00bfs Riverside Facility operates both a distribution center and a manufacturing plant.  Accordingly, there are two separate and distinct refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia, a regulated substance.  One system provides refrigerated warehousing of perishable foods and contains an ammonia charge of 49,534.  The other system provides refrigeration for manufactured fluid milk and other beverages and contains an ammonia charge of 14,830 pounds.\n\n\nIII.\tGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur RMP/PSM enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Overall, the PSM/RMP prevents accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoids physical property damage.\n\nIV.\tGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur RMP/PSM enables our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydro"

Overall, the PSM/RMP prevent accidental fatalities, injuries, and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur RMP/PSM prevents accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures and practices which govern the individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to an accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nOur RMP/PSM contains the following elements:\n\n-\tProcess Safety Information\n-\tProcess hazard Analysis\n-\tStandard Operating Procedures\n-\tTraining\n-\tMechanical Integrity\n-\tManagement of Change\n-\tPre-Startup Safety Review\n-\tCompliance Audits\n-\tIncident Investigation\n-\tEmployee Participation\n-\tHot Work Permit\n-\tContractor Qualifications\n-\tEmergency Response\n\nV.\tFive-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years there has been one (1) documented accidental release of ammonia from a covered process which resulted in on site injuries.  The release occurred on September 11, 1999, and it resulted in 7 minor to moderate onsite injuries.\n\nVI.\tEmergency Response Program\n\nOur facility has an in-house first responder team that is trained to handle chemical releases and works in cooperation with the City of Riverside Fire Department.  Training on emergency response procedure is provided to maintenance engineers upon hiring and refresher courses are provided annually.  In the event emergency health services are required, trained responders are equipped with basic first aid knowledge and will assist the Fire Department emergency medical personnel..\n\nThe emergency procedures provide directions for the facility occupants on proper notification of agencies, announcement of an emergency and evacuation of the buildings.\n\nVII.\tPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nThe facility is designed and constructed in accordance with the appropriate building and safety codes as well as relevant fire codes.  Any improvements or requested changes to the facility have been addressed prior to startup and wo"
