      "SummaryText": "At its facility in Greenville, Michigan, Federal Mogul manufactures automotive bearings from steel strip to which a lead-tin-copper alloy is sintered prior to forming, machining and plating.  Anhydrous ammonia is used as a source of hydrogen for its sintering process.  The ammonia is stored in an 11,000 gallon pressurized storage tank that is inspected weekly and quarterly.  Vaporized ammonia gas is cracked in a system located inside the plant; hydrogen is captured and used; nitrogen is vented.\n\nFederal Mogul maintains operating procedures and EH&S work instructions that are consistent with ISO 14001.  FM's procedures identify qualified response personnel, describe the action to be taken in the event of an emergency, and address system parameters to be monitored to ensure the integrity of its operations.  These procedures are communicated to all employees and reviewed annually to ensure their applicability and adequacy.  FM also maintains a Process Safety Management program that has been approved by MiOSHA.  \n\nSenior management has documented its commitment to safety and the well-being of the employees working at the plant as well as local residents.  Twin cartridge negative-pressure respirators, suitable for working in ammonia-rich environments, are worn by personnel (in-house or contractors) working on the ammonia transfer system. In the event of a release, members of FM's Emergency Response Team follow evacuation procedures to protect employees and contact local emergency response agencies (police, fire) to alert them of the hazards and steps being taken to minimize diffusion of the gas. All members of the ER team are trained in response procedures and the use of PPE needed during a release, including the use of self-contained breathing equipment.  An annual drill is conducted for all employees on all shifts.\n\nThere have been no reportable releases in the past five years.\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario addressed in the RMP is based on a major rupture of the storage ves"

In this event, liquid under pressure is assumed to flow from the tank, overwhelming the containment structure and vaporizing as it disperses on the ground.  The Alternate Scenario assumes a smaller leak in the storage tank, above the liquid level, which would release ammonia vapor under pressure to the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nA complete review and updating of the plant?s emergency preparedness & response program is in progress and is scheduled for completion by 12/31/05.  The review includes consolidation of the PIP Plan, SPCC Plan, SWPPP, and PSM program for ammonia."
