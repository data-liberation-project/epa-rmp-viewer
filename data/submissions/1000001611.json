KNCA?s management philosophy goals are achieved through the implementation of the KNC EHS&T Management System, by the personal commitments of employees and contractors, and by open communication with employees, customers, neighbors, and regulators.\n\nThe purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to provide information about operations at the facility, programs to prevent accidental chemical releases, emergency response plans in the event of an accidental release, the five-year accident history of the facility and planned changes to improve safety at the plant.\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nKNCA?s Enid Nitrogen Plant produces anhydrous ammonia, urea fertilizer, and urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), which are loaded on truck and railcar for distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is also injected into the main pipeline to be transported to distribution terminals. \n\nThe manufacturing portion of the facility consists of two ammonia units, a urea production unit, and a UAN unit.  Ancillary units include a carbon dioxide pipeline compressor station, an argon separation plant, and a portable ammonium polyphosphate unit that is at the plant for approximately one week twice per year.  The ammonia unit uses natural gas, air, and water to produce ammonia.  Ammonia is used along with carbon dioxide to produce solid urea fertilizer in the urea production unit.  UAN solution is produced by manufacturing urea in liquid form and combining it with liquid ammonium nitrate, which is made by neutralizing nitric acid with ammonia.   \n\nAnhydrous ammonia and chlorine (used in the cooling tower) are "

An RMP-regulated flammable mixture consisting of methane and hydrogen is found in the ammonia production process in amounts greater than threshold quantity.  As this mixture moves through the plant production process, it comes to contain ammonia as well.  The facility is regulated under the Program Level 3 requirements.\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs in place at the facility are part of the high standards striven for by KNC.  These high standards include:\n\nA?    Operating in compliance with required environmental permits and regulations. \nA?    Operating and maintaining the assets in such a manner that unintentional releases are minimized.\nA?    Operating and maintaining assets in such a manner that the small releases associated with normal operation and maintenance will be minimized to the extent possible.\nA?    Correcting non-compliance found by regular audits of the facility.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Enid Nitrogen Plant is operating under the guidelines of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Part of this program has involved identifying and taking steps to avoid potential accidental chemical releases.  A few examples of the prevention features implemented at this facility include:\n\nA?    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply to the process control system by having a backup power generator.\nA?    Minimizing the possibility of an interruption in power supply by having a connection to a secondary power grid.\nA?    Testing of vessels and preventive maintenance through the Mechanical Integrity program helps to ensure that structural failures do not occur in process equipment.\nA?    Minimizing the possibility of a release of ammonia by having emergency "

Reducing the severity of fires and providing a means to control vapor cloud formation with fire monitors located throughout the facility.\nA?    Reducing the risk of overfilling by having level alarms and/or indicators on storage tanks and bullets.\nA?    Implementing procedures for loading/unloading operations that help prevent a truck driver from driving away before the loading arm is properly disconnected.\nA?    Utilizing chlorine sensors for detection of chlorine leaks.\nA?    Loading trucks only when KNC personnel are on site and can monitor activities.\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the last five years, the Enid Nitrogen Plant has experienced three incidents that are reportable under the five-year accident history of the RMP regulation.  One occurred in June 2007 and two occurred in November 2007.  Additional information for each incident is provided in the RMP Data Elements.\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe facility will continue to conduct emergency response preparedness activities and coordinate any emergency response actions necessary for the Enid Nitrogen Plant with the Enid Fire Department, the Garfield County Sheriff, and the Garfield County LEPC.  As appropriate, also involved in emergency response for the facility would be the Oklahoma State Police, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, and St. MaryA?s Regional Medical Center.  The Enid Plant Manager is responsible for coordinating the emergency actions.  A specific Emergency Response Plan for the facility is in place and that plan has been coordinated with local officials.  The Emergency Response Program provides the essential planning for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nCompliance with the RMP Prevention Program forms the framework for continuous safety improvement.  Some of the key components of the safety program are:\n\nA?    The Management of Change provisions ensure that the poten"

The Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) provisions serve as a tool to ensure timely evaluation of potential hazards, thereby leading to continual improvements in safety standards.\nA?    The Mechanical Integrity provisions ensure that process equipment and instrumentation are designed, constructed, installed and maintained to minimize the risk of hazardous releases, thereby serving as an integral part of the safety program.\nA?    Incident Investigation procedures are in place to ensure that corrective measures are taken, if necessary, following an incident.  This ensures that process design, operating equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are evaluated to determine changes needed to prevent recurrence of the incident.\n\nSpecific actions that will be taken in the future to improve the level of safety at the facility include:\n\nA?    Internal and third party compliance audits to ensure that the level of safety protection at the facility is periodically evaluated for improvements.\nA?    An ongoing dialogue with the Garfield County Emergency Management Director or his designate will ensure a constant state of readiness to respond to any potential emergencies, as well as a means to implement improvements as the need develops. \n\nAll interested citizens or community organizations are encouraged to contact the Garfield County Emergency Management Director for the latest information on emergency response for the county.  The facility coordinates its response capabilities and personnel with those of the county on an ongoing basis.\n"
