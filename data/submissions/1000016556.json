Expelling heat caused from altering the ammonia between a liquid and a gas state creates refrigeration in the facility. The refrigeration system consists of a series of compressors, condensers, evaporators, vessels, piping and valves. There is currently 336,993 pounds of ammonia in the refrigeration system throughout the plant. \n\nOur Five Year Accident History \n\nIn the past five years, the facility has not had an accident involving ammonia that resulted in any on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage or that resulted in any deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place. \n\nOur Emergency Response Program \n\nThe facility implements an integrated contingency plan to address all emergency response scenarios. These scenarios include response procedures for various types of chemical releases, fires, floods and other system failures and natural disasters. This plan is reviewed annually and made available to the local fire department and the local emergency planning committee. Each year, the local fire department visits the facility for refresher orientation and emergency preparedness.\n \n\n\nOur Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nNo substantial projects are currently planned. Our procedures are established to promote continuous improvement in our operations through inspection, training and auditing."
