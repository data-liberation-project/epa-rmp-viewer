We use a combination of accidental release prevention and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our associates and the public, as well as the protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *    A description of our facility and our uses of substances that are regulated by EPA's RMP regulation.\n *    A summary of the results of our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases.\n *    An overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n *    A five-year history of accidental releases for chemicals that are regulated by EPA's RMP rule.\n *    An overview of our emergency response program.\n *    An overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and therefore adversely affecting our associates, the public, and the environment.\n *    EPA (RMP) - Required Certifications.\n *    Detailed information (data elements) about our risk management program.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAt the present time, our facility is a for-hire bulk liquid storage facility, NAICS 493190, that stores a variety of chemicals and petrochemicals. Our processes involve the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nToxic\n\nAcrylonitrile         \nVinyl Acetate Monomer    \nAllyl Alcohol        \n\nFlammables\n\nPropylene            \n1,3-Butadiene        \nIsobutane            \nIsoprene            \n1-Butene            \n\n\n\nKEY OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SCENARIOS\n\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the w"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures that limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a regulated toxic chemical, is the failure of a storage tank. The storage quantity in the tank is limited to 95% of the tank capacity by I.T.C. administrative controls.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the development of a .50\" hole in a 8\" dock line. The emergency shutdown system stops the flow in a time period that is less than 10-minutes.\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves the development of a .50\" hole in a 6\" dock line. The emergency shutdown system stops the flow in a time period that is less than 10-minutes.\n\nFor both worst and alterative regulated toxic scenerios the mitigation controls and release mitigations are:\n\n    Containment area. The containment area will hold the entire amount of the dock line.\n    Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated)\n    The storage tank are built to API 650 and are inspected to API 653\n    Fire suppression\n    Trained emergency response personnel\n    Personnel protective equipment (i.e., protective clothing, self-contained breathing apparatus)\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe worst case release scenario for a regulated flammable gas is the failure of a storage tank. The storage quantity in the tank is limited to 95% of the tank capacity by I.T.C. administrative controls.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) - Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nThe alternative release scenario, is the operation of an 8\" relief valve for 10 minutes, resulting in the  release of  product.\n\nFor both worst and alterative regulated flammable scenerios th"

Our management system addresses each key feature of a prevention program including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our associates are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business; and, we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention. \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThere have been no releases of EPA regulated chemicals at I.T.C. in the past five years that have had an adverse impact on the community or our industrial neighbor(s). Nor have there been any incidents that are under the EPA definition.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates all of the various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers"

Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan. \nWe are using this information to help ensure that our emergency response plan and the community emergency response plan address all reasonable contingency cases.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we plan to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nProposed installation of a gas detection system. \nProposed installation of two emergency shutdown valves on the cargo and pipeline pump bypass lines. The tank must come out of service before the valves can be installed.\nProposed installation of emergency shutdown switches outside the storage area for the cargo pumps.\nProposed installation of a audio alarm on the corkin compressor.\nProposed installation of a high level and high/high level alarms on the tanks.\nProposed placing regulated pumps into I.T.C.'s tandem seals program.\nProposed placing regulated pumps into I.T.C.'s check valves program.\nProposed placing the pipelines on our non-destructive program.\nProposed installation of an extension pipe on the knock-out pot.\n\n"
