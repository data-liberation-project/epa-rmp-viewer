Regular audits are conducted to ensure that these programs are in place and functioning well at the Baytown plant.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility?s primary activities encompass manufacturing of sulfuric acid and the regeneration of spent sulfuric acid.  We have 6 regulated substance that could be present at our facility; Ammonia (anhydrous), Carbon Disulfide, Methyl Mercaptan, Butene-1, Propylene, and Ethyl Mercaptan.   Ammonia is used to reduce emissions from the sulfuric acid plant.  Carbon Disulfide, Methyl Mercaptan, Butene-1, Propylene, and Ethyl Mercaptan are parts of  mixtures that are used as feed stocks to recover sulfur to make sulfuric acid.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Rhodia Baytown Plant has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
