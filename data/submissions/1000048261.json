Expansion plans underway will increase the inventory to more than10,000 lbs. of anhydrous ammonia.\r\n\r\nPublication or sharing of OCA portions of RMP materials can be in violation of the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act (PL106-40). \r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\nWe at Morada Produce Co. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.

Actual distances less than .1 mile is recorded as .1 miles. No public receptors are in the distance to toxic endpoint.

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\nMorada Produce  maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.

According to the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration \u00bfThe worst-case situation represents an extremely improbable (and for many facilities impossible) set of circumstances rather than a credible accident scenario. Release quantities and hazard distances derived therefrom for the worst-case scenario should not be used as a basis for emergency response planning.\u00bf\r\nTo evaluate the worst and alternate case scenarios, we have used the EPA\u00bfs RMPComp software.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\r\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from the high-pressure receiver. In this scenario Ammonia (anhydrous) is released from the system.  In typical operation only 10-20% of this amount is present at one time in the receiver. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability, urban location due to trees/orchards in the area providing obstacles and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.  Population estimates for the entire area is included in the study. Actual number affected by a worst case release is only 10% of this amount that would be in the plume footprint. The plume footprint is an oblong area starting at the release point getting the widest \u00bd the distance to the toxic endpoint and then narrowing again.\r\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a"
