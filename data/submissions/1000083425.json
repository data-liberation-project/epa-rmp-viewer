Reducing the impact of our operations on the environment is also a priority. NuStar Energy LP is committed to achieving Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) excellence throughout the organization.\r\nNuStar management has also agreed to correct in a timely manner all hazards identified through self inspections, employee reports, accident investigations, or any other means with interim protection as necessary.\r\nWe will provide the results of self-inspections and accident investigation to our employees upon request.\r\nWe will continuously seek areas for improvement and ways to raise our employees level of awareness regarding all aspects of safety and health.\r\nThe Geneva Terminal was built and put into service in 1953. The facility was built to store and transport propane (RMP regulated substance), refined products and a Liquid Mixture (LM) of the two products. The propane, refined products and the LM are delivered, via a 10 pipeline, to the Geneva Terminal from the NuStar Terminal in McPherson,Kansas. The 6,321,840 lbs. of propane, which exceeds the 10,000 lbs. threshold quantity (TQ) of the OSHA PSM requirements, is stored in, one of sixteen, pressurized bullet tanks. The LM is stored in two pressurized bullet tanks. The propane is removed from the site by either propane trucks that deliver it to various customers, or by one of four pipelines, which consist of two 8 pipelines and two 6 pipelines.\r\nThe Geneva Facility complies with many different regulatory agencies, which include, but not limited to;\r\n - OSHAs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program (1910.119) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\r\n - OSHAs Emergency Action Plan Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.38(c).\r\n - OSHAs HAZWOPER Regulation, 29 CFR 1910.120.\r\n - Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990: U.S. DOT Final Rule for Transportation Related On-Shore Facilities as"
