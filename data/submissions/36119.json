This commitment is demonstrated through implementation of corporate policies and standards.  Policies and standards that have been implemented include The Dow Chemical Company's Standards for Safe Work Permitting, Isolation of Energy Sources, Hot Work, Confined Space Entry, Management of Change - including pre-start up review, and Mechanical Integrity.  In addition to these corporate standards, the Harbor Beach facility has implemented facility specific policies to address specific facility situations.  Process Hazard Analysis is completed using The Dow Chemical Company's Fire and Explosion Index, Chemical Exposure Index, Layers of Protection Analysis (LOPA), and Reactive Chemicals Review process.  The facility also maintains an incident investigation policy that requires that all incidents that result in or could potentially result in release of a regulated substance be investigated, documented and appropriately addressed.  \n\nThe Facility and the Regulated Substances Handled:\nThe Site operates a product manufacturing process that consists of fermentation, product recovery (crystallization, filtration, product drying, and packaging), spent broth processing, and emission control equipment.  The product produced, Spinosad, is an active ingredient for an insect management product.  The manufacturing process utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a raw material and process additive.  The anhydrous ammonia storage tank will hold a maximum inventory of 70,000 lbs., however, tank levels are maintained at or below 80% (56,000 lbs.)                              \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nThe facility currently complies with EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations.  In addition, the facility maintains a Title V Re"

The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with generally accepted good design practices and Engineering standards and maintains process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes, (MSDS sheets, equipment specifications, process descriptions, P&ID's etc).\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis- A Process Hazard Analysis was conducted on 11/23/05.  There were no additional process hazards identified during the 11/23/05 PHA that would trigger resubmittal. There were no action items identified during the 11/23/05 PHA.  All mitigation systems were found to be adequate and sufficient to address existing process safety hazards.\n\nProcedures - The facility maintains written operating procedures for various modes of operation including, startup, shutdown, normal operations, emergency shutdown, and emergency operations.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and are readily accessible to all operators involved in the processes.  On 3/4/09 the normal operating procedure was updated.  This procedure did not contain information for mitigating or managing process safety hazards identified in the PHA.\n\nTraining - The facility has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three years or more frequently as needed.  Minor adjustments were made to the training program but none of the adjustments were related to the PHA.\n\nCompliance Audits - The facility participates in an EH&S auditing process.  Internal EH&S audits are conducted at least once every three years.  Topics audited include RMP/PSM (process safety) as well as personal safety, industrial hygiene, and environmental aspects.

Employees participate in all elements of the RMP rule. For example, employees assist in the development of operation procedures, participate in MOC's, Pre-Start Up Safety Reviews, Process Hazard Analysis, Accident Investigations and Audits, etc.  Employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.   In addition, all employees have access to all information pertinent to environmental, safety, and health aspects of the processes they operate.  This includes information resulting from process hazard analyses.\n\nContractors - The facility follows the Dow AgroSciences purchasing process in selecting a contractor.  This process includes  evaluation of contractor safety performance.  The facility maintains a contractor orientation program and safe work permitting program designed to inform contractors of Site policies, emergency procedures, and potential hazards of the areas in which they work in.  \n\nFive-year Accident History:\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  There have been no accidental releases during this period.\n\nEmergency Response Program:\nThe facility maintains a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes response to medical incidents, environmental releases, fires, weather emergencies, and utility failures.  Procedures for notification of local emergency response agencies and the community are also included in the plan.  The plan is routinely updated to reflect any changes that would require a modified emergency response.  Site employees receive refresher training annually on the Site plan and participate in emergency drills that include local response agencies.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nPlanned changes to improve safety inclu"
