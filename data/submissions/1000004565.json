      "SummaryText": "The Donora Plant of Dyno Nobel Incorporated is an ammonium nitrate  manufacturing facility located near the intersection of Scott Street and Galiffa Drive in the city of Donora, Washington County, Pennsylvania.  The plant is situated on the west bank of the Monongahela River. The site is bounded on the north by Nitrous Oxide Corporation, on the west by Norfolk Southern Railway Company railroad tracks, on the south by Elliott Support Services, and on the east by the Monongahela River. The facility is comprised of administrative/maintenance buildings, an acid plant complex, an ammonia storage complex, and a bulk prill complex all situated on a 31.5 parcel of land.\n\nIt is the policy of Dyno Nobel to conduct its business in a socially responsible manner; to provide a safe and healthful work environment for its employees; to protect the environment; and to preserve corporate assets. Management, at all levels, is responsible and accountable for compliance with this policy. In observing this policy Dyno Nobel will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and corporate guidelines relating to health, safety, and environmental quality; evaluate the impact on safety, health and environment when developing new products, processes, and operating facilities; facilitate material recycling, waste minimization, and energy conservation; and work constructively with government agencies, community organizations and other interested parties in the fulifillment of corprate resposibility.\n\nThe major raw ingredient for the production activities at this facility is anhydrous ammonia, which is also subject to OSHA's PSM regulations. There are 2 covered processes at this facility which involve anhydrous ammonia.\n\n1. Ammonia Storage and Unloading. This process is comprised of the facilities required to receive ammonia into the facility and to store the ammonia for processing to manufacture nitric acid and ammonium nitrate. Ammonia may be received into the facility by either barge or by"

      "SummaryText": "rail car. Low temperature anhydrous ammonia is transported by barge and is unloaded into a low temperature storage tank. The low temperature storage tank has an administrative fill limit of 90% and a dike for passive mitigation. High pressure ammonia is received by tank cars and unloaded into three high pressure storage tanks. An administrative fill limit of 80% exists for the high pressure storage tanks.\n\n2.Ammonia Oxidation Process. Ammonia is process from storage in the ammonia oxidation process to produce nitric acid. Nitric acid is further reacted with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate solution. \n\nThe accidental release prevention program is integrated into the Donora Plant's Process Safety Management Program and the Emergency Response Plan. Employees are annually trained in basic ammonia emergency response procedures.\n\nWe have had one accidental release of ammonia in the last five years. The release consisted of 300 pounds with no off-site injuries and 4 off-site evacuations as a precautionary measure.\n\nThe emergency response program includes a written Emergency Response Plan, employee training programs, off site emergency response, public and private communication procedures, and scheduled emergency response drills. The emergency response program undergoes a continuous improvement process, and is subject to annual internal auditing.\n\nEach year the Donora Plant conducts a comprehensive audit of the entire safety program. The safety program is modeled after the Det Norske Veritas International Safety Rating System. The audit identifies problem areas within the system, which serves as the basis for improving safety at the Donora Plant."
