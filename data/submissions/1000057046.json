This document has been prepared to consider all the process units as RMP Program 3 processes.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe El Dorado, Kansas refinery has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. The goal is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, refinery personnel have been trained on the proper response to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nHolly Energy Partners (HEP) owns and operates two process units within the El Dorado facility.  Of the two units, only the Naphtha Fractionation Unit is an EPA RMP covered process.  Regulated flammable substances and toxic substances used or produced on site and are listed in information for process.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE/CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\n\n\nThe facility is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation and the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. Therefore, there is a management system in place to address each element and to implement the accident prevention program. A brief discussion follows for each of these areas. Employee participation is encouraged in the development, review and application of procedures and information regarding the various PSM and RMP elements. Some of the more significant opportunities for active participation are Process Hazard Analysis studies, Management of Change, Pre-Startup Safety Reviews, Incident Investigation, Operating Procedures and Training.\n\n\n\nDocumentation is an important aspect in the operation of a petroleum refine"

The information regarding chemicals, process chemistry and refinery equipment is extensive and is continuously being verified and updated.\n\n\n\nIdentifying potential hazards is a critical element of the safety process at El Dorado. Process Hazard Analysis studies have been performed on all covered processes at the refinery and are revalidated on a 5 year schedule. Hazard analysis is also performed on changes through the Management of Change process. Recommendations resulting from the studies are addressed and actions taken to address the recommendations are documented.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures have been developed to provide instructions for safely operating the process units. These procedures serve as a consistent basis for training new operators and for reference by experienced operators. The procedures are periodically reviewed, are considered in the management of change process and are annually certified as current and accurate. \n\n\n\nOperator Training is conducted in coordination with the operating procedures. New employees receive foundational training on refinery operations and unit specific training. All operators receive refresher training to ensure operating skills and knowledge are maintained and enhanced. Training requirements are also considered when changes are made to the individual units.\n\n\n\nThe facility uses Contractors to supplement its workforce and because this work is often on or near process equipment, there are specific requirements for contractors. Contractor safety programs, performance and training are evaluated prior to allowing them to perform work in the refinery. The contractors are made aware of refinery safety rules and evacuation plans and are informed of potential hazards related to their work. Contractor activities are monitored while in the refinery to ensure they are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nThe facilty reviews process changes through the"

The review and authorization process makes provisions for reviewing the change from several aspects, including the potential hazards, safety and health effects, procedural updates and training requirements. The pre-startup safety review provides a final safety review of the change prior to startup.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity programs are necessary to provide for the on-going integrity of process equipment and instrumentation. Experienced employees and qualified contractors perform maintenance work on the equipment and instrumentation. Inspection and tests are performed in accordance with plant and industry standards and quality assurance is incorporated in new construction and maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigations are valuable learning tools in determining facts regarding incidents and in developing corrective actions to prevent recurrence. The refinery has personnel  trained in incident investigation techniques and they are assigned as required to form teams, investigate incidents and report on the findings. The report and any recommendations are then acted on to improve the safety of the unit and the facility. \n\n \n\nSafe Work Practices at El Dorado are long-standing practices to help ensure operations and maintenance activities are performed safely. These are periodically reviewed and updated.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits have been conducted at El Dorado every three years since completion of the units  and are viewed as a way of evaluating the various elements of the safety programs and making improvements as necessary.\n\n\n\nCHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\n\n\nThe processes at the facility have hazards that must be managed for continued safe operation. The accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all EPA RMP covered process at the El Dorado facility.

In addition to the accident prevention program activities, the facility has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, quickly detect a release and reduce the consequences or mitigate the consequences of a release.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\n\n\nThere has been no accident with the naphtha fractionation unit involving releases from covered processes that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe emergency response plan for facility  is documented in the El Dorado Emergency Response Plan and in the Emergency Reference Manual. These form an organizational plan designed to manage an emergency situation by setting up effective communications, establishing a management plan, coordinating necessary resources and allowing coordination with any municipal/state/federal emergency response agency that may respond to an emergency at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe El Dorado Refinery emergency response organization starts with members of the Safety Department and the Emergency Response Team (ERT). Fire\\Safety Specialists are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and serve as the Operations Chief in an incident. They are trained Industrial Fire Officers and Emergency Medical Technicians. They are rapidly supplemented by volunteer members of the Emergency Response Team that are on each shift. They may be further supplemented by calling out additional members of the ERT and members of the management team. \n\n\n\nThe emergency response team members have a number of skills and training including rescue operations, emergency medical treatment, fire suppression and hazardous material response.

Areas of focus include:\n\n\n\n- Operation Excellence with continuing improvement in operating discipline, procedures/training, and process monitoring;\n\n- Mechanical Integrity with finishing the retro-PMI programs, completing implementation of the RBMI program, and improvements in the PSV program management; and \n\n- The Process Safety group efforts will include updating and implementing procedures in process hazard analysis, management of change, and facility siting evaluation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
