The facility is located at 1401 Stauffer Road in Palm, PA.  \r\n\r\nThe following regulated RMP-regulated substances and maximum intended inventories are maintained onsite:\r\n-\tPropane: 127,867 lbs\r\n-\tIsobutane [Propane, 2-methyl]: 85,582 lbs\r\n-\t1-Butene: 44,883 lbs\r\n-\tMethane: 32,663 lbs\r\n-\tPropylene [1-Propene]: 238,040 lbs\r\n-\tButane: 85,120 lbs\r\n-\tEthylene [Ethene]: 69,299 lbs\r\n-\tIsopentane [Butane, 2-methyl-]: 47,840 lbs\r\n-\tPentane: 28,903 lbs\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\r\n\r\nMatheson Tri-Gas has developed a Process Safety Management and Risk Management Program to manage the handling of the regulated substances. The program includes but is not limited to the following elements:\r\n\r\n1) Safety information that describes the chemical hazards"

Most cylinders/storage tanks are equipped with a fusible relief plug which protects the equipment from overpressurization and rupture.  Detectors are installed where the cylinders are stored to warn personnel of a leak.  The cylinders are inspected upon delivery, and any cylinders with damage are rejected and returned to the supplier.  The cylinders are also inspected for leaks and proper labeling.  All other cylinder maintenance is performed by the chemical supply vendor.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents onsite that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no releases of regulated substances that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantities for each of the chemicals.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nMatheson Tri-Gas has developed an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the purpose of protecting employees and the surrounding community.  The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2)"

      "SummaryText": "dealing with chemical releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and outside emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for chemical exposure.  Employees perform evacuation drills and receive refresher training on the EAP.  In the event of a chemical release, the facility emergency coordinators will assess the situation and contact the fire department for assistance.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the regulated processes, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Matheson Tri-Gas has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements."
