Our training program includes initial training as well as refresher training.\n\nMaintenance\nIn accordance with Section 68.56 of the RMP rule, we maintain our process equipment using an inspection and testing program and we ensure that our equipment is designed and installed correctly so that it operates properly.\n\nCompliance Audits\nIn accordance with Section 68.58 of the RMP rule, we conduct compliance audits to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the RMP rule. \n\nIncident Investigations\nIn accordance with Section 68.60 of the RMP rule, we perform incident investigations to help ensure that all incidents are thoroughly investigated, root causes are identified and corrected, and relevant findings are communicated throughout our organization to help prevent a recurrence. \n\nFive-year Accident History\nOn 9/29/2023, after pumping cyclohexylamine from a tote to the bulk tank, the hose was disconnected from the stinger and the contractor felt some drips fall on their arm. The contractor was wearing appropriate PPE The affected area was rinsed under a safety shower immediately and plant management was notified. The process for pulling the hose from the tote has been investigated and changed.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nChemTreat is included in the Jefferson County Emergency Planning Commission community emergency response plan.

The requirements to manage the risks associated with any new hazardous materials are determined and all necessary configuration changes, program procedure updates and employee training are completed prior to introduction of the new material into the process.\n \nHazard Review\nIn accordance with Section 68.50 of the RMP rule, we use hazard reviews to systematically identify, evaluate, and control process hazards.

All plant configuration, operations and emergency response practices are managed using company standard operating procedures which are a part of the Company Management Systems described below.\n\nQuality System (QS)\nStandard operating procedures for all production and related services are managed using an ISO 9000 certified Quality System. \n \nEnvironmental Management System (EMS)\nAll environmental program procedures are included in an Environmental Management System that is certified under the ISO 14001 Standard. The RMP is a program procedure under the EMS.\n \nHealth and Safety Management System (HSMS)\nAll Health and Safety written programs are already installed and controlled using the Management Systems same processes as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 programs.\n\nPolicy\nChemTreat is well aware that our business requires the management of certain hazardous chemicals, which if not properly controlled, introduce increased potential for harm to employees, the community and the environment. Accordingly, we have established systematic procedures to evaluate potential risks, establish procedures to manage those risks on a priority basis, and review and update our programs as conditions or capabilities change. ChemTreat is committed to compliance with all regulatory and other requirements and uses a formal review process including internal and external auditing and inspection to assure the continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of all compliance programs. \n\nFacility And Regulated Substances\nChemTreat, Inc. plant in Nederland, Texas is a small blending facility of industrial water treatment chemicals for use in boilers, cooling s"
