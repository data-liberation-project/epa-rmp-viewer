This update will serve as the facility's five-year update as required in 40 CFR Part 68.190.\n\n\n\nAt General Chemical's Syracuse Works, one listed chemical, Anhydrous Ammonia, is managed on-site in quantities greater than the threshold quantity under the program level 3 criteria (according to applicability thresholds listed in 40 CFR Part 68.10). No chemicals are managed on-site under program level 1 or program level 2 criteria.\n\n\n\nThis RMP executive summary describes Syracuse Work's risk management program which includes a release prevention program and an emergency response program.  The release prevention and emergency response programs at this site were developed based on requirements from the CAA's Accidental Release Prevention Provisions as well as OSHA's Process Safety Management standard (29 CFR 1910.119). \n\n\n\n* Section 1.0 - Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n* Section 2.0 - Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances \n\n* Section 3.0 - General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n* Section 4.0 - Five Year Accident History\n\n* Section 5.0 - Emergency Response Program \n\n* Section 6.0 - Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\n1.0  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nGeneral Chemical LLC recognizes that the responsible management of health, safety and the environment in and around its facilities is a key element in its successful business plan.

Achieving responsible health, safety and environmental management will be accomplished by: operating our facilities safely and prudently; assessing and mitigating environmental risks; seeking ways to minimize or reuse wastes; and complying fully with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent and/or mitigate foreseeable releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n\n2.0  Description of Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nGeneral Chemical's Syracuse Works manufactures Sodium Nitrite.  The process of producing Sodium Nitrite requires Anhydrous Ammonia to be used as a raw material. Sodium Nitrite has a broad range of applications.  For example, it is used as a corrosion inhibitor, and a meat-curing agent.  It is also used in the production of textile dyes, rubber compounds, and charcoal briquettes.\n\n \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received by the Syracuse facility as a pressurized liquid in rail cars and tank trucks and is unloaded into two storage tanks.\n\n\n\n3.0  General Accidental Release Prevention Programs and Chemical - Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nGeneral Chemical maintains a comprehensive release prevention program designed to prevent accidental releases and foster safe operations of our processes.  The accidental release prevention program implemented at Syracuse Works includes procedures and practices which address each of the required elements of the risk management program including:\n\n\n\n* Process Safety Information - Information relating to the hazards of the chemical(s), process technology and equipment information is maintained to ensure proper operation.  This information includes: P&IDs, Safety Data Sheets, equipment specifications, operating limits, etc.  \n\n\n\n* Mechanical Integrity - Equipment is routinely inspected and maintenance activities are managed in a manner to maintain the integrity of the equipment.

A third party is engaged to assist General Chemical with the completion of Process Hazard Analysis.  \n\n\n\n* Standard Operating Procedures - Detailed procedures are in place identifying actions necessary for multiple phases of operation, operating limits and safety considerations.\n\n\n\n* Employee Participation - Employees at multiple levels are involved in key roles of the release prevention program.  Employees may be involved in incident investigations, Process Hazard Analysis, SOP updating, etc.  \n\n\n\n* Training - Employees are trained to facilitate proper operation of the plant.  Instruction takes place in the classroom as well as on the job.  Safety training is conducted annually or at other appropriate intervals.  \n\n\n\n* Management of Change - Process parameters are maintained through a management of change system which documents the changes as well as evaluates changes for safety.\n\n\n\n* Pre-startup Safety Review - Significant changes to affected processes are evaluated in order to verify that the proper procedures for engineering, operations, emergency response and overall safety are addressed prior to start-up.\n\n\n\n* Incident Investigation - All incidents involving releases are investigated to identify root cause and corrective actions to prevent re-occurrence.\n\n\n\n* Safe Works Practices - Standard safety practices are in place to help promote worker safety including lockout/tagout procedures, control of entry into process areas, line breaking procedures, confined space entry procedures and hot work procedures.\n\n\n\n* Contractor Safety - Contractors are evaluated and trained prior to performing work on affected processes to reduce the potential "
