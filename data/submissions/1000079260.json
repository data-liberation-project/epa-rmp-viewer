This nonwoven manufacturing process has been in continuous operation since January, 1970. The process was originally developed by Monsanto Company in the late '60s and operated by Monsanto until sold to James River Corporation in September, 1985. Since 1985, the ownership of the nylon nonwoven manufacturing operation changed through several corporate owners, and then became privately held as CEREX Advanced Fabrics (CEREX) in 1994. The covered process includes a single piping system that continuously delivers Anhydrous Hydrogen Chloride from one of three tube trailers to a single injection point where the material is mixed and substantially diluted for use as a process aid to bond nylon fibers to form a fabric. The covered process also includes a vent system used to evacuate and purge the process piping to a \"drowning jet\" whereby the material is diluted and neutralized.\r\n\r\nA.

In this scenario, all tubes are open to accommodate process requirements, and the scenario response dictates manually closing each tube isolation valve by our Emergency Response Team. CEREX uses one tube trailer every 2-3 weeks, and utilizes a \"drop and swap\" protocol to ensure continual supply to the process. Three unloading spots are\r\nin place; one for the on-line trailer, one for the leaving and one for the arriving trailer. Reorders occur when the Tube trailer is near empty (approximately 3,000 pounds). This protocol limits the maximum amount of aHCl on site at any one time to approximately 38,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nC. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention program:\r\nThe details of these programs are embodied in the documents listed in paragraph (A). In summary, CEREX has implemented systems to prevent an accidental aHCl release that include the following:\r\n    Closed circuit monitoring of the tube trailer unloading area with multi-point monitoring in the facility.\r\n    Emergency response systems that are designed to detect a minor leak (before it becomes a major release) and provide the means to mitigate the impact of a release on the surrounding community. These emergency response systems and procedures include:\r\n   An aHCl multi-point Draeger vapor detection and alarm system that surrounds the tube trailer and process piping with sensors calibrated to trigger an alarm in the event of a leak\r\n   Redundant rupture disk and pressure relief valve in the supply pipe system. The relief exhaust system conveys gas to a \"drowning system\" to neutralize any escaping gases\r\n    Remote activated \"fail-close\" emergency block valves located at the tube trailer connection point. When activated, this system will also simultaneously close downstream valves that supply aHCl to the process.\r\n   Cerex alarm systems are integral"
