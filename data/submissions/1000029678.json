      "SummaryText": "Rich Products Corporation - Morristown I Facility produces bakery products which are frozen for shipment by using an ammonia refrigeration system (system).  The system contains approximately 13,500 pounds of anhydrous ammonia which is liquified under pressure.\n  \nRich Products Corporation - Morristown I Facility endeavors to eliminate accidents and health hazards to Associates, customers, and the community by having procedures to provide Associates educational training, safe working conditions, and the means to increase awareness of potential dangers both on and off the job.  Rich Products Corporation - Morristown I Facility's objective is to prevent unwanted releases of ammonia that could potentially expose Associates and others to serious hazards.  An effective program requires a systematic approach to evaluating the entire system.  Workplace and process safety are major concerns to management and Associates alike.  The prevention and mitigation of unwanted releases of ammonia that could expose Associates and the community to serious hazards is of primary concern.   \n\nRich Products Corporation - Morristown I Facility has developed this program in accordance with OSHA Title 29 CFR 1910.119, and the USEPA Title 40 CFR Part 68.  The program is designed to inform all Associates of the hazards of ammonia, procedures for the safe use of ammonia, and the steps taken for the safety of Associates in the event of a release or spill (i.e., emergency response plan, management of change procedures, preventative maintenance program, associate training, etc.).  \n\nRich Products Corporation - Morristown I Facility has not had an accidental release over the last five years.\n\nRich Products Corporation - Morristown I Facility has an emergency response program written to comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 (n), OSHA 29 CFR 1910.38, and USEPA 40 CFR 68.95.  These regulations establish the parameters to be included in the emergency response plan."
