      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nWe have adopted this Program in order to implement 40 C.F.R. 68, the federal requirements regulating Risk Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals.\n\nThis Program will help prevent the occurrence of, or minimize the consequences of, catastrophic releases by stating our policies and guidelines for the management of process hazards in start-up, operation, inspection, maintenance and the other matters addressed in the federal standard.\n\nOur Program calls for maximum employee participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provisions of the federal standard.  We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to be developed under that standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe City of Greenville believes that preventative maintenance is the key to minimizing the potential for accidental releases.  Standard Operating Guidelines (SOGs) have been reviewed and revised to enable the employees to perform their work in a safe and efficient manner.\n\nThe City of Greenville has taken steps to train the operators, supervisors, maintenance crews, and fire department to be first responders to a release.  The training included three days of classroom and hands on training on the proper use of emergency response equipment and guidelines.  The course followed the guidelines stated in OSHA 1910.120.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Water Treatment Plant (WTP) utilizes chlorine and ammonia (anhydrous) for disinfection of the treated water.  However, the maximum inventory of anhydrous ammonia maintained at the WTP is approximately 900 gallons or approximately 5,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory and threshold quantity for anhydrous ammonia"
