      "SummaryText": "LaBrea Bakery operates a bakery facility near Swedesboro, NJ. At this facility, we manufacture bread products to be distributed to stores, restaurants and other customers.\n\nLike most bakery facilities, we use anhydrous ammonia in our refrigeration system. Ammonia is the best refrigerant available for our use.  Because of its moderate toxicity and slight flammability, ammonia is considered a hazardous material.\n\nLaBrea Bakery is committed to maintaining a safe manufacturing operation for our employees and the surrounding community. Our refrigeration system obeys our local building and fire codes, as well as industry-consensus codes and standards where appropriate.  In accordance with the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (29 CFR 1910.119), Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 68) and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJAC 7:31) regulations, this facility has prepared a NJ-TCPA/ EPA-RMP Program, as well as performed air dispersion modeling and off-site consequence analysis.\n\nOur priority is to prevent accidental releases of hazardous materials instead of merely responding to problems.  Our TCPA/RMP program includes elements addressing:\n- Employee Participation: We involve our employees at all appropriate points in our program.\n- Process Safety Information: We maintain information relating to the safety of ammonia and the refrigeration system design so that our employees are fully informed.\n- Process Hazards Analysis: We conduct detailed studies of our refrigeration system to identify the important hazards and safeguards.\n- Operating Procedures: We provide written operating procedures to help our staff stay within the safe operating limits of the refrigeration equipment.\n- Mechanical Integrity (Maintenance and Quality Control): We have established a comprehensive program of inspections and preventive maintenance to keep mechanical failures from occurring.\n- Training: We train our mechanics in safe operation and maintenance of the"

      "SummaryText": " refrigeration system.\n- Management of Change: Alterations to the refrigeration system are screened to verify that they are within the original safe design limits.\n- Pre-Startup Safety Review: We conduct a formal safety review before startup to ensure that the new equipment has been designed and installed properly.\n- Contractors: We carefully screen contractors who work on our property to ensure that they have a safe work record.\n- Hot Work Permits: We strictly control welding and other work that could start a fire near the ammonia equipment.\n- Emergency Response: We coordinate our response to emergencies with the Logan Township Fire Department and the Gloucester County LEPC.\n- Incident Investigation: After an incident, we investigate to determine the causes and any suitable actions to address them.\n- Compliance Audits: Every year, we examine the safety program in detail to identify areas for improvement.\n- Management System: An overall management system monitors the ongoing progress of safety items.\n\nWe used the EPA's ammonia refrigeration guidance documents to estimate hazard levels.  (See the Risk Management Plan, available from the Environmental Protection Agency, for details on the offsite impacts; due to National Security concerns, the U.S. Government has advised the regulated community not to disclose the actual numerical data in this Executive Summary.)\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of ammonia meeting the criteria to be included in the five-year accident history in the past five years.\n\nThrough our TCPA/RMP program, LaBrea Bakery always looks for possible ammonia refrigeration system changes to improve safety in our facility."
