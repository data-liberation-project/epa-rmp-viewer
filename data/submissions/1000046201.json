Only the Dyal water plant has quantities of a regulated hazardous chemical, chlorine, above the EPA threshold.  The City has a unified Risk Management Program which applies to each plant.  Only the Dyal Water Treatment Plant operations and policies are presented in this Plan.\r\n\r\n1.1.\tACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION/EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES     (A)\r\nThe City of Cocoa Water Treatment Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.  The plant prevention program complies with all applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR-68 Prevention Program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\r\n\r\n1.2.\tMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (A) (1)\r\nThe City of Cocoa has a management system in place which is lead by the City Manager.  The City Utilities Director oversees the implementation and on-going use of the RMP elements.  The Dyal Water Treatment Plant Superintendant oversees the daily operation.  An organizational chart defining the lines of authority and responsible staff is included in the plants RMP Process Safety Information.

The 62 acre site is located in an area boarded by SR 250 on the east, South Taylor Creek Rd on the west and private property on the north.\r\nThe Plant includes a separate chlorine storage building and adjacent control room plus injection feed distribution system that is contained in a separate process room as well as at various injector points' (cabinets).\r\nThe boundaries of the chlorine system subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine Storage Room, Feed Control Room, associated vent makeup, exhaust systems, chlorine scrubber and chlorine injection cabinets at various injection points.

The chlorine is received, stored and distributed to water treatment process control systems. \r\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical.  It is an irritant and it is corrosive.  Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2.  It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.  It has a 1 ppm OSHA ceiling Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and a NFPA health rating of 4, severe; with immediate and delayed health hazards.  Chlorine is not a carcinogen.\r\nThe maximum threshold quantity stored on site is 48 one ton containers.  This equals 96,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n2.\tHAZARD ASSESSMENT\r\nA hazard assessment was performed to determine the effects a release would have on the public. For chlorine, the distance to a set endpoint concentration of the gas would travel must be determined.  In addition, an estimate of the population that could be affected by a release of chlorine was determined, and sensitive receptors such as hospitals, schools, and nursing homes were identified. The hazard assessment considers two release scenarios-a \"worst case\" and an \"alternative case\" and also compiles the five-year accident history for the WTP chlorine system.\r\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios.  The first is a \"worst case release\".  The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario\".\r\nAtmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\"  The EPA specified endpoint for chlorine is .0087 mg/l which equals Three ppm.

These include:\r\n3.2.2.\tSpecific procedures for the management of the chlorine process. \r\nCompletion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified chlorine system.   \r\nSpecific emergency response procedures for chlorine releases as outlined below under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures. See the Emergency Response Program book. \r\nSpecific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine is conducted annually. \r\nFinally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the chlorine system.\r\n3.2.3.\tFacility Design\r\nThe chlorine storage area is housed in a closed building.  Its doors are closed and locked requiring an entry key. The plant and support equipment of the chlorine storage building and adjacent control room meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The storage and control building room is equipped with forced ventilation system.  There is a chlorine area monitor inside the storage building.  If chlorine is detected, the monitor alarms and shuts down the forced air ventilation system.  It also starts the building chlorine vent fume scrubber.  The scrubber is capable of neutralizing over 2000 pounds of chlorine.  The control room also has a chlorine monitor.  Both monitors alarm in their local area as well as in the water plant control room. \r\n3.2.4.\tEquipment Design\r\nThere are two types of"

Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including: fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments.  Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City water plant.\r\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine spills (releases).  The plan includes training of all chlorine-area operators. The primary response team includes the Orange County Fire and Rescue, and county Haz Mat Teams.  All of these respond to any severe chlorine leak situation.  Actions include catastrophic, severe, and moderate leaks.  A Chlorine \"B\" Leak Repair Kit is maintained at the chlorine storage area to aid in stopping leaks.  Public notification is facilitated through the County Police and Sheriff's Office, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\r\n\r\n6.\tPERSONNEL (F) (1)\r\nPersonnel are the key resource of the City of Cocoa's prevention program.
