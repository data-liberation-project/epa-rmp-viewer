The Carbon Dioxide is purified, compressed and refrigerated into\r\nliquid form and the liquid Carbon dioxide is stored under pressure as a refrigerated liquid. The\r\nfacility also manufactures and processes various forms of solid Carbon Dioxide (dry ice). Ammonia\r\nis used as the refrigerant in a closed loop Ammonia refrigeration system located on the facility. An\r\nammonia receiver stores the Ammonia refrigerant in addition to various heat exchangers,\r\ncompressors, condensers and connecting piping and valves.\r\nOur worst case scenario for ammonia system is a failure of the ammonia receiver resulting in the\r\nrelease of ammonia.The quantity of the release is estimated to be 17,850lb of ammonia over a 10\r\nminute period of time with most stable of atmospheric conditions which minimizes dispersion of a\r\nrelease and thus the worst case of quantity released and worst case due to atmospheric conditions.\r\nThe calculated toxic endpoint of which the concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 2.6\r\nmiles. These calculations were based on the EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for\r\nAmmonia Refrigeration. Public receptors identified within 2.6 miles of the facility include\r\nresidences, schools and commercial/industrial areas. There is an estimated population of 12,073 that\r\ncould be affected by the worst case scenario.\r\nAn alternate release scenario was also calculated using EPA guidelines. A leak from a pipe, pump or\r\nvessel was assumed to create a release rate of 200lb per minute. The atmospheric condition are\r\nassumed to be more typical of the area and the toxic endpoint of which the ammonia concentration\r\nis calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 0.3 miles. Again, calculations were based on the\r\nEPA's Risk Management Guidelines fro Ammonia Refrigeration. Public receptors within 0.3 miles\r\nof the facility include  commercial/industrial"
