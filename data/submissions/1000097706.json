Facility accidental release and emergency response policy.\n\n\n\nThe management and employees of Gold Star FS Inc. are committed to the \n\nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release \n\nshould occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Coleta Fire Department, \n\nWhiteside County Local Emergency Planning Committee or other authorities, to mitigate any \n\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n\n\n2. The stationary source and the regulated substances handled.\n\n\n\nThe primary activity at the facility, which is located at 24909 Pilgrim Road  Sterling,IL.61081, is the storage \n\nand blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, \n\nand distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The storage and \n\nhandling system consists of one 30,000 gallon storage tank, loading risers, \n\nassociated plumbing and nurse tanks.  Access to the site is restricted to authorized \n\nfacility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored would be 230,000\n\npounds, this includes the amount of anhydrous ammonia that could be stored in nurse \n\ntanks.\n\n\n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage \n\ntank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released \n\nwould be 140,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank  as limited by design standards.  \n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release \n\nfrom a break in a transfer hose.  Emergency shutdown procedures, which include the \n\nclosing of tank valves, was the only active mitigation considered to limit the amount of \n\nproduct released. This release has the possibility of extending beyond the facility\n\nb"

The accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable \n\nstate codes and regulations.  This facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety \n\nRequirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by \n\nThe American National Standards Institute, Inc. as adopted by state regulation and the \n\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR \n\n1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  Compliance with these \n\nregulations and on-going training of our employees make up our accident release prevention \n\nprogram.  \n\n\n\n5. Five year accident history.   \n\n\n\n There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that:\n\n- have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor\n\n- to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, shelter in \n\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6. The emergency response program.\n\n\n\nThe facility has:\n\n- a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n- provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-\n\nknow information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving anhydrous ammonia, it is our policy to notify the \n\nColeta Fire Department and Whiteside County LEPC and request that they respond \n\nto the emergency.  Our emergency action plans have been coordinated with both the fire \n\ndepartment and LEPC.\n\n\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.  \n\n\n\n Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are \n\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no specific safety \n\nrecommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n\nNote: This plant is manned by one full-time employee for approx. one month in the spring\n\nand one mon"
