      "SummaryText": "\nFacility Information\nThis five year update of the Risk Management (Plan RMP submit) covers several areas that were in need of updating.  The basic mission of the facility remains the same, which is to provide both wholesale and retail products to the agricultural end user.   This operation continues to supply ammonia in both anhydrous and aqua states to the end user for agricultural soil fertilization means.  These products are loaded at the facility and delivered to the field for application.  All personal information, addresses, and telephone numbers were rechecked for applicability.\nFive Year Accident History\nThere have been no reportable spills or releases in the last five years, and no injuries or illnesses that were caused by ammonia products.\nEmergency Response and Accident Prevention Program\nThe facility continues to be committed to following all applicable safety and reporting regulations for the storage and transport of ammonia products.  There is an emergency plan in place covering response to releases, and it is presented in annual emergency response training for all involved personnel.  \nWorst and Alternate Case Scenarios\nBoth scenarios were evaluated and remodeled using RMP comp or Aloha where the older models were deemed outdated.  The results were updated in the RMP document, and the appropriate mapping from Landview 6 was utilized to estimate the population changes within the vulnerability zones.\nPlanned changes\nThere are no planned changes to the structure of the storage and loading operations as they are a uniquely simple operation, and have not changed since the last update.    A revised RMP training course is planned by the end of 2009.  In addition some improved inspection and maintenance forms have been included in the five year package for the facilities."
