The process is regulated by EPA 40 CFR Part 68.  We have registered the facility as an RMP Program Level 2 facility.\n\nThe facility receives and distributes butane LPG.  The facility consists of pressure regulation, flow control and flow metering equipment, a truck loading dock and associated piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.  The facility is a wholesale product distribution terminal for butane LPG.    \n\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as havin"

The program provides planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations.  The plan is coordinated with the Matagorda County LEPC and appropriate community emergency responders\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, local Enterprise personnel are trained to sound the alarm, shut off the source from a safe location and contact 9-1-1 and secure the area.  The 9-1-1 system is used to notify the local Police and Fire Departments.  \n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nEnterprise takes a systematic, protective approach to preventing accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  The accident prevention program implemented at Markham Station addresses each of the key features of a successful prevention program for a Program 2 facility, including:\n\n* Process safety information\n* Hazard review\n* Operating procedures\n* Training\n* Maintenance \n* Compliance audits\n* Incident investigation\n\nOperations personnel make regular inspections of the equipment and processes they operate.  If something out of the ordinary is found, it is reported to management in order to expediently resolve any problems.\n\nThe engineering and administrative controls in place have been established to reduce the risk of an accidental release of identified hazards.
