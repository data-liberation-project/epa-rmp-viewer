The probability of the worst case catastrophic event evaluated in this report is extremely remote. The worst case scenario is far less probable than natural catastrophes that could produce much more severe and extensive damage and injury. A consideration of the release scenarios has been incorporated into Energy Transfer's notification and emergency response planning. Energy Transfer also considered the impact of a more likely loss of containment. \r\n\r\nEnergy Transfer has not had any covered process incidents in the past five years. Energy Transfer has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Energy Transfer has active operating, maintenance, training and inspection procedures. Energy Transfer provides annual emergency response training to its employees. Energy Transfer's management is committed to the following:\r\n- Preventing accidents;\r\n- Continuing to proactively seek out improvements to process safety;\r\n- Training employees in correct response procedures in the event of an accident;\r\n- Participating in community emergency preparedness;\r\n- Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\r\n- Being a good corporate citizen in Butler County.\r\n\r\nWith these objectives in mind, the Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with this Plant. Most important, Energy Transfer stresses our commitment to ensuring a safe operation for our employees, our visitors, and our community."

      "SummaryText": "The Energy Transfer Galaxy Gas Plant located in Parker, Pennsylvania is a natural gas compressor station.  This facility receives and processes liquid petroleum gases (LPGs) and delivers them to the gathering pipeline.\r\n \r\nTwo requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the Galaxy Gas Plant:\r\n\r\n1.  Purpose and General Duty Clause - The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Energy Transfer is committed to ensuring the safe operation of the Galaxy Gas Plant, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Energy Transfer, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department and Butler County Emergency Services.\r\n\r\n2.  Risk Management Plan - The primary function of the Galaxy Gas Plant is to function as a compression station for LPGs.  Due to the flammable effects associated with LPGs, it is necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to employee health, and to minimize the threat and impact to nearby members of the community.  Energy Transfer's Galaxy Gas Plant is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety and health.  Safety at the facility depends on the manner in which LPG is handled as well as the various safety devices incorporated into the design of the process.  Furthermore, comprehensive training is provided to employees and contractors which reinforces the safety policies and procedures of the facility. Programs have been established to help prevent any accidental releases and to train personnel for emerge"
