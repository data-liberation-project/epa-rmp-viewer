It includes required actions by plant employees as well as required notification and coordination with local responders and agencies. All employees are trained in the execution of the Emergency Response Plan and drills are conducted annually.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Stationary Source and Regulated substances:\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Paradis Fractionator processes a y-grade natural gas liquid into pure ethane, propane, iso-butane, butane, and natural gasoline. The raw material is received by pipeline, trucks, and railcar. The finished products are delivered to pipelines, truck loading racks and railcar loading racks.\t\nThe facility is also regulated for Methy Mercaptan which is used as an odorize for finished propane. Methyl Mercaptan is stored in two tanks. For each rail load of propane, a pot of the substance is taken manually from the storage tank and added to the railcar to odorize the shipment.  \t\t\t\t\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe Paradis Fractionator has implemented all the elements of a Program 3 Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all the elements of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.

Emergency Response Program Information:\nParadis Fractionator maintains a written emergency response program to protect employees, contractors, public and the environment from hazards associated with accidental releases of regulated substances. The program consists of procedures for responding to releases of regulated substances, including the possibility of associated fires or explosions. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in these procedures annually to perform emergency response duties.  The program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the gas plant processes.
