      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nChlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water. The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of water borne disease in drinking water.  There are two methods of chlorination, breakpoint chlorination and chloramination. The breakpoint chlorination process consists of adding enough chlorine to the water to satisfy the chlorine demand so that free available chlorine residual can be measured.  Chloramination is the process of adding chlorine and ammonia to water, which produces a mono-chloramine residual.  The chloramination process lowers the trihalomethane levels in the finished water.\n\nThe Miami-Dade Water & Sewer Department (MDWASD) John E. Preston Water Treatment Plant (WTP) uses chlorine and ammonia for disinfecting and lowering the trihalomethane levels in the finished drinking water to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine and ammonia can create hazardous situations.  The John E. Preston WTP takes safety obligations in storing and using all chemicals, including ammonia as seriously as it takes care in providing safe drinking water.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine and ammonia handling processes are subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program Rule.  This rule requires submission of a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  An integral part of the RMP is a summary of policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility, including a description of the possible consequences in case of an accident and the actions, which will be taken, by the facility in an event of an emergency.\n\nThe following information is specifically required in the RMP Executive Summary: \n\n* Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies.\n\n* General facility and regulated substances information"

Preston WTP chlorine and ammonia systems are provided below.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe MDWASD accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, trains staff in operation and maintenance practices, and uses tested and proven management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the EPA's Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe MDWASD emergency response policy involves the preparation of emergency response plans for hazardous materials which are tailored to each facility and to the emergency response services available in the community, and is in compliance with the EPA Emergency Response Program Requirements.  John E. Preston WTP has prepared an Emergency Response Plan for the treatment plant to facilitate coordination and emergency planning with offsite response officials and facilities in the event of an emergency.\n\nGeneral Facility and Regulated Substance Information\n\nThe MDWASD John E. Preston WTP is located at 1100 West 2nd Avenue in Hialeah, Florida.  John E. Preston WTP is bounded to the North by West 13th Street, to the South by West 9th Street and the Hialeah Water Treatment Plant, and bounded to the West by West 3rd Avenue.  John E. Preston WTP covers 17.3 acres.  The facility stores chlorine and ammonia, which are regulated toxic substances under RMP rule.\n\nChlorine is delivered to John E. Preston WTP via 90-ton rail cars into the rail car enclosure. The rail cars contain liquid chlorine under pressure.   The rail car enclosure has a capacity of four cars but typically houses "

Preston WTP provides a total of approximately 13,000 pounds of chlorine per day to the softened water to maintain an average dose of 14 mg/L.   The chlorine rail cars at John E. Preston WTP also supply chlorine for the Hialeah WTP.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the John E. Preston WPT at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the EPA rule.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\n\nThe vapor pressure of the stored chlorine forces the liquid through the tubing and into the manifold system.  Downstream of the manifold system there is a pneumatically actuated shut-off valve.  Pressing one of the emergency shut-off switches manually closes the shut-off valve.  The emergency shut-off switches are located at the chlorine car enclosure, the chlorinator room and the ammonia control room.  The liquid chlorine flows through the shut-off valves to the evaporators located in the chlorinator room.  At the evaporators, the liquid chlorine is heated and converted into chlorine gas.  The gas then flows from the evaporators through the temperature-actuated control valve to the chlorinators.  The chlorinators are used to control the feed rate of the chlorine gas.  The chlorinators are equipped with a gas rotameter and a v-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate.  Injection of the chlorine into the process water produces the concentrated chlorine solution that flows through rubber-lined ductile iron piping to the various injection points in the treatment process.\n\nThe John E. Preston WTP chlorine system is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.

The shut-off valves are operated manually by pressing an emergency shut-off switch.  An emergency shut-off switch is located outside the chlorine car enclosure.\n\nThe shut-off valves in the chlorinator room are the same as those located in the chlorine car enclosure.  The valves are located on the two liquid chlorine supply lines that enter the chlorinator room.  As with the valves in the chlorine car enclosure, the shut-off valves in the control room are operated manually by pushing the emergency shut-off button.  The nearest shut-off button is located on the exterior wall of the chlorinator room.\n\nThe leak detection and alarm system in the chlorine car enclosure is tripped when chlorine gas is sensed.  The leak detection system is set to activate the alarms when a chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm or higher is detected.  When the leak detection system detects a leak, audible and visual alarms (both local and in the control room) are activated.  When the chlorine alarms are tripped, personnel are restricted from entering the contaminated area without the appropriate protective equipment.\n\nA chlorine leak detection and alarm system like the one in the chlorine car enclosure is located inside the chlorinator room.

It also exceeds the listed threshold quantity in the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard.\n\nBoth liquefied and gaseous ammonia is present in the bulk storage tank.  Gaseous ammonia is supplied to the ammoniators under pressure from the top of the storage tank.  The ammonia gas flows under pressure through piping to a pressure-reducing valve (pressure regulator) which reduces the pressure to the range of 30 to 40 psig.  From the pressure-reducing valve, the ammonia gas then flows through piping to the ammoniators located in the ammoniator room.  The ammoniator room houses five ammoniators, each ammoniator is equipped with a rotameter and a V-notched orifice for controlling the feed rate manually. Downstream of the ammoniators, the ammonia gas is fed to one of two pipes for subsequent injection at the desired feed points.\n\nThe Preston WTP ammonia system is also provided with a number of safety features to protect the employees and the surrounding community.  The four important safety features are (1) shut-off valves, (2) pressure relief valves, (3) check valves, and (4) ammonia leak detectors.

Preston WTP is also provided with a backup emergency power generator that supplies power to the entire facility.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two release scenarios, identified as \"worst-case release scenario\" and \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the maximum quantity in the largest vessel is released over 10-minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure. The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\". EPA also requires the performance of one worst-case release scenario for all the regulated toxic substances and one alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance used in a covered process. \n\nChlorine and ammonia are the two regulated toxic substances stored and handled at the John E. Preston WTP, which are subject to the RMP rule.  Since chlorine was estimated to create the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint, thus, chlorine was selected for the worst-case release scenario.  Only passive or administrative controls are allowed under this scenario to reduce off-site impacts.  The scenario used for the John E.

Preston WTP for the chlorine railcars; thus, the chlorine release rate will be 18,000 lbs./min.\n\nThe released liquid chlorine is assumed to form a denser-than-air cloud consisting of chlorine vapor and liquid droplets (aerosols) and then disperse in the atmosphere.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was estimated using the EPA's RMP*Comp software (version 1.06).  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA rule for chlorine is 3 ppm, which is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The toxic endpoint was conservatively set by EPA to ensure public notification and that local emergency response planning takes into account the greatest possible impacted area surrounding the release point. EPA-mandated meteorological conditions, namely atmospheric Stability Class F, wind speed of 1.5 meter per second, highest daily maximum temperature (77 deg F), and average relative humidity (50%) were used for the worst-case release scenario analysis.  The results of the dispersion analysis indicated that the worst-case release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nRMP rules require that a scenario which results in offsite toxic endpoint distance and is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario should be selected as the alternative release scenario for each regulated toxic substance, unless no such scenario exists.  The alternative release scenario may also be an actual event, which occurred at the facility.  Unlike the worst-case scenario, the alternative release scenario may consider \"active\" mitigation such as automatic shutoff valves, excess flow valves, and containment with scrubbers.

This scenario occurs due to the operator using a faulty old flex hose, which results in a crack in the flex hose during the withdrawal of chlorine from the railcar.  It is assumed that the crack developed in the 1-inch diameter flex hose equates to a hole of 3/16-inch (0.1875-inch) diameter.  The control room would have been warned of the chlorine leak by the chlorine monitors installed at the chlorination facility.  It is assumed that approximately ten minutes would be required for operators or an emergency response team to respond and activate the remote controlled shutoff valve.  The chlorine release rate for this alternative release scenario was estimated at 87 lb./min.  No passive mitigation was considered for the estimation of chlorine release rate.  However, human input in closing the shut-off valve was taken into account as an active mitigation, which will reduce the quantity of chlorine released to the atmosphere.\n\nThe toxic endpoint distance for the chlorine alternative release scenario was estimated using lookup table from EPA's Water Treatment Plant RMP Guidance document.  Toxic endpoint for chlorine is 3 ppm.  EPA suggested typical meteorological conditions used were Stability D, wind speed of 3.0 meter per second, average air temperature of 77 deg F, and average relative humidity of 50 percent.  The results of the toxic endpoint distance analysis for chlorine indicated that the alternative release scenario has offsite impacts.\n\nThe second alternative release scenario selected was for ammonia that involved the release of ammonia from the piping connecting the ammonia storage tank to the process.  It is assumed that the hole/rupture that develops in the piping equates to a hole of 5/16-inch (0.3125-inch) diameter. The control room would have been warned of the ammonia leak by the ammonia monitors installed at the facility.  It is assumed that approximately ten minutes would be required for operator"

This information includes chlorine and ammonia background information and MSDS sheets.\n\nEquipment safety information was meticulously compiled on the chlorine and ammonia processes.  Specifications for chlorine and ammonia processes are collected and provided in one place for easy reference.  Details such as maximum intended inventory; safe upper and lower temperatures; safe upper and lower pressures; and codes and standards used to design, build, and operate the processes are on file at the facility.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nIn 1997, detailed Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) were conducted for the chlorine and ammonia systems equipment and procedures.  To further assess the integrity of the chlorine and ammonia systems for the preparation of this RMP, checklists were used to assess the overall general condition of the chlorine and ammonia systems operation and maintenance, including human factors that affect personnel performance and system integrity.  The PHA(s) will be updated again within a five-year period or whenever there is major change in the processes.  A list of recommended actions were developed to further improve the chlorine and ammonia safety and staff is currently evaluating these recommendations.  Staff will document the completion of recommended actions.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMDWASD John E. Preston WTP has pre"
