Some people who are particularly susceptible to the substance released could be incapacitated.\n\nThe RMP rule includes specific requirements for the worst-case and alternative release scenarios that must be reported by CHAMPION.  These requirements are:\n\t\n* one worst-case release scenario for each Program 1 process (the Quinnesec Mill does not have any processes meeting the Program 1 definition)\n* one worst-case release scenario for the class of toxic substances in Program 3 processes (i.e., one scenario representing the Chlorine Dioxide process)  \n* one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances in a Program 3 process (i.e. one scenario representing the Chlorine Dioxide process, one scenario for the Chlorine - Clearwell process and one scenario for the Chlorine - Raw Water process)\n* one worst-case and one alternative release scenario for the class of flammable substances in Program 2 and Program 3 processes (the Quinnesec Mill does not have any process chemicals meeting the flammable substance definition)\n\nThe following information summarizes the offsite consequence analysis performed by CHAMPION. \n\n1.3.1 Program 3 Processes - Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for toxic substances is the instantaneous release of the entire contents of a 100,000 gal (417 ton) chlorine dioxide solution (1.2% chlorine dioxide - by weight) storage tank in the Chlorine Dioxide System. The solution is assumed to flow beyond containment curbing and sewers and form a pool of chlorine dioxide solution, which evaporates and forms a vapor cloud. The actual quantity of chlorine dioxide in the solution (10,000 lbs.) would be released to atmosphere over a 60 minute period. The scenario results in off-site impacts to both public and environmental receptors."

Operators would be notified of a release by chlorine dioxide monitors located throughout the process area.  Local drains and sewers would limit the extent of spread of the water solution, limiting the vaporization of chlorine dioxide. Approximately 300 lbs. of chlorine dioxide would be released from the time the incident began, until emergency responders would stop the leak 30 minutes later.  While the event results in off-site impact, there are no public or environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Chlorine - Clearwell process is shearing off a valve on a 1-ton chlorine container. Operators are immediately notified of a release by chlorine monitors located in the process area. Approximately 250 lbs. of chlorine would be released from the time the incident began, until emergency responders would stop the leak 30 minutes later.   The off-site impact would affect public receptors, but does not affect any environmental receptors.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for the Chlorine - Raw Water process, located 1 1/2 miles south of the main mill complex, would be the same as above, except for the off-site impact. While the event results in off-site impact, there are no public or environmental receptors located within this distance.\n\n\n1.4 Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-specific Prevention \n\nThe Quinnesec Mill has always focused on ways to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.

A model is a mathematical estimate of the way a chemical plume moves and reacts after it is released to the air. The air quality model provides more realistic and detailed information on estimated plume dimensions, concentration of pollutants by downwind distance, time of travel and the location of the plume at discreet time intervals. These data have been provided to the Dickinson County LEPC to assist them in planning for any actions that should be taken if, the unlikely event of an accident should occur at the Quinnesec Mill.\n\n\nChampion selected two models to evaluate off-site impacts:  an EPA approved screening model known as SCREEN3 and TRACE. TRACE is a comprehensive hazard assessment software package for analyzing the impact of toxic, flammable and explosive chemical releases in the atmosphere.  TRACE can simulate toxic chemical releases resulting from tank failures and pipe leaks for gases that are heavier than air or for neutrally buoyant gasses.  TRACE has the capability to model ground level or elevated releases in the form of dense clouds or buoyant plumes. SCREEN3 was used to simulate the release of chlorine dioxide due to a loss of the scrubber control system on the chlorine dioxide generator.  TRACE was used to evaluate the release of chlorine dioxide due to a leak in a chlorine dioxide transfer pipe.  The same model was also used to evaluate the potential off-site impact of a potential release of chlorine due to a leak in a valve on a 2000 lb. chlorine storage container.\n\nTypical information input to the model to characterize a chemical release is:\n\n* Physical State:  gas, liquid, aerosol, and multi-phased\n* Release Type:  continuous, instantaneous, point (stack releases), and area (releases from a pool)\n* Release Condition:  height, substrate type (concrete, soil), area and height of curbing, exit velocity, release diamet"

Meteorological data is used in dispersion models to calculate the distance that the pollutant plume moves downwind and the concentration of the pollutant at any given time or distance.  The meteorological variables that affect the dispersion of a chemical release are as follows:\n\n* Wind Speed and Direction: The wind speed is used to determine the plume dilution, plume transport, plume rise, evaporation rate, and magnitude of the concentration.  Wind direction defines the direction in which the plume travels.\n* Temperature:  Temperature is used to calculate plume rise and evaporation rates.\n* Atmospheric Pressure: is used to calculate gas and liquid release rates.\n* Atmospheric Stability: Stability is an indication of atmospheric turbulence.  The turbulence is depended upon thermal (heating of the ground) and mechanical (surface roughness and wind speed) effects.  Turbulence also acts to dilute the plume and reduce concentrations.  \n\nFor the RMP modeling performed the following meteorological parameters were used for the alternate release scenarios:\n\n* Wind Speed:  3.0 meters/second\n* Stability:    D\n* Temperature:  60 deg.

This is accomplished by: (1) an inspection and testing program to help identify equipment deterioration and damage before the equipment fails, (2) a quality assurance program to help ensure that new and replacement equipment meet the design standards required for service in the covered processes and (3) utilizing personnel who are specially trained to maintain process equipment.  \n\n\t6.\tManagement of Change:  The CHAMPION management of change program evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for a covered process to help ensure that the change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g., replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a management of change form.  All other changes must be reviewed through the full management of change program, to help ensure that inadvertent consequences of process changes are prevented, safety consequences of changes are addressed, affected process safety information and procedures are updated, and affected employees are notified of the changes.\n\n\t7.\tPre-startup Review:  CHAMPION performs a safety review of a new or modified process before the process is placed into service to help ensure that the process is safe to operate.  This review confirms that an employee has completed the requisite training.  The review also confirms that adequate safety, operating, maintenance, and emergency procedures are in place and that construction and equipment are in accordance with design specifications.  A pre-startup review checklist is completed to document the review and to ensure that appropriate issues have been addressed.\n\n\t8"

CHAMPION provides response training to CHAMPION personnel, designates an emergency response coordinator to oversee response activities, and coordinates response efforts with the local fire department. The Qunnesec Mill maintains a Hazardous Materials Response team that is trained and equipped to respond to on-site chemical releases. Response activities have also been discussed with the LEPC.\n\nIn order to effectively implement these policies, CHAMPION established a management system headed by the mill's Operations Manager to oversee safety-related activities.\n\n\n1.2 CHAMPION and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Quinnesec Mill is an integrated pulp and paper mill primarily involved in the manufacture of bleached pulp and related finished paper products.  As part of this manufacturing process, CHAMPION handles regulated substances in sufficient quantities to be covered by the RMP rule, as shown in the following list of RMP-covered processes at the Quinnesec Mill.\n\n\nProcess\t\t\t\t\tChlorine - Raw Water\nProgram Level\t\t\t\t3\nRegulated Substance\t\t\tChlorine\nMaximum Process Quantity\t\t16,000 pounds\nLargest Single Vessel\t\t\t2,000 pounds\n\nProcess\t\t\t\t\tChlorine - Clearwell\nProgram Level\t\t\t\t3\nRegulated Substance\t\t\tChlorine\nMaximum Process Quantity\t\t16,000 pounds\nLargest Single Vessel\t\t\t2,000 pounds\n\nProcess\t\t\t\t\tChlorine Dioxide System *\nProgram Level\t\t\t\t3\nRegulated Substance\t\t\tChlorine Dioxide\nMaximum Process Quantity\t\t20,000 pounds\nLargest Single Vessel\t\t\t10,000 pounds\n\n*  1.2% w/w water solution of chlorine dioxide\n\n1.3 Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nCHAMPION performed an analysis of the potential offsite consequence an accidental release of a regulated substance could have on the public or the environment.

Chlorine dioxide is produced at the Quinnesec Mill and stored as a dilute water solution to minimize the potential for serious incident or off-site impact.  The process is located almost entirely indoors, which further reduces the hazard.  Storage tanks are engineered specifically for chlorine dioxide service.  Inventory is limited to an 8 hour supply for bleaching.  The process uses an advanced control system, with emergency shutdowns, to ensure safe operation.  Containment sewers and curbing are provided to minimize the extent of potential leaks. Detectors and alarms provide continuous monitoring for chlorine dioxide in the event of a release, providing early detection and helping to ensure quick response if an incident were to occur.\n\n\n1.5 Five-Year Accident History\n\nCHAMPION has completed a review for incidents occurring in the five-year period prior to the submittal date for the regulation.  During the five year period prior to June, 1999, there have been no incidents involving the regulated processes which have resulted in on-site or off-site impacts.  The Quinnesec Mill is committed to maintaining this high level of safety performance.\n\n\n1.6 Emergency Response Programs\n\nCHAMPION has established a written emergency response program to help safely respond to accidental releases of hazardous substances.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for:\n\n* clear identification of communication, roles and responsibilities during an emergency event.\n* informing the LEPC about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences\n* providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment to treat accidental human exposure to hazardous substa"

CHAMPION assembles an audit team that includes personnel knowledgeable in the RMP rule and in the process. This team evaluates whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the RMP rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the process.  The results of the audit are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate improvements to the prevention program are implemented.\n\n\t9.\tIncident Investigation:   CHAMPION investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment so that similar incidents can be prevented.  CHAMPION trains employees to identify and report any incident requiring investigation.  An investigation team is assembled, and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident. The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process improvements are implemented.\n\n\t10.\tEmployee Participation:  The Quinnesec Mill developed a written employee participation program for covered processes to help ensure that CHAMPION workers participate in the development and continuous improvement of these prevention program elements. Employees are consulted on and informed about various aspects of the RMP rule prevention program, including PHAs and operating procedures, as well as access to information on the covered processes. \n\n\t11.\tHot Work Permits:  CHAMPION uses a hot work permit program to control spark- or flame-producing activities that could result in fires or explosions in covered processes at the Quinnesec Mill.
