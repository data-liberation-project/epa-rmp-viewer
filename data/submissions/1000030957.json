Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employees whose job tasks are affected by a modification to process operations, are promptly made aware of, and given, information and training to safely manage the modification.\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Reviews:\r\n\r\nPre-startup reviews related to new processes, and to modifications of established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Sysco Louisville Inc..  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for a safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits:\r\n\r\nSysco Louisville Inc. conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions required by the RMP regulation are being implemented.  These audits are completed at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are completed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nIncident Investigation:\r\n\r\nSysco Louisville Inc. promptly investigated any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of Ammonia (anhydrous).  These investigations are conducted to identify the circumstances leading up to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release or near-miss from recurring.  All accident/incident reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation:\r\n\r\nSysco Louisville Inc. believes that process safety management and accident prevention require a team effort.  Company and contractor employees are urged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements for the ammonia refrigeration system.  In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP regulation, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, in particular.\r\n\r\nContractors:\r\n\r\nSysco Louisville Inc. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction"
