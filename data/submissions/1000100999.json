This commitment is embraced by each member of our team, no matter what position or area. Active roles include an obligation to point out any deficient safety or environmental practices that are observed anytime, anywhere. Positive reinforcement will be our primary motivation tool to benchmark satisfactory performance. Safety hazards or environmental concerns are exposed and relayed to team members without fear of reprisal or resentment. Great safety and environmental records are a team effort.\r\n\r\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\r\n\r\nThe facility is located on an approximate 3-acre site, with shipping and receiving areas. The major structures and their designated functions are Warehouse, Receiving Area, Machinery Spaces, Production Areas, Coolers, Blast Cells, and Holding Freezers. The facility produces poultry (turkey) products. The facility operates an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system to produce space cooling, product cooling, and process equipment cooling. The refrigeration system is designed to provide operating flexibility (through availability of multiple operating equipment combinations); economy and efficiency of operations (through the use of operating pressures commensurate with the degree of cooling required); optimal safety performance: and, consistency of operation, utilizing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to monitor, record, operate, and modulate refrigeration equipment as conditions require. Major equipment components include compressors, condensers, receivers, re-circulators and other vessels, and a variety of heat exchangers (evaporators, air handlers, freezers, etc.).\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENT RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented a Process Safety Management program for its ammonia refrigeration process operation and maintenance. The PSM Program has been incorporated as bot"
