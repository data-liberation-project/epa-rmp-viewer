We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the surrounding community, as well as the protection of the environment.  The executive summary provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP regulation\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAn overview of our accidental release programs\n\u00c2\u00bf\tA five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA\u00c2\u00bfs RMP rule\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAn overview of our emergency response program\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAn overview of planned improvements at the facility to help prevent accidental chemical releases from occurring and adversely affecting our employees, the public, and the environment.\n\nThe information supplied in this RMP submittal is accurate and up-to-date.  Since the initial RMP submittal in 1999, the W.G. Krummrich plant has significantly changed.  Several processes have been shut down.   These shutdowns have reduced two RMP chemicals at the site to below their threshold amounts; Anhydrous Ammonia and Nitric Acid have been eliminated.  The on-site storage volume of Chlorine and Aqueous Ammonia has been significantly reduced.\n\n1.0 STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe W.G. Krummrich Plant is the oldest of the U.S. Solutia Plants, with approximately 131 employees.  In 1917, as part of Monsanto, the site was purchased from the Commercial Acids Company, which had started the plant in 1907 to manufacture sulfuric, muriatic and nitric acids.  Today the plant occupies over 94 acres and manufactures a variety of chemical intermediates.  In our processes, we use the following chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite con"

Solutia has implemented strict unloading and handling procedures for this material.  A number of 90-ton rail cars are stored in the plant and are used by one department.   The chlorine is used directly from the rail cars through state-of-the-art unloading systems.  Solutia\u00c2\u00bfs W. G.
