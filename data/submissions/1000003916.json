ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     Penobscot McCrum recognizes management's responsibility to protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of ammonia release incidents has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of all Penobscot McCrum personnel who operate their ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n     The Penobscot McCrum PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its ammonia operating and management systems.  The Penobscot McCrum PSM/RMP program focuses attention on making PSM/RMP an important part of its operation.\n\n     Penobscot/McCrum believes that employee participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program.  Operating level employees, particularly the refrigeration manager has been deeply involved and he (along with the refrigeration system operators) assumes the major responsibility for operating the hazardous material process safely.\n\n     The Penobscot McCrum emergency action plan has been developed in house and is seeking assistance from and cooperation with the local public emergency response agency.  All Penobscot McCrum employees have received documented emergency action training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     Penobscot McCrum operates an ammonia refrigeration system.  Ammonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as agriculture, water treatment, food storage warehouses, pharmaceuticals, heat treating and many, many more.  Ammonia has been listed by both EPA and OSHA as a hazardous substance.\n\n\nIII. SUMMARY OF WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS\n\nDispersion cloud modeling studies have been performed as required by PSM/RMP regulations and the information developed has been used in the preparation of the Technical"

DESCRIPTION OF THE Penobscot McCrum ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n     Penobscot McCrum conducts in house emergency action training and is seeking a response relationship the local public emergency response agency to practice and update a unified response to an unintentional ammonia release situation.\n\n     Penobscot McCrum conducts triennial PSM/RMP compliance audits of their PSM/RMP program to identify strengths and weaknesses and make improvements. Penobscot McCrum considers the PSM/RMP manuals to be a living documents that must be updated and revised regularly to maintain their viability and usefulness.\n\n     Penobscot McCrum emphasizes and insists on \"employee participation\" from their ammonia process operators in all aspects of the development, implementation, and integration of their PSM/RMP program.\n\n    Penobscot McCrum provides a comprehensive, computer based, user friendly training program and management system with specific training modules available for each ammonia process employee.\n\n     Penobscot McCrum maintains a pro-active \"open-door\" policy toward neighbors and concerned community citizens.  Facility tours and risk management discussions are scheduled and conducted upon written request.\n\nV.  FIVE YEAR ACCIDENTAL RELEASE HISTORY\n\n     There have been no releases of ammonia during the past five years that resulted in an injury, or that had an off-site impact, or that resulted in significant property damage either on-site or off-site.\n\nVI. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\n     Facility employees have been trained to respond to accidental ammonia releases with defensive measures, namely evacuate, give notice and assemble response stragegy.  The site emergency plan is being coordinated with local Public Emergency Responders.\n\nVII.

The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before safety truly becomes second nature.\n\n     Penobscot McCrum expects to improve PSM/RMP and safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program:\n\n(1)   EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION:  Employee Participation is the key to a successful program. Ammonia Process Managers and Operators have been deeply involved in verifying P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections and they will continue to monitor progress.\n\n(2)  PROCESS HAZARDS ANALYSIS: All recommendations developed during the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) Revalidation were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Penobscot McCrum will evaluate each PHA recommendation and document the action taken.\n\n(4) AUDITS:   Programs are audited every 3 years as required by the OSHA PSM to improve Safety Performance as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations. \n\n(5)  STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES:  SOP's are certified annually to be current and correct.  They are revised as often as necessary to keep them current and correct.\n\n(6)  TRAINING:  Documented Orientation Training (both classroom and On-the-Job) is provided employees before ammonia related work assignments are given.  Renewal training, including documented training tests, are provided annually.\n\n(7)  PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS:  Critical Ammonia Equipment is routinely inspected and maintained according to manufacturer's recommendations."
