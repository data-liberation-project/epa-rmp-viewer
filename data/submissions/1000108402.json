The facility has one covered processes and meets the Program 3 requirements for the pentane mixture of the Risk Management Program (RMP) regulations  \nPentane Mixture\nNCFI Polyurethanes uses two (2) different chemical components in the blending production of hydrocarbon based foam raw materials.  Polyol and a hydrocarbon blowing agent (the pentane mixture) are blended onsite to create the Poly Blend.  Three (3) different raw material polyols are transferred from the 3,000 gallon storage tanks located within the Pentane Operations Room into the adjacent Max Machinery Blending Unit to formulate the Polyol Blend.  \n \nB.

NCFI Polyurethanes evaluated one worst-case release scenario and two alternative case release scenarios for the pentane mixture for inclusion on the RMPlan.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nPentane Mixture\nThe worst-case flammable release scenario for the pentane mixture was determined to be a vapor cloud explosion of the largest tank of the pentane mixture. A release of this magnitude is extremely unlikely due to the design and rigorous maintenance and prevention program present at the NCFI Polyurethanes facility. The distance to the toxic endpoint was the distance to an overpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi).\nPentane Mixture\nFor the pentane mixture two alternative release scenarios were considered and evaluated.\nD.\tFive-year Accident History\nUnder the EPA RMP regulations, an accidental release is defined as a release of a regulated substance that \"resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\"  Within the past five years, NCFI Polyurethanes has had no accidents that meet these requirements.\nE.\tPrevention Program (Pentane Mixture)\nEmployee Participation\nIn accordance with the requirements of OSHA's PSM regulations and EPA's RMP regulations, NCFI Polyurethanes has developed and implemented written procedures, which ensure all employees working in the pentane mixture areas, or directly on the design and/or safety review of the Covered Process are:\n- Aware of and are actively involved in the development of the information comprising its RMP/PSM Plan \n- Consulted prior to any revisions to its RMP/PSM Plan; and\n- Actively involved with the develop"
