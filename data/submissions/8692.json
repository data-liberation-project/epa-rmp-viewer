In the event that an accidental release should occur, we are prepared to work with our Local Fire Department, Emergency Response Personnel, and other appropriate authorities deemed applicable depending on the specific incident, to best mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility Information\n\nThe primary activity of our company is NAICS code 42291 Farm Supplies Wholesalers, whereas we are engaged in providing agricultural inputs that include the receiving, storage, and reloading of Anhydrous Ammonia for delivery to farmers in our area.  This product is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program and is the subject of this plan.  Only the facilities used for this product will be included in this report.\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct applications to farm fields during the early spring and late fall months.  During the balance of the year, inventories will be storage only, with little, if any product transfer taking place.  The maximum quantity stored in pressurized permanent storage vessels at the location described is 140,000 lbs.  The maximum on site vessel size is 30,000 gallons, storing 140,000 lbs.  The maximum quantity handled at a given time would be the off loading of a semi-trailer vehicle tank holding 40,000 to 42,000 lbs.\n\nThis portion of the facility is operated on an as needed basis with staff present only during the receiving and reloading of product for delivery. However this facility has 12 fulltime employees.  Our facilities have adequate lighting, and are inspected at various times day or night during use, and through out the off season when not in use.\n\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-ca"

      "SummaryText": "se scenario would be release of the total contents of our largest Anhydrous Ammonia tank, release as a gas liquified by pressure over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity release would be 140,000 lbs., based on 85% tank capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 4.4 miles based on EPA's RMP Comp guidance program.  Residential population within this area is approximately 1800 based on most recent census data.\n\nAlternate Release Scenario\n\nAs we have not had an actual release of Anhydrous Ammonia during the last 5-years at the site, we believe the most likely release would be caused by a break in a transfer hose.  Transfer hoses are protected by manual, self closing excess flow, and pull away valves.  Our alternative release scenario is based on the loss of contents from the largest hose used (off loading transportation equipment).  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.1_ miles (528 feet) based on EPA's RMP Comp guidance program.\n\n\nAccidental Release Program\n\nFor Anhydrous Ammonia, our accidental release program is based on guidelines found in the American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) standard K-61.1 Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia; and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 29CFR1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia.  Additionally, we conduct annual employee training on the safe handling, transportation and distribution of Anhydrous Ammonia, and have installed safety equipment including, but not limited to:  Excess flow valves, break-away couplers at risers, emergency shut-off valves, barriers to avoid damage by trucks or other vehicles, and lock-outs to prevent tampering when site is unattended.  Finally, we maintain routine contact with our local fire department and emergency response personnel; and have provided and/or participated in safety training exercises on Anhydrous Amm"

We also include these materials in our own Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA standard 29CFR1910.38.  We have provided State and Local authorities all Community Right-to-Know information requested as well as that required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).  Our written employee safety programs include pre-emergency planning and employee training in accordance with OSHA standards, and are offered for review at any time by our Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to ensure that they conform to the community plan(s).  We actively encourage participation in our Anhydrous Ammonia program by the local fire department, local emergency response team, community planners, etc., that may be expected to respond to an incident at our site.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at all of our facilities.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\nAdditional Information"
