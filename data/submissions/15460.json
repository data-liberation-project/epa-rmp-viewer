If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Dudley Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  The Dudley Fire Department would, based on severity, summon additional units from surrounding towns.\n\nThis facility is a contract manufacturing plant.  We manufacture aerosols and perform liquid filling.  We use propane, isobutane and a butane/propane blend as propellants in the aerosol cans.  We have one 6-thousand gallon propane tank and two 30-thousand gallon tanks containing isobutane and a butane/propane mixture.  We also have piping, valves and other miscellaneous equipment.\n\nOur worst- case scenario is failure of the 30 thousand gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest capacity allowed (88% at 60F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The resulting endpoint extends offsite, and public and environmental receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  Our alternate release is a pipe break.  The pipe is 2 inches in diameter and the release is for one minute.  The distance to the lower flammability limit extends offsite, and public and environmental receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nThis facility complies with accident prevention rules and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.  The storage system is engineered, installed and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state laws.\n\nWe have never had an accident involving propellants that resulted in death, major injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations or sheltering in place.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving our propellant system, it is our policy to notify the Dudley Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  We have discussed this policy with the fire department; members of the fire department have inspected our facility."
