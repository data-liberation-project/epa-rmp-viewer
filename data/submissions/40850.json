      "SummaryText": "The Pleasant Prairie Distribution Center is a wholesale food warehouse suppling frozen foods, perishables, and dry goods to retail grocery stores. Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant to maintain coolers and freezer rooms. The largest holding tank has an 80% compacity of 15,000 pounds, but usually no more than 6,500 to 7,500 pounds at any one time. Should a catastrophic release occur, there is the possibility of an explosion from an ammonia concentration of 16-25%. To prevent this from happening the engine room is equipped with emergency ventilation and all of the electrical switch gear is located away from the engine room. First Responder Teams are trained in the use of SCBA wear through annual training. Emergency Master Shut-off button is located outside of the ammonia buiolding."
