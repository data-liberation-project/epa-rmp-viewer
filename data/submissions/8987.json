Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\nThe Town of North Attleborough Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) is committed to operating its wastewater treatment facility in Attleboro, Massachusetts in an environmentally responsible manner and to providing a safe workplace for its employees and the surrounding community.  As part of this commitment to environmental stewardship and worker safety, the WWTF has developed and implemented environmental and safety programs designed to reduce or eliminate the potential for accidental releases.  The WWTF has also developed and implemented a number of programs designed to ensure that if an accidental release occurs it will be handled in a manner that minimizes adverse impact to personnel, the surrounding community, the environment and the facility. \n\nThe WWTF views accident prevention, personnel protection, and environmental protection as continuous processes.  Consequently, The WWTF continuously strives to improve its accident prevention, environmental protection and emergency response programs. The WWTFs Risk Management Program complements this overall accident prevention and response program.  The WWTPs Risk Management Program (RMP) complies with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (\"EPAs\") Chemical Accident Prevention rule found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68.  This RMP Plan provides the public with information about the treatment facility's processes, accident prevention programs, and emergency response planning efforts.   The WWTFs compliance with EPAs RMP rule includes:\n\n1. Completion of a hazard assessment in compliance with 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart B, including the five-year accidental release history.  The WWTF has never experienced an RMP reportable release or accident.\n2. Implementation of an accident prevention program.  The facility's RMP accident p"

Under the RMP rules, the WWTF is classified as a Level 2 facility, and must prepare an accident prevention program in compliance with RMPs Level 2 accident prevention program requirements;\n3. Implementation of an emergency response program.  As recommended in the RMP rule and by numerous federal response entities, the facility has developed an integrated contingency plan designed to meet applicable state and federal emergency response and accident prevention planning requirements. \n\nAdditional information regarding how the WWTF addresses each of these requirements is provided below and in the attached RMP plan.\n\nWhile the RMP program at the WWTF helps ensure that the facility is maintained and operated in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, it is just one component of the WWTFs comprehensive safety and environmental programs.  Additional components beyond the scope of the RMP include, but are not limited to: regular employee/contractor safety training, periodic table-top safety and emergency response drills, acquisition and maintenance of emergency response and personnel protective equipment, development of safe work practices (confined space, lockout/tagout, hot work), implementation of safe work procedures, new project safety review procedures, preventive maintenance and regular inspections of all tanks and equipment that contain hazardous chemicals, chemical control and purchasing procedures, medical emergency response training, contractor certification, etc. \n\nThe facility and all equipment are designed and operated to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.  At a minimum, the facility and equipment meet government and industry design and construction standards.\n\nB.

The only chemical present at the facility in sufficient quantities to be regulated by the chemical accident prevention rule is chlorine.  Chlorine is used to disinfect wastewater.\n\nChlorine is stored in 2,000 lb. tanks within the chlorine room, and is injected into the water stream in the adjacent chlorinator room. Both rooms are equipped with chlorine detectors which sound an alarm in the event of an accidental release of chlorine.\n\nThe total maximum amount of chlorine stored on-site is 6,000 lbs. (3 tanks).  The maximum amount of chlorine used at any one time in the chlorination process is 4,000 lbs.\n\nC. Off-site Consequence Analysis\n\nAs required by the RMP rule, the WWTFs off-site consequence analysis included evaluation of a worst-case accidental release for all toxic chemicals and an alternative release for each covered chemical.\n\nA worst-case release is defined by EPA as \"a release of the largest quantity of a regulated substance from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to an endpoint defined in ' 68.22.\"  40 C.F.R. ' 68.3.   EPA requires the worst-case accidental release to be modeled using highly conservative meteorological data designed to result in the maximum possible adverse impact.  For example, EPA requires worst-case models to assume that the entire contents of the largest vessel are released instantaneously on a warm night with slow, steady wind.  According to the Chlorine Institute, no 2,000 lb. chlorine tank has ever released its contents in ten minutes.  The probability of such an event is extremely low.\n\nUsing the EPA mandated criteria described above, the worst-case release at the WWTF (for purposes of RMP) would involve a complete failure of a 2,000 lb. chlorine tank, filled to maximum capacity.  If such a \nrelease occurred, it would result in a vapor cloud that could impact persons outside of the f"

While the WWTF has had no reportable releases, EPA requires modeling of a release which could impact off-site locations. After considering all criteria in the RMP rule and the Hazard Assessment performed on the chlorination process, the WWTF has chosen an alternative release scenario that involves a whip failure in the chlorine room. This scenario represents what staff believe to be the most likely scenario for a significant chlorine release.\n\nD. Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe WWTF has developed an accidental release prevention program designed and implemented to reduce the possibility of an accidental catastrophic release.   The program complies with the RMP requirements found at 40 C.F.R. Part 68, Subpart D.  While elements of this plan have been in place for years, the plan as a whole was recently implemented.  Even prior to the implementation of this plan no reportable releases had occurred at the treatment facility.\n\nThe basic elements of the WWTFs prevention program are described below: \n\n1.0 Safety Information.  The WWTF has compiled written process safety information which helped identify the hazards posed by chlorine, handling of materials, management, storage activities and the chlorination process in general.  The compilation of process safety information provided the foundation for understanding the hazards involved in the chlorination  process and was crucial to the development of a complete and thorough hazard analysis.  The required safety information includes information pertaining to the hazardous chemicals (e.g. chlorine), the technology of the process, and the process equipment.   40 C.F.R.

The WWTF has developed and implements written procedures to maintain the ongoing integrity of the process equipment listed below.  The WWTF also trains employees to maintain the process equipment.  See 40 C.F.R. 68.56.\n\n6.0 Incident Investigation.  The WWTF investigates each incident which resulted in, or could reasonably have resulted in, a catastrophic release of a highly hazardous chemical.  An incident investigation team is established and consists of at least one person knowledgeable in the process involved, including a contract employee if the incident involved work of the contractor, and other persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to thoroughly investigate and analyze the incident. See 40 C.F.R. ' 68.60.\n\n7.0 Compliance Audits.  The WWTF will evaluate its compliance with the RMP rule at least every three years to verify that the procedures and practices it has developed are adequate and being followed.
