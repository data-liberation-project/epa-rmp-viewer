Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nWe ar Kool Kountry Cold Storage are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensiveaccidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Fruit cold storage operations. We have 1 regulated substance present at out facility. This substance is Ammonia (anhydrous) and is used in the refrigeration process.\n\nThe total capacity of ammonia at our facility is 15,758\n\n3. The Worst Case Release Scenarios and the Alternative Release Scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario:\n\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration Reference Tables or Equations. The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program 2 and 3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophe release from the ammonia refrigeration system. In this scenario 15,758 lbs of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released. The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place. The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes. At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 2.25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from the ammonia refrigeration system. The scenario involves the release of"

The entire pool is estimated to have evaporated after 50.00 minutes. Passive mitigation controls such as an enclosure has been taken into account to calculate the scenario, having the effect of minimizing the release fo ammonia into the atmosphere. The release is also assumed to be controlled by an emergency shutdown system. This active mitigation system has the effect of controlling the amount of ammonia released. Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.19 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1967 Edition. The following sectins briefly describe the elements fo the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses is What If. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operatins and are revalidated at a regular interval of every three years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner. The most recent PHA/update was performed on 10/16/2008.\n\nOperating Procedures:\nFor the purposes of safely conductiong activities within our covered processes, Kool Kountry Cold Storage maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operation, emergency shutdown, emergency operat"

Refresher training is provided at least every year and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity:\nKool Kountry Cold Storage carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping system, relief and vent system, emergency shutdown system, controls and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Futhermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nMamagement of Change:\nWritten procedures are in place at Kool Kountry Cold Storage to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. The most recent review/revision of maintenance procedures was performed on 10/16/2008. Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Review:\nPre-startup safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as regular practice at Kool Kountry Cold Storage. The most recent review was performed on 10/16/2008. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits:\nKool Kountry Cold Storage conduct"

These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation:\nKool Kountry Cold Storage truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors:\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. Prior to selecting a contractor, a through evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Kool Kountry Cold Storage has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for the emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n5. Five-year Accident History\nKool Kountry Cold Storage has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.

Inaddition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety:\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Monthly safety meetings and ongoing employee training and periodic safety inspections are some of the major steps we want to take to improve safety at our facility. These changes are expected to be implemented by 12/31/2009"
