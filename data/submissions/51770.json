      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc.\nHometown Electronics Specialty Gases Facility\n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nAt this facility, we produce fluorine and fluorine derivative gases for packaging into compressed gas cylinders or tube trailers.  During the fluorine manufacturing process, we use hydrogen fluoride as a raw material.  We also re-package anhydrous hydrogen chloride from bulk railcars.  Anhydrous ammonia is used in a reaction with fluorine to produce one of the fluorine derivative gases and is purified and packaged into other bulk containers.  Arsine cylinders are stored in our shipping/receiving area.  Containers of boron trichloride are accumulated and stored to have the residual material eventually repackaged into other containers for resale or disposal.  All six chemicals listed above, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHAi??s HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPAi??s Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).

      "SummaryText": "elected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is the production of specialty and electronic gases and chemicals.  A majority of these gases are derived from fluorine, which is generated at the site in electrolytic cells by electrical decomposition of hydrogen fluoride.  Hydrogen is generated as a by-product, which is vented in small amounts to the atmosphere.  The electrolysis takes place in a cell containing hydrogen fluoride with dissolved potassium bifluoride.  The majority of the fluorine is cooled by liquid nitrogen to remove residual hydrogen fluoride and potassium fluoride carried over from the electrolytic cells.  After these impurities are removed, the gas is compressed for distribution to the various fluorine users throughout the facility.\n\nThe hydrogen fluoride is also transfilled into smaller containers, or cylinders.  The hydrogen fluoride is brought on site by railcar that is placed inside a totally enclosed containment building for processing.  The hydrogen fluoride is then fed directly from the railcar to the fluorine plant or pumped into cylinders, which are stored and maintained on site for shipment to customers.  Additional railcars are stored outside of the building due to the increasing demand for the material.\n\nThis facility also re-packages anhydrous hydrogen chloride.  The hydrogen chloride is brought on site by railcar.  From the railcar, it is transferred through a series of heat exchangers and pumps to the tube trailers and cylinders.  Also, tube trailers and cylinder storage of hydrogen chloride are maintained.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is brought on site by tank truck and pumped into a stationary storage tank.  It is used as a raw material in the production of nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).  NF3 is made by introducing fluorine gas into ammonium bifluoride.  Ammonia is transferred under its own storage tank pressure, vaporized, and fed to t"

Anhydrous ammonia is also fed to a purification plant, where moisture is removed before it is re-packaged into other bulk containers.\n\nArsine cylinders are filled at another location and are only stored on our shipping/receiving area.  Cylinders of boron trichloride which contain residual product are received from other sites and re-packaged into A-5 containers for resale or disposal.\n\nThe regulated substances handled at this facility are fluorine, hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, anhydrous ammonia, arsine, and boron trichloride.  The maximum amount of these substances at this facility are:\n\ni??15,000 pounds of fluorine, of which 7300 pounds are stored in a separate location in mixtures of 25% (by weight) of fluorine in either nitrogen or helium\ni??690,000 pounds of hydrogen fluoride\ni??457,000 pounds of anhydrous hydrogen chloride, of which 87,000 pounds are stored in a separate location in tube trailers\ni??530,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia\ni??1500 pounds of arsine\ni??34,000 pounds of boron trichloride\n\n3.

The entire anhydrous chloride inventory of 155,000 pounds is assumed to be released and to vaporize.

For anhydrous hydrogen chloride, the ACS is the failure of a safety device on a single tube of a tube trailer, resulting in a release of 3000 pounds of hydrogen chloride over a 14-minute period.  The 14-minute release duration is the approximate time it takes for the tube to empty.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined toxic endpoint of 20 ppm for this ACS reaches receptors off-site.\n\nFor fluorine, the ACS is also a failure of a safety device on a single tube of an Airopak tube trailer.  This trailer contains a mixture of 25% (by weight) of fluorine in nitrogen.  Because of the larger orifice size in the tube safety device, the tube empties in less than a minute, releasing 270 pounds of fluorine in that time.  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint of 2.5 ppm for this ACS reaches receptors off-site.\n\nThe ACS for hydrogen fluoride is a leak in the distribution header.   About 1600 pounds of hydrogen fluoride would be released over a 8-minute period.  The duration is based on an operator pushing the emergency stop button that closes an air-operated valve on the car end of the liquid piping.  The remaining HF in the distribution piping would then continue to dump (even though the driving force would diminish once the stop button is hit). The maximum distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint of 20 ppm for this ACS reaches receptors off-site.\n\nThe ACS for anhydrous ammonia is a failure of the tank truck transfer hose.  About 5000 pounds of ammonia would be released over a 3-minute period.  The duration is based on a tank truck driver (always in attendance during the offload) pushing the emergency stop button that closes a valve on the truck end of the transfer hose.  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint of 200 ppm for this ACS does not reach any receptors off-site.\n\nThe ACS for arsine is a cylinder valve being sheared off if the cylinder were dropped during handling.

The maximum distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint of 0.3 ppm for this ACS does not reach any receptors off-site.\n\nThe ACS for boron trichloride is an A-5 cylinder valve being sheared off by a fork lift.  Approximately 40 pounds would be released over a period of 30 minutes, which is the amount of time it would take for the emergency response team to contain the release.  The maximum distance to the EPA-defined toxic endpoint of 0.01 mg/L for this ACS does not reach any receptors off-site.\n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps:\n\nThe facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPAi??s Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHAi??s Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n5.  Five-year accident history:\n\nThis facility came on line in March of 1973.  In the last five years, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of flammable or toxic gas that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6.  The emergency response program:\n\nEmployees that are members of the on-site emergency response team at the facility will respond to emergencies beyond initiating emergency response from outside agencies.  All on-site ER team members have undergone training in nearly all of the alternate case scenarios.  All facility employees have been trained to OSHAi??s HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level in order to identify the need for an initiated response.  Retraining is conducted annually.\n\nThe facility maintains an Emergency Procedure Manual that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release.
