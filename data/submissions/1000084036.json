      "SummaryText": "nt of aqueous ammonia (0.14 mg/L) was determined for the WCS release by using dispersion modeling. The off-site consequence was evaluated by quantifying the affected population and identifying the presence of public and environmental receptors affected by the releases. To determine the maximum distance outward within which the endpoints could be exceeded in the event of an accidental release (also known as the hazard impact distance), the USEPA's RMP*Comp software dispersion model was used. RMP*Comp is used to perform off-site consequence analysis required under USEPA's RMP Rule. The maximum distance to the endpoint for the worst-case release scenario was determined to be 0.3 mile. The results of the hazard area analysis were generated from MARPLOT. The results of the dispersion modeling analysis showed that there are no public receptors within the hazard area, and therefore, the aqueous ammonia system qualifies for Program 1. Note that the Conemaugh River and some associated woodlands are located within the hazard area, but because this area is only subject to \"occasional hiking, camping, or hunting and fishing\" and does not receive regular recreational use, the area does not qualify as a public receptor."

      "SummaryText": "Conemaugh Generating Station (Conemaugh) is a coal-fired, electric power generating station located in New Florence, Pennsylvania. The facility previously utilized anhydrous ammonia as a flue gas conditioner to improve the efficiency of the electrostatic precipitators. The anhydrous ammonia system was removed on October 26, 2012. The anhydrous ammonia process was subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) standard, and therefore, had to meet the requirements of Section 112(r), Risk Management Plan (RMP). Aqueous ammonia (29.4 percent) is currently used by this facility in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system. This is accomplished by injecting a 29 percent ammonia solution into the flue gas before it is passed over a catalyst. Four 66,700-gallon tanks of aqueous ammonia located in the southeast corner of the facility (east of the Flue Gas Desulfurization building), are used to store the aqueous ammonia. The facility is no longer covered under the OSHA PSM standard. However, the facility is still subject to RMP requirements for the use of the aqueous ammonia, although the facility is now considered a Program 1 facility. Program 1 is applicable to any process that has not had an accidental release with off-site consequences in the five years prior to the submission date of the RMP and has no public receptors within the distance to a specified toxic or flammable endpoint associated with a worst-case scenario (WCS) release. The aqueous ammonia system at Conemaugh has not had an accidental release in the past five years. There are no public receptors within the toxic endpoint distance associated with a WCS release from the aqueous ammonia system. Therefore, the aqueous ammonia process is subject to the requirements of RMP Program 1.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous ammonia injection system at Conemaugh is designed to remove nitrogen oxides from boiler flue gas by SCR. This is accomplished by injecting a 29 percent ammonia s"

The aqueous ammonia storage is comprised of four 66,700-gallon storage tanks, pumps, piping, instrumentation, and controls. Administrative controls are used to ensure that the tanks are not filled above the 90 percent level. To be conservative, it was assumed that the tanks are 100 percent full to determine the maximum quantity on site and the WCS release. The maximum quantity on site was determined from the four 66,700-gallon tanks that store 29 percent aqueous ammonia. The maximum quantity of aqueous ammonia on site is 266,800 gallons, equivalent to 2,000,000 lbs. All four 66,700-gallon tanks are connected to a common header at the forwarding pipe skid. The storage tanks are in a concrete diked area for secondary containment. Tanker-truck unloading is also provided with secondary containment. The storage tanks are equipped with a number of safety devices including relief valves, pressure gauges, liquid level gauge, excess flow valve, and emergency shutoff valves. The remaining components of the system are also equipped with appropriate safety devices.\r\n \r\nThe WCS assumes that two of the four 66,700 gallon tanks of aqueous ammonia (29.4%) are released into the secondary containment area. To be conservative, the WCS quantity released assumes the tanks are calculated at 100% capacity.  The total quantity released under the WCS is 999,078 lb. The WCS can include the effects of passive mitigation systems, and for the Conemaugh aqueous ammonia system, this includes the use of secondary containment to minimize ammonia liquid spills. Because the horizontal surface area of the secondary containment system (4,876 ft2) is less than that of the worst-case liquid pool (no secondary containment, one-centimeter-deep pool), the rate at which the material was released is calculated as 177 lb/min.\r\n\r\nThe maximum distance to the toxic endpoi"
