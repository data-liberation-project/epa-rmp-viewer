A Safety and Risk Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals.  This site has developed and trained an Emergency Response Team to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies.  The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect BC Systems employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \n1.2.\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\nThe BC Systems plant covered by this RMP is located at 16411 9th Street, Huron, California. The facility receives lettuce and other produce to be processed, packaged for consumer use in various salad mixes, set for short-term storage, and transported and distributed from this site.\nThe regulated substance is anhydrous ammonia.  Three portable ammonia refrigeration systems are used for refrigerating produce at various temperatures. The total charge to this refrigeration system is 8,340 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  \n1.3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nPrevention of accidental ammonia release at BC Systems is accomplished through the following:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tsound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction\n\u00c2\u00bf\tspecification and review of system modifications\n\u00c2\u00bf\tday-to-day operation and maintenance of the system  \nDay-to day operation and maintenance includes:\n\u00c2\u00bf\tCompliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification\n\u00c2\u00bf\tPerformance of a thorough hazard review at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information\n\u00c2\u00bf\tImplementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed as part of the hazard review process\n\u00c2\u00bf\tAppropriate initia"
