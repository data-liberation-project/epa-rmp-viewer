If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local emergency response personnel to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFACILITY INFORMATION\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for sale to farmers.\n-The maximum quanitity stored would be 470,000 pounds.\n\nWORST CARE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATICE RELEASE CASE SCENARIO\n     The worst case release of anhydrous ammonia would be the release from the largest vessel identified as holding 130,000 pounds liquidfied under pressure by design standards.  By using RMP Comp it was determined that release of this would meet the endpoint of  6.9 miles.  The impact would be on residents of about 450.  Alternative release of 100 lbs. of ammonia would affect aprroximately 4 people.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n     The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, J-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institutes, Inc. and the standards of OSHA, 29 CFR 1910-111, \"Storage and Handlings or anhydrous ammonia\".\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\n     It was found that there have been no accidents or reportable off-premises release at this facility.  The emergency responses program is on file with Local Emergency Planning Coordinator.  Safety improvement is an ongoing process at this facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions."
