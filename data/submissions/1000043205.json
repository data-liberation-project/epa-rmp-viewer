This updated, five (5) year Risk Management Plan (RMP) summarizes the management, administrative, procedural, and technological controls that work together to minimize the risk to site personnel, contractors, visitors, and the community and environment at large of hazardous chemical releases. The RMP is organized to correspond with specific U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) RMP, Program 3 of 40 CFR 68, definitions and requirements of Subpart G, including: \r\n\u00bf\tIntroduction;\r\n\u00bf\tNation Pizza Products policies to protect health, environment, and safety;\r\n\u00bf\tFacility identification and regulated substances covered processes;\r\n\u00bf\tHazard Assessment;\r\n\u00bf\tPrevention Program;\r\n\u00bf\tFive-Year Accident History;\r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Response Plan; \r\n\u00bf\tEmergency Communications;\r\n\u00bf\tSpill Reporting / Environmental Release Procedures;\r\n\u00bf\tPlanned changes to improve safety; and\r\n\u00bf\tManagement Program\r\n\r\nII.\tNation Pizza Products Policies To Protect Health, Environment, and Safety\r\nRisk management and safety are important concerns at Nation Pizza Products; this RMP formalizes and documents these activities.

There are two (2) refrigeration systems onsite that are used for refrigerating pizza products. \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #1 is approximately 13,000 pounds.  Refrigeration system #1 is used to cool production rooms, holding freezers, cheese cooler, glycol chiller, and a frigo blast freezer.  This system is a two-stage system with four (4) high stage compressors and two (2) booster compressors.  Evaporators in the production areas are fed with high pressure pumped liquid from the receiver, the holding freezer evaporators are fed from the intercooler at 32 psi, and the frigo blast freezer is fed pumped liquid at 30 psi from another intercooler.                                                    \r\n\r\nThe amount of ammonia currently present in the refrigeration system #2 is approximately 32,000 pounds.
