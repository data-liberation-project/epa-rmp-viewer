      "SummaryText": "OVERVIEW\r\nAir Liquide Large Industries, L.P. (Air Liquide) operates a hydrogen recovery and purification unit (HPU) process in Freeport, Texas.  The HPU is considered the covered process, as defined in the accidental release prevention regulations, having a flammable mixture in the process in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The HPU process involves recovering and purifying byproduct hydrogen from various host processes.  The purified hydrogen is then exported to end user customers via a hydrogen pipeline.  The hydrogen purification process is closely monitored and controlled to prevent accidental releases to the environment.  Air Liquide's commitment to safety and environmental protection must extend beyond its gates.  As part of the community, we have a responsibility to our customers and to those who live in the surrounding area.  Through safety, concern for the environment, and community involvement, we can develop a true partnership with our customers and neighbors.\r\n\r\nRegulated Chemical\r\nThe HPU process is designed to provide an efficient production of high purity hydrogen product using various byproduct feedstocks.  Purified hydrogen is sold to industrial customer(s).  The Freeport HPU is designed for continuous operation and is designed for inherently safe operation.\r\n\r\nHydrogen Purification Process \r\nHydrogen purification is a recovery and purification process using various hydrogen rich streams as feedstock.  The purification process takes place under elevated pressure.  The process has two sub-processes, each set up to purify the incoming byproduct hydrogen to meet pipeline quality specification as suitable for end customer.  The Grade 1 by product feedstock is near pure hydrogen stream, which is washed, filtered, compressed and then passed through an adsorption step to remove trace impurities.  The Grade 2 byproduct stream, a 70% hydrogen stream, is compressed and passed through a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit to concentrate and purify the hydrogen s"

The remainder of the Grade 2 stream rejected by the PSA, a primarily methane and other light hydrocarbon mix, is recovered and sent back to the host to be used as fuel.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\r\nAir Liquide's Freeport HPU is covered by EPA's accidental release prevention program regulations and is subject to OSHA's process safety management (PSM) standard.  The flammability of some of the chemicals in the process makes it necessary for Air Liquide to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human and environmental exposure and to reduce the potential threat to personnel and nearby members of the community.  Air Liquide's policy is to comply with all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The summary below discusses some of the management system in place to implement the accidental release prevention program.\r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\r\nAir Liquide keeps a variety of technical documents onsite and in the company's electronic document control system (SMARTSOLVE) that are used to help maintain safe operation of its processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, equipment design/configuration information, specific chemical inventories and operation limits for key process parameters - all key information for operating the process safely.  Process operators are trained to operate the process using process controls and instrumentation within these operating limits.\r\n\r\nThe Plant Manager is responsible for maintaining up-to-date process safety information.  A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan described below.  \r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\nAir Liquide has a risk management program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and control.

The PHA team consists of members with the appropriate experience to define the hazards and mitigating controls of the process and also represents a cross-section of the employees working in the process.  For upcoming PHA reviews, local and corporate management will review the PHA team findings and develop a resolution action plan for each item, which will be documented, tracked and ultimately closed in the Air Liquide action item database tracking system (SIMON).  The Freeport HPU manager is responsible for prioritizing and tracking implementation of the action plan.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures\r\nAir Liquide maintains written procedures that address various modes of hydrogen purification process operations, such as (1) unit initial startup; (2) unit normal and temporary operations; (3) unit shutdown; (4) emergency shutdown; (5) startup following an emergency shutdown; and (6) process deviation, consequence and action.  These procedures are used by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nAir Liquide has implemented a training program for all employees involved in operating the hydrogen purification process.  All employees receive a combination of classroom, computer-based training (CBT) and hands-on training that addresses such topic as: general orientation, site rules and practices, process safety information, normal and emergency operating procedures, health and safety consideration, use of safety procedures and equipment, incident investigation and emergency response.

Freeport HPU maintains communication with the Dow Oyster Creek Emergency Response to ensure that that they are familiar with the facility's EAP.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \r\nThe Air Liquide Freeport HPU resolves the findings of its PHA and other hazard reviews some of which result in modifications of the process.   Most recently Air Liquide increased staff to enhance safety and reliability.  The increased staff adds greater flexibility to cover normal day to day operations and increase operator participation in design hazard and other management reviews."
