Since this facility is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (promulgated in 1992), these program elements have been in place for many years, which essentially mirror the prevention program requirements of EPA's Risk Management Program (RMP) rule.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe HF Sinclair Woods Cross Refining LLC's Woods Cross Refinery is located approximately 10 miles north of Salt Lake City, Utah. The primary function of the refinery is to convert various crude oils into marketable products, including various grades of gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, propane, and asphalt. This facility has a rated processing capacity of 31,000 barrels a day of crude oil.\n\nHollyFrontier Corporation purchased the refinery from Phillips Petroleum Company on June 1, 2003. Over the past 50 years, extensive additions and improvements to the refinery have been made, including numerous safety and environmentally related processes.\n\nHollyFrontier Corporation acquired Sinclair to form HF Sinclair Corporation on March 14, 2022. \n\nHF Sinclair Woods Cross Refining LLC's Woods Cross Refinery is co-located with Woods Cross Operating LLC which owns three process units within the Woods Cross refinery: Unit 24 Crude Unit; Unit 25 FCC; and Unit 26 Poly Unit. Woods Cross Operating LLC's facility is owned by Holly Energy Partners LLC and is a separate stationary source covered under a separate Risk Management Plan.\n\nThere are several RMP regulated chemicals at the refinery produced as either process intermediates or finished products. RMP regulated flammable substances are generally mixtures of gases/gas liquids including methane, ethane, ethylene, propylen"

The only two regulated toxic chemicals onsite above the threshold quantity (TQ) is Hydrofluoric (HF) Acid and Aqua Ammonia. While regulated flammable mixtures can be found in most refining processes, HF Acid is only present in alkylation unit and Aqua Ammonia is present in unit 22 and unit 68.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE/CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nProcess Safety Information (PSI)\n\nThe Woods Cross Refinery maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to maintain safe operation of the processes. Written PSI provides employees with a baseline of information to identify hazards of the chemicals used or produced in the process, information about the technology of the process, and information about the equipment in the process. This process information provides a foundation for performing the unit Process Hazards Analysis, developing operating procedures and determining applicability, in some cases, for the need for management of change.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nA process hazards analysis is a systematic and methodical study to identify and analyze the significance of potential hazards associated with the processing and handling of highly hazardous chemicals. A PHA provides information to Refinery management and employees in making decisions for improving the safety and reducing the consequences of undesirable and/or unplanned releases of highly hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study Technique) methodology was used for performing all PHA's at the Woods Cross Refinery. Each unit process is divided into small sections, referred to as \"nodes\". Each node is studied using a series of guide words representing deviations from normal operations (e.g., no flow, reverse flow, more flow, less flow). The causes for each deviation are recorded and considered for potential effects. Existing safeguards are"

The findings from the HAZOP, which are reviewed by refinery management for final acceptance and assignment. \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures provide instructions for safely and consistently conducting activities involved in the operations of a process unit. Copies of the Operating Procedures manuals are available to employees at all control rooms, as well as various office locations.  Written procedures address various operating modes, such as 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, and 6) consequences of deviation.\n\nOperating Procedures manuals have been developed for all operating units at the Woods Cross Refinery and are periodically reviewed and updated; they complement the existing \"Training Manuals\", which are more detailed in nature.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the Woods Cross Refinery has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process. Training modules developed for each operating unit primarily cover operating procedures, which include such topics as startup/shutdown, emergency procedures, safety precautions, etc. Written and practical tests are given to all participants after the training modules have been completed.\n\nRefresher training/certification is provided every three years to operations personnel on the operating units for which they are responsible. Training in safe work practices is given to all employees during new employee safety orientation, annual safety training sessions, special classes, and monthly safety meetings.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe intent of the mechanical integrity program is to provide a management system that promotes the long-term reliability of the Refinery processes and related equipment.

All critical equipment (listed under the six general types above) are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule. Deficiencies are corrected under the plant work order system.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nManagement of Change procedures require that proposed changes are reviewed before they are implemented to ensure that all safety-related concerns and issues are considered, and appropriate action is taken, prior to implementing the change. MOC procedures apply to any temporary or permanent change (except for \"replacement in kind\") to process chemicals, technology, equipment, or procedures that affect a covered process; this also includes changes to the general plant or facility that affect a covered process or impact offsite (i.e., \"public\") receptors.\n\nPre-startup safety review (PSSR)\n\nPre-startup safety reviews are performed to ensure that the appropriate process safety information requirements have been met, any new or modified equipment has been installed according to design specifications, appropriate safety and operating procedures are in place and applicable training has been given prior to start-up of new or modified facilities. A PSSR is generally conducted for all installations or modifications that require an MOC.\n\nCompliance audits\n\nAudits serve as a self-evaluation tool to measure compliance with the RMP rule and PSM standard and the effectiveness of the Company's implementation program.

A formal investigation will be made for all incidents which result in, or could have reasonably resulted in any of the following:\n\n- Catastrophic release of highly hazardous chemicals,\n- Any uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons or chemicals that requires an area/unit evacuation,\n- Any fire or explosion,\n- Recordable injury,\n- Spill or release >1 barrel or has the potential to travel offsite,\n- Significant property loss or business interruption,\n- Any other incident deemed appropriate by management.\n\nAll incident investigation reports are entered into a computer database for tracking purposes. Incident investigation reports are retained onsite for at least 5 years so that they can be reviewed during future PHA revalidations and/or included in RMP updates.\n\nEmployee participation\n\nThe intent of employee participation is to ensure that employees are involved in all key aspects in the development and implementation of risk management plans and related issues. Employees have access to all information developed to comply with the RMP rule and PSM standard. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents to participating as a member of a PHA team. The facility also has an employee-driven behavior-based safety observation program. This process is used to reduce \"at-risk\" behaviors, resulting in fewer unsafe acts and conditions.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Company has long-standing safe work practices that promote process safety.

These procedures, along with others, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed in a safe manner.\n\nContractors\n\nContract employees at the Woods Cross Refinery provide labor for general construction, turnaround work and various service-related jobs. While contractors are not involved in plant operations, their actions may have an influence on process safety. The Company informs contractors of fire, explosion, and toxic release hazards as well as its emergency response plan during site safety orientation, which all contractors are required to attend prior to working at this facility. In addition, contractors involved in maintaining the on-going integrity of process equipment receive \"Process Overview Training\". The contract employer will ensure that their employees are trained in (and follow) the work practices necessary to safely perform their job, including those specific to the Woods Cross Refinery. This may be accomplished through the use of periodic self-audits, safety meetings, training sessions, etc. The Company will also note compliance with safe work practices during its periodic audits of the contract employees.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Woods Cross Refinery has experienced two accidents in the prior five years involving a covered process that met the five-year accident reporting cr"

The first accident involved a failure of a small-bore pipe fitting at a PSV on the Crude Unit (Unit 8) that occurred on March 13, 2018, resulting in a release of crude into the air that settled on process unit surfaces and some offsite property to the north. The released crude ignited on a hot pump surface and flared into a larger fire, damaging several units of the refinery. The resulting fire caused significant onsite property damage and minor offsite environmental damage but no injuries or fatalities. The second accident occurred on November 1, 2018, and involved a contractor who cut into small-bore pipe during a maintenance activity in the HF Alky unit.  The line and bleeder contained a small amount of un-neutralized HF in the line which released to atmosphere when the line was inadvertently cut.  The contractor cutting the pipe was exposed to HF Acid vapors, treated for inhalation and skin burns on site, and was transported by ambulance to the hospital for further medical treatment.  \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe Woods Cross Refinery maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. The program, which is included in its Integrated Contingency Plan (ICP) manual, consists of procedures for responding to various emergencies, including chemical releases, fires, and explosions. There are four emergency response teams maintained at the refinery, which consist of volunteer employees: 1) Fire Brigade, 2) Hazmat Team, 3) Technical Rescue Team, and 4) Emergency First Responders (medical first aid). All team members receive initial and periodic refresher training. The Incident Command System (ICS) is used to manage all emergency response situations. The refinery is staffed by a shift superintendent on a 24 hours/day basis, who is the acting Incident Commander until relieved by one of the primary Incident Commanders.

The refinery emergency response teams periodically conduct drills and training exercises with members of the Mutual Aid organization as well as local Fire Departments.\nThe Company sponsors a CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency Response) Committee, which is comprised of local city officials and fire, police, and sheriff representatives. The CAER Committee meets bi-monthly to discuss citizen concerns about the refinery, emergency response efforts and other common, community issues. The Davis County LEPC (Local Emergency Planning Committee) chairman is a member of the CAER Committee.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nInitiatives for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees through the employee participation plan. Employee safety meetings that focus on chemical safety issues are held regularly at the refinery. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to reduce the potential risks of those hazards.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted with key employees to meet the PSM/RMP requirements. During these sessions, employees make recommendations for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. All recommendations are considered by management for implementation. Though not all recommendations may be implemented, all are considered.  This exercise has provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.\n                                          \n\nADDITIONAL EMERGENCY CONTACTS\n\nShift Superintendent (24 hour coverage) 801-541-6531\nLEPC Coordi"
