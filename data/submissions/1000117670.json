We are dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for everyone we touch through innovative food and agricultural products. Operations at the Perdue Foods Lewiston Complex consist of a poultry processing plant(P-9197), wellness center, vehicle maintenance area, and wastewater treatment facility. The operation is located at 3539 Governor's Road, Highway 308 West in Lewiston, North Carolina. Perdue Farms Incorporated began operations at this facility on February 26, 1976. The facility is located in a rural setting surrounded by farmland and residences which include a public school.\n\nCHEMICAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nAs a concerned member of the communities in which Perdue facilities are located, the company takes it role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously. All Perdue facilities are operated to protect employees, contractors, and the public from injury and illness, and to minimize environmental impact. A company-wide safety and wellness program stresses safe working conditions and safe work practices. Perdue's policy is to inspect, maintain, and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents, including the release of hazardous materials; and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur. Perdue Farms has developed and implemented Spill Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) and Process Safety Management (PSM) plans at each operations facility as part of an overall chemical management program. The program involves a wide range of senior management personnel, including the Vice- President of Environmental Services and the Director of Safety and Security. Additionally, Perdue Farms conducts regular safety meetings and provides a wide range of environmental, health, and safety training to its staff.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES"

This commitment is demonstrated by a comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE and the REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED\nThe primary activity associated with this facility is poultry processing. There is one regulated substance present at the facility. This substance is anhydrous ammonia. Ammonia is used within our compressor rooms and related equipment for product refrigeration and cooling. The maximum inventory of ammonia at the facility is 87,163 pounds.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM and CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\nThe facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth under 40 CFR Part 68. This facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 29CFR 1910.119. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at the stationary source.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no accidents involving the accidental release of a regulated substance that have resulted in death, injury, property damage, public evacuation, environmental damage, or sheltering in place.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN\nLewiston maintains a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. To ensure proper functioning, the emergency response equipment is regular"

In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response. The Bertie County Emergency Manager is the head of the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified. Perdue Farms also coordinates activities pertaining to emergency response with the local fire departments and the North Carolina Regional Response Team 1 located in Williamston, North Carolina.\n\nRMP COMMUNICATIONS PLAN\nAs part of its Risk Management Program, Perdue Farms has developed an RMP Communications Plan. The goals of this plan are (1) to educate the public on the potential risk of regulated substances used by Perdue; (2) to respond to any concerns that RMP disclosures may cause with honest, fact-based communication; and (3) to be fully prepared to effectively respond to any accidental chemical release scenario. Proactive materials about the disclosure of information, how the company is prepared to deal with an accident, how the community should respond to an accident, and a process for announcing that an accident has occurred to the public have been prepared. In addition, training and information materials for Perdue managers and employees, community officials, civic groups, the media, environmental groups, emergency response personnel, and the public in general will be available.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of the accidental release, prevention program. Perdue Farms Incorporated has installed ammonia detection in conjunction with the exhaust fans located in the compressor rooms and such equipment as auto purgers, in order to minimize exposure of the facility personnel during a release.
