      "SummaryText": "The farmer owners, management and employees of the  Farmers Cooperative Association are committed and dedicated to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is the unlaoding from truck, anhydrous ammonia, into our storage tanks and then to transfer from storage tanks into nurse tanks.  These nurse tanks are used by our farmer customers to apply nitrogen to their crops.   Our Ammonia facility stores at maximium 234100  pounds, of anhydrous ammonia in a 11000 gallon and a 26000 gallon storage tank and 15 nurse tanks. Total volume figured by water capacity at 85% with a density of 5.5 lbs/gallon NH3.\n\nThe worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quanity released would be 131,000 pounds, which represents the volume of our largest tank at 85% capacity, as limited by design standards.  The Local and County Emergency Management have been trained on how to react to a release.\nThe alternative release scenario based on industry records and the most likely potentail incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  \n\nBecause our firm handels anhydrous ammonia, we are regulated by DOT, EPA, OSHA, and The Kansas Department of Agriculture, who inspects our facilities on an annual basis.  These regulation along with the extensive training and standards our company uses, has led us to an excellent safety record.  We have had reportable accidents with annhydrous ammonia in the last five years.  We are very proud of this record.  In the event we would have an ammonia release  we have an emergency response plan which discusses what our personnel are to do.  In addition the training our employees are required to have ,"
