      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\n\n\n\nCalumet Karns City Refining LLC (Calumet) is a manufacturer of high purity specialty oils often used in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications.\n\n\n\nA review of the RMP regulation has indicated that Oleum, with 20% free sulfur trioxide, is the only chemical used in a process at the site, at any one time, in quantities above the RMP threshold applicability level. This chemical is used in the white oil oleum process. A Worst-Case Scenario review was performed with the ALOHA dispersion model. The results indicated that a potential release of oleum could not affect offsite receptors under release conditions mandated by the RMP rule. The area potentially impacted also does not contain any sensitive receptors. Therefore, the facility qualifies for Program Level 1 compliance in accordance with the RMP regulation. No offsite population or sensitive receptors are within the zone of influence (toxic endpoint) as defined by the EPA.\n\n\n\nCalumet is committed to maintaining comprehensive accident prevention and emergency response programs which meet and/or exceed all federal and state requirements. Injury and Incident Free is the Calumet safety and environmental principle. The company's environmental, safety and health policy is summarized in the following paragraph.\n\n\n\nProtecting the environment and the safety and health of employees, customers, contractors, communities, and the public is fundamental to the way Calumet conducts its business. To integrate environmental, safety, and health management into business activities, Calumet will:\n\n\n\n1.    Pursue excellence in the design, construction, operation, and restoration of all properties and facilities;\n\n2.    Be a responsible steward of all products and services;\n\n3.    Train and prepare employees for emergencies and other contingencies;\n\n4.    Communicate openly regarding business activities;\n\n5.    Assign clear responsibilities to all employees and contractors;\n\n6.    Provide employees with resources and training to "

      "SummaryText": "meet assigned responsibilities;\n\n7.    Assess the potential risks of business activities;\n\n8.    Comply with all applicable laws and regulations;\n\n9.    Participate in the development of new laws, regulations, and technologies;\n\n10.    Review performance and communicate progress; and\n\n11.    Expect continuous improvement.\n\n\n\nThe Calumet facility, located in Karns City, Pennsylvania handles one chemical above the threshold quantity listed in the Risk Management Plan regulation. Specifically, Oleum is stored in an aboveground storage tank above the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is determined to be a failure of the oleum aboveground storage tank. Since the facility is only an RMP Program Level 1, an alternate release scenario was not required or developed. Mitigation measures to control the release include a concrete dike six feet in height that would be capable of containing > 100% of the volume of the storage tank. Further, the tank is located approximately in the geographic center of the Calumet facility (not at the property border). Calumet is prepared to handle a worst-case release by training its emergency responders in Hazwoper Level 3, 40 CFR, Section 1910.120.\n\n\n\nPrevention steps include a strict inspection schedule, the implementation of numerous procedures, and carefully observing Process Safety Management guidelines.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidents at Calumet in the past five years involving the regulated substance that meet the criteria outlined in 40 CFR, Part 68.42.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive emergency response program/plan has been developed and is regularly used to train both in-house and local area responders. \n\n\n\n"
