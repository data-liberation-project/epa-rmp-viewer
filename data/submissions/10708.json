BP management strongly supports \nProcess Safety Management  and the Risk Management Program and recognizes it as a good business \npractice as well as a good approach to protecting workers and the public from industrial operation hazards.  \nBP Chemicals Green Lake applies the basic principles of Process Safety Management  and the Risk \nManagement Program to all applicable processes.

The following \nparagraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nToxics\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n\nThe worst case submitted involves a catastrophic release from a full Crude (Off-Spec) atmospheric storage \ntank containing 8.1% Hydrocyanic Acid in the Acrylonitrile manufacturing process. This is conservative \ndue to the Hydrocyanic Acid being calculated as a pure component.  It is assumed that the entire quantity is \nreleased into a dike, which vaporizes and moves downwind. Under worst case weather conditions **, this \nscenario has offsite impacts corresponding to the endpoint indicated in the EPA Tables. For this scenario \nthe planned emergency response would be to have water sprays and foam the diked area to minimize \ndownwind effects and fire and explosion potential.
