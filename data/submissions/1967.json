The summary contains general information that is common to all affected facilities as well as facility specific data.  This approach offers an overall perspective of the utility operation while providing the facility specific information required for each of the plans.  Our purpose is to make it as convenient as possible for the reader of any of the four plans to have pertinent information regarding MPW's regulated substances program rather than information about only one of its facilities. \n\nAccidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n       Management's commitment to safety is stated in the MPW Strategic Plan overall planning philosophies that include promoting a safe working environment.  Two examples of implementing this philosophy are the Safety Incentive Program and Accident Review Team.  The Safety Incentive Program encourages total employee involvement in, and commitment to safety and health by recognizing and awarding employees who meet utility-wide safety goals. The Accident Review Team is a voluntary group of employees who review accident reports, investigate specific situations, and make recommendations to correct safety problems. More s"

      "SummaryText": "pecifically, this safety philosophy is exemplified in an accidental release prevention policy utilizing an approach that combines management strategies with technological controls and operating procedures.  Management strategies include minimizing the amount and types of hazardous chemicals used/stored at the Generation Station. Operating procedures include hazard awareness training, and having emergency response plans to address accidental releases from each of the specific facilities.  Technological controls include automated safety valves and vacuum operation of chlorine injection systems.      \n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled\n       MPW is a municipal water, electric and communications utility.  The utility serves the city of Muscatine, Iowa (population 23,000) and certain adjacent surrounding areas.  Regulated substances addressed by this plan are used at the MPW Generation Station and three drinking water treatment facilities. The two chemicals included in the Risk Management Plan are chlorine (Cl2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).   Both chemicals are used for water treatment.  Chlorine is used as a biocide and disinfectant.  Sulfur dioxide is used for dechlorination.  A list of the facilities with associated quantities of chemicals is shown in Table 1.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Table 1.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                     FACILITIES HOUSING RMP REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n             "

This release affected an area within a 0.9 mile endpoint that contained an estimated residential population of 232 individuals.\n\n       The \"alternative scenario\" for chlorine is a leak from flexible pipe.  When the release occurs inside a building at a rate of 8.4lbs./min. for 120 minutes, the 1,012 pounds released affect an area with an end point of 0.1 miles.  None of the estimated residential population would be affected by this release.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                    The same \"alternative scenario\" was used for sulfur dioxide.   The 3.5lb./min. release rate inside a building for 120 minutes produced 425 pounds.  The results are the same as those for chlorine.  The area affected has an endpoint of 0.1 miles, and none of the estimated residential population is affected.\n \nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n       The MPW general accidental release prevention program incorporates the following elements:Comprehensive training including practical exercises.Utilization of experienced operating personnel including Lab Technicians (who operate the cooling water   treatment system) and Water Production Operators (who operate the drinking water treatment facilities).A computerized maintenance management system to schedule and document preventive maintenance.Utilization of safety oriented and effective operating procedures that were developed with participation of the operators.Preparation of a hazard review of equipment and procedures.\n       Chemical specific release prevention steps consist of implementing procedure"

Response personnel, who are primarily familiar with certain facilities, are oriented and cross-trained at the facilities with which they are less familiar.   Hazard awareness training, utilization of PPE, and availability cylinder repair kits instills confidence in system operators.  For example, wearing an SCBA and using the buddy system whenever making cylinder connections is less stressful.   Equipment precautions include release detectors and chemical injection systems that operate under a vacuum.\n\nFive-year Accident History\n       No accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide have occurred from the facilities identified in this plan during the past five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\n       MPW employs an Incident Command System (ICS) to manage emergency responses.  The ICS establishes a specific structure for the multiple, simultaneous activities necessary to successfully control a hazardous materials incident.  This approach provides for a single person to be in charge of an incident.  That person, identified as the On Scene Incident Commander (OIC) is responsible for the overall management of the incident and setting the goals and objectives at the scene.  Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the incident, the OIC adds additional command staff positions such as a Safety Officer, Hazard Sector, Medical Support Sector, Plant Site/Security Control, Environmental, and Public Relations.\n\n       The procedures for implementing the previously described approach are contained in the MPW 29 CFR 1910.120(q) HAZWOPER Emergency Response Plan that the utility drafted.  This plan was prepared as a parent document into which other, already existing, chemical specific plans could be incorporated.  The utility has chemical specific emergency response plans for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  These plans establish procedures, assign responsibilities, identify assembly areas, address shelter/evacuation of the general public, explain"

Response planning has been coordinated with the local fire department that is hazmat trained and a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC).   A coordinated training exercise was held with the Muscatine Fire Department in 1998.\n                                                                                                                                                                        Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n       Several activities during the past few years have already enhanced the safety of using these chemicals and another measure will be implemented.  Recent activities eliminated old chlorination equipment, centralized chlorination/dechlorination, eliminated a marginally secure chlorination facility, established equipment preventative maintenance routines (PM's) and instituted routine inspections.  \n\n       A building housing chlorine cylinders and chlorination equipment for the two older generation units was abandoned and demolished.  Cooling water for these units is now handled by a central facility that serves all three units.  The old building was located in the Mississippi River levee adjacent to the units it served, but outside the station security fence.  The age/integrity of the building compromised security to some extent.  The current facility is in the secure area.\n\n       Preventive maintenance routines for equipment are initiated through the Generation Station computerized maintenance management system.  Equipment includes SCBA's, shower/eyewash stations, and chlorination system tubing and valves.\n\n        Weekly inspections of selected equipment are conducted and findings are documented.  Chlorine and sulfur dioxide sensor operation is verified and alarms are checked.  Building ventilating fan operation is also checked.\n\n       A facility audit and inspection program "
