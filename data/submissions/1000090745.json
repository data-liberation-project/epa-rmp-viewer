In order to maintain safe operations, the Refinery has had long-term control programs and procedures that are reviewed on a regular basis and updated to be current with facility operations and regulatory requirements. The Refinery uses both management controls and engineering controls to eliminate or reduce the risk of an accidental release.   Management controls are work procedures, safety policies, rules, supervision, and training implemented with the goal of reducing the possibility of an accidental release. Engineering controls eliminate or reduce the possibility of an accidental release through the use or substitution of engineered machinery or equipment.  The Refinery has the following management and engineering controls in place to minimize the possibility of an accidental release.\r\n\r\nManagement Controls\r\n\r\n- Employee Training and Certification for Compliance with Environmental, Safety, and Operations Regulations and Requirements\r\n- Emergency Response, Public Notification, and First Aid Training\r\n- Development of Standard and Emergency Operating Procedures\r\n- Contractor Training and Certification\r\n- Audits of Programs and Procedures to Prevent Releases of Hazardous Materials\r\n* Hazards Analyses of Process Equipment and Facilities\r\n* Standard and Emergency Operating Procedures\r\n* Operator Training Programs\r\n* Maintenance Procedures\r\n\r\n- Investment in Environmental Control and Safety Equipment and Systems\r\n* Process Controls to Ensure Proper Equipment Operation\r\n* Process Safety Systems to Prevent Uncontrolled Emissions of Hazardous Materials\r\n* Emergency Response Equipment to Control Fires and Emissions of Hazardous Materials\r\n* Emissions Monitori"

To improve emergency response the Refinery has a Facility Response Plan that describes how the Refinery responds to emergencies, including personnel, training, equipment, notifications, and contracted resources.  For spills of oil-containing liquids, the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plan presents the Refinery's plans and response resources.  These plans conform to Oil Pollution Prevention regulations at 40 CFR 112. These plans are designed to minimize hazards to human health, property and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden on non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents at the Refinery.\r\n\r\nStationary Sources and RMP Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThis submission treats the Refinery as a single stationary source process for the production of petroleum fuels.  In the past 5 years the refinery has had one major change to equipment and/or processes.  In October 2013, the Refinery received a permit to make equipment modifications to allow the refinery to increase its annual crude throughput from 14,000 bpd to 20,000 bpd.  These modifications consisted of upgrades to existing refinery process equipment (heaters, towers, heat transfer"

None of the toxic materials is in a quantity sufficient to be considered by OSHA and EPA as a concern to the public from an accidental release except for hydrofluoric acid (HF)used to produce high-octane gasoline and anhydrous ammonia used in the SWAATS process.   Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is used as a catalytic agent in the HF Alkylation process for the production of gasoline from isobutane and olefins. Anhydrous ammonia is used in the SWAATS process to convert hydrogen sulfide gas to ammonium thiosulfate.\r\n\r\nHydrofluoric acid is highly corrosive to living tissue and can cause severe burns to skin, eyes, and the respiratory system, depending on the exposure concentration and exposure time. Inhalation can cause irritation, inflammation, and fluid accumulation of the lungs. Exposure can cause coughing, tearing, difficulty in breathing, tight chest, and salivation.  Symptoms can arise hours after exposure. HF can penetrate skin and cause loss of bone mass.  First aid requires immediate irrigation of exposed skin and subsequent application of calcium gluconate to neutralize the acid. Exposure to HF is immediately apparent at a concentration far lower than that which can cause health problems. This becomes an early warning to move to a safe upwind location.\r\n\r\nThe HF Alkylation process has been used for decades by the petroleum refining industry in the production of gasoline with few accidental releases.  Wyoming Refining has never had a significant release of hydrogen fluoride from the Alkylation unit and has had only one reportable incident or accident involving the Alkylation unit during the last five years.

      "SummaryText": "the event that a release of hydrogen fluoride is detected.  This emergency system mitigates the toxic effects of hydrogen fluoride gas by dissolving and diluting the hydrogen fluoride in sufficient water to prevent dispersion of the gas to the atmosphere. This system is tested weekly in summer months to assure reliable operation.\r\n\r\nThe total inventory of hydrogen fluoride in the Alkylation unit is 58,000 lb. This quantity is subdivided into 35,000 lb. in low pressure storage and 23,000 lb. contained under pressure in the alkylation reactor.  The two inventories are infrequently connected. The Refinery has procedures and equipment designed to mitigate a release of HF to the environment. These procedures include removal of all HF in high-pressure equipment to low pressure storage before any equipment is opened for maintenance.  In the event that an HF release is detected, the facilities can be deluged with water to dissolve and dilute virtually all of the released HF before it leaves the unit. The water deluge system will prevent upwards of 95% of the release hydrogen fluoride from being dispersed downwind.\r\n\r\nAnhydrous ammonia causes irritation and is corrosive to exposed tissues, but is only slightly flammable.  Anhydrous ammonia can cause severe burns to skin, eyes, and the respiratory system, depending on the exposure concentration and exposure time.   Inhalation of vapors may result in pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonitis.  Anhydrous ammonia is corrosive and irritating to the upper respiratory system and all mucous type tissue.  Depending on the concentration inhaled, it may cause burning sensations, coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, with eventual collapse.  Inhalation of excessive amounts affects the upper airway (larynx and bronchi) by causing caustic-like burning resulting in edema and chemical pneumonitis. If it enters into the deep lung, pulmonary edema will result.  Pulmonary edema and chemical pneumonitis are potentially fatal"

      "SummaryText": "conditions.  Anhydrous ammonia has a pungent odor and is lighter-than-air.\r\n\r\nThe SWAATS process converts ammonia and sulfide compounds in the refinery's sour water streams to ammonium thiosulfate which is a feedstock for the fertilizer industry.  The unit contains an anhydrous ammonia storage tank that supplies additional ammonia to the process in order to achieve the stoichiometric ratio of ammonia to sulfide required by the process.  The Refinery has procedures and equipment designed to mitigate a release of anhydrous ammonia to the environment.  Since anhydrous ammonia is very soluble in water, these procedures include the manning of fire hoses while off-loading the material into the storage tank. In the event of a release, the release point can be deluged with water to absorb the ammonia and mitigate the amount of material from being dispersed downwind.\r\n\r\nFlammable Materials at Wyoming Refining Company\r\n\r\nThe Refinery processes flammable materials as a matter of course. However, most equipment does not contain flammable material sufficient to pose a hazard to the public. The Refinery has four flammable materials in excess of RMP reporting thresholds: propane (C3H6), normal butane (C4H10), isobutane (iC4H10), butylenes (C4H8).  All four flammable materials are liquids in pressure storage, but will evaporate into the atmosphere in the event of a leak presenting possible fire and explosion hazards.  None of these compounds are toxic, but all can cause asphyxiation from oxygen displacement. Of these, isobutane has the greatest potential for offsite effects in the event of an accidental release.  Isobutane is stored in 1500 and 500 barrel pressure storage vessels. The liquefied gases are held in pressure storage with water sprinkler systems for fire control. Revisions to the sprinkler systems for the isobutane bullets were completed in 2006 to provide improved coverage.\r\n\r\nPrevention Program\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan 2009 re-submission for Wyoming Refining, Inc"

      "SummaryText": "., Newcastle, Wyoming complies with the EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) 40 CFR 68 as well as the OSHA Process Safety Management Program (PSM) 29 CFR 1910.119.  This submission treats the Refinery as a single process.  The Risk Management and Process Safety Management Programs for the Refinery are applied uniformly to each operating unit as refinery-wide accidental release prevention programs.\r\n\r\nThe Refinery is in compliance with both the RMP and PSM prevention programs and conducts reviews and updates of each program in order to certify and assure continuing compliance. Both programs require the Refinery to implement practices and procedures for accidental release prevention. These procedures include operator training and certification, standard operating and emergency operating procedures, emergency notifications, equipment maintenance and inspection procedures, process hazards analysis and hazards mitigation in equipment design and operation, management of changes to equipment, operating and maintenance procedures, emergency procedures, and emergency notification for additional public risk reduction. The Refinery must also adhere to recognized safe equipment design, materials design, and engineering standards. All of these elements of the Refinery risk management and release prevention programs are designed to limit the possibility of accidental releases of toxic or flammable materials and minimize effects of Refinery operations on the general public and its employees from injuries, fatalities, and property damages.\r\n\r\nRMP 5-year Accident History\r\n\r\nIn the past 5 years WRC has had three accidental releases of RMP chemicals stored on-site above the threshold quantity from a covered process unit as defined by 40 CFR part 68.42(a). All three releases were minor in nature, involving less than 1 pound of regulated substance, and did not result in any off-site impact or on-site equipment damage, but are reported since each accident resulted in minor injuries to an em"

      "SummaryText": "ployee.  All three accidents have been investigated and corrective actions have been implemented. \r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe refinery has emergency response plans that address all of the RMP pubic emergency response plan requirements for a release of toxic or flammable materials. Both the Refinery and the LEPC develop plans for a public response to such an emergency.  Emergency responses include public emergency notification, public evacuation or sequestration, as appropriate, and training of local police, fire, medical, and other emergency officials in handling, with trained Refinery personnel, a significant public emergency.  The Refinery also trains and equips its personnel to handle leaks and fires that can affect employees and the public. Refinery personnel are considered the most important element in controlling and mitigating the effects of a process release.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nThe Refinery will continue to review and modify, where necessary, its management and release prevention programs to limit the possibility of accidental releases of toxic or flammable materials and minimize effects of Refinery operations on the general public and its employees from injuries, fatalities, and property damages."
