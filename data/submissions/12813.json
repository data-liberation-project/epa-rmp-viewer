Within the program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\n\tThe CIT-CON Oil Corporation primarily uses the Hazards and Operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  Hazop analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering  expertise.  The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\n\tThe PHA team findings are forwarded to management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to a PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  The ranking helps ensure that potential accident  scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\tTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the CIT-CON Oil Corporation periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted on 5 years intervals a"

Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\tThe CITGO Petroleum Corporation Lake Charles Manufacturing Complex's Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operation such as (1) initial startup of a new unit, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) unit startup.  These procedures can be used as reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The procedures are maintained current by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the management of change process\n\nIn addition, the CIT-CON Oil Corporation maintains a key process parameter documents which provides guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for specific process or equipment parameters.  This information, along with the written operating procedures is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks. \n\n\nTraining\n\n\tTo complement the written procedures for process operations, CIT-CON Oil Corporation has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New employees receive basic training in the facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process specific duties and tasks.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the facility has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) Have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work or may introduce in the course of performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview,  (2) information about safety & health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices before beginning their work.  In addition, the CIT-CON Oil Corporation evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre Startup Review\n\n\tThe CIT-CON Oil Corporation conducts a Pre Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modifications that requires a change in the process safety information.
