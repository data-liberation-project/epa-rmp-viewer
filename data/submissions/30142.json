The hazard assessment, prevention program, and emergency response plan were reviewed and updated before submittal of the current Risk Management Plan.

Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nThe City of Port Neches Water Treatment Plant uses chlorine in the treatment process, which is considered hazardous by the EPA.  The same properties that make chlorine an effective chemical for disinfecting raw surface water also make it necessary to exercise certain precautions in the handling of chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure.  The Water Treatment Plant operators use chlorine-handling procedures that are designed to reduce the threat to themselves and their co-workers, and to reduce the threat to members of the surrounding community.  It is the policy of the City of Port Neches to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety is dependent on the manner in which chlorine is handled, the design of the chlorine feed process, and the training of the operators in safe handling procedures.\n\nThe Operator\u00bfs emergency response training for the Water Treatment Plant is based on the Chlorine Institute\u00bfs EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLANS FOR CHLORINE FACILITIES, Edition 4, November 1995.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for notification of the Port Neches Fire Department (PNFD), and any potentially affected neighbors within the affected toxic endpoint radius calculated by the RMP*Comp software.\n\n\n4.

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\nThe purpose of the Risk Management Plan contained herein is to detect and prevent or minimize accidental releases of chlorine from the Water Treatment Plant, and to provide a prompt emergency response to any such releases in order to protect human health and the environment.  The City of Port Neches Water Plant incorporates safety training every 6 months to update the Water Treatment Plant\u00bfs Emergency Response Plan. \n2. The City of Port Neches Water Treatment Plant:\n\nThe City of Port Neches owns and operates a surface water treatment plant located on the corner of Park Street and Avenue D in Port Neches, Texas (No official US Post Office address is available).  The plant uses chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (and other chemicals not listed in 40 CFR 68.130) in the water treatment process.  The Risk Management Program for the plant considers toxic release scenarios only.  There are no flammables stored or used on-site that are considered a regulated substance according to the guidelines of 40 CFR 68.\n\nChlorine\n\nChlorine is delivered in DOT 106A500X 1-ton containers from a local chemical supplier.  The maximum quantity of chlorine present at any given time at the plant is 10,000 pounds.  The 1-ton containers are stored in an enclosed structure.  Chlorine is included in the City\u00bfs Risk Management Program because the on-site quantity exceeds the threshold limit listed in 40 CFR 68.130.  \n\nThe maximum quantity of chlorine used on-line in the chemical feed process is 4,000 pounds.  It is the policy of the City of Port to have a maximum of two 1-ton chlorine containers connected to the chemical feed process at any given time. \n\nAnhydrous Ammonia\n\nA local chemical supplier delivers anhydrous ammonia to an on-site 500-gallon tank.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored on-site at any given time is 2,335 pounds. Anhydrous ammonia is not included in the City\u00bfs Risk Management Program"
