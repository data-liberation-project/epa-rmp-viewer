In addition,we have\ncoordinated with local fire department to respond to energencies.\n             We have analuzed the worst-case release scenario defined by the EPA COMP,this scenario\ninvolves a vapor cloud release of the entire contents of a 12,000 gal storage. The information reflects\na distance of four miles from our facility. This scenario would be highly unlikely that it would ever occur.\n\n\nThe most likely would be an event of a hose break caused by a pull away or rupture of a hose. In this\ncase scenario would reflect a release that would affect up to .5 mile. In this case it would not impact any \nschools,hospitals or parks in any distance or scenario."
