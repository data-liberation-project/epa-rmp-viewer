It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent potential releases of regulated substances. Our primary activities are Health and Beauty Products. The regulated process involve the manufacture of hair mousses and feminine deodorant spray. Isobutane and Dymel are used as dispersants for the products.\n\nThe plant has  two regulated substances, both flammables: A-31 Isobutane (Propane, 2 methyl) and Dymel (a mixture of isobutane, propane and difluoroethane). LPG cylinders are also used. The regulated substances are flammables used in the process. The LPG is used to fuel a flare control system for the process. There are two storage tanks of 18,000 gallons each to store Isobutane and Dymel. Only one tank is used at a time for the process. A maximum of 6- 239 lbs of LPG cylinders are stored in the facility, with one LPG cylinder in line with the flare pilot.  In February 2003, the propelant used in the  manufacture of mousses (A-46, a mixture of Isobutane and Propane) was changed to Dymel. Isobutane is used for the manufacture of FDS, feminine deodorant spray. \n\nTo evaluate the worst case scenario Isobutane was used as it represented the substance with the highest heat of combustion. The release quantity was limited to 85% of 18,000 gallons as administrative control.  The distance to an over pressure of 1 psi was determined at 0.4 miles from the source using RMP comp.  As alternate scenario an escape from a  one inch diameter hole in the tank produces a vapor cloud which migrates and a spark ignites it at the LFL and produces a vapor cloud explosion. The distance to an overpressure of 1 psi using RMP comp was 0.1 mile. Same results were obtained using Dymel as the flammable involved in the explosion.\n\nThe facility is subject to OSHA PSM and so it qualifies for Program 3 processes. The facility is in compliance with OSHA PSM rule. Although the propellants gave same resu"

      "SummaryText": "lts using worst case and alternative scenarios, the PHA and all the PSM requisites were updated. Backup systems were revised, some additional ones (portable OVA analyzer) were recommended, operating procedures will be updated, training was updated and maintenance procedures were revised.   \n\nThere has not been any accidental release in the last five years previous to the submission of this RMP that has resulted in serious onsite or offsite impacts.\n\nThe facility has an Emergency Action Plan. It  is in compliance with EPCRA requirements and so the SERC, the LEPC and the local Fire Dept have information on the hazardous substance stored and used and included this information in the State Emergency Response Plan.  An Emergency Response Plan was prepared for the facility to comply with Program 3 processes and will be fully implemented in the next six months. Training has been updated and drills with the local fire department will be coordinated.\n\nChanges have been planned to improve safety. Some of these are:  the use of a portable OVA analyzer or explosimeter  in daily inspections to transfer lines and during loading/unloading, update training program and schedule, coordinating drills with local fire department, and  updating  operating procedures."
