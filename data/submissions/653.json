Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe purpose of this plan is to prevent or minimize the consequences of a catastrophic release of chlorine at the Coronado Generating Station (CGS) and surrounding areas.  This plan has also been developed to comply with the '40CFR 68 Subpart G.\n\nB. Regulated Substances\n\nChlorine is a member of the halogen family.  Some chemical and physical properties of chlorine as listed below:\nCAS # 007782-50-5\nAmber liquid under pressure\nGreenish-yellow gas under atmospheric conditions\nAcidic in solution\nHeavier than air\nOSHA permissible exposure limit - .5ppm, 15 minute short term exposure limit - 1 ppm.\n\nC. Worst-case Release Scenario\n\nThe worst-case release scenario.  Release from a single one-ton chlorine of cylinder would result in a toxic end-point distance of  2.2 miles.  Our worst-case scenario is failure of one 2,000 pound storage cylinder of chlorine resulting in a vapor cloud. Since this facility is located in a relatively remote, unoccupied area, the worst-case scenario would not affect anyone beyond our property.\n\nD. Release Prevention Program\n\n1. Diaphragm-protected pressure-relief valves in the piping prevent over-pressurization from liquid chlorine entering the system. \n2. The chlorine dispenser is equipped with a vacuum-regulator that prevents flow when the inlet pressure is above 50 psi or when the outlet has no vacuum. \nE. Five-year Accident History\n\nDuring the past five years there has not been an accidental release from the chlorine system that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\nF. Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Response, Action, Contingency, Emergency  (RACE) Plan for Coronado Generating Station is kept in the offices of the plant manager's secretary and the Shift Supervisor.  The plan must be reviewed by all employees involved "

      "SummaryText": "with the storage, handling, and distribution of chlorine.  All other employees working at the site must be made aware of the evacuation routes contained in the plan.\n\nThe Safety/Security Coordinator will establish an incident investigation team to investigate each incident that caused or could have caused a catastrophic release of chlorine within 48.\nThe team will prepare a report that contains the following:\n\n1. Date of incident\n2. Date investigation began\n3. Description of incident\n4. The factors that contributed to the incident and\n5. Any recommendations resulting from the investigation.\n6. Corrective Action Plan\n\nThe report must be maintained in the CGS General Plant Files for at least five years.\n\nG. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Process Hazards and New Equipment Safety and Health team will perform an evaluation of the chlorine system at least every 5 years.  As a minimum, the team will inspect and evaluate the following:\n\n1. Operational and Maintenance procedures\n2. Emergency response procedures and equipment\n3. All regulations pertaining to the chlorine system\n4. All safety and health incidents relative to the system\n5. All drawings, P & ID's, Emergency escape drawings, etc.\n6. Chlorine handling equipment"
