If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the Butler\nVolunteer Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY:\nThis facility is a Propane Refrigerated Natural Gas Liquids Extraction Plant. Natural gas enters the facility into a separator where free water and condensate is removed and sent to a storage tank. The gas enters the inlet compressor where it is pressured up to 750 psi before entering the processing skid. At the processing skid, gas is chilled to -30 degrees Farenheit by means of propane refrigeration thus causing the propane and heavier components of the natural gas to condense. The liquids are sent to a storage tank via pipe where it is metered and shipped off-site via tanktruck.\n\nTHE WORST- CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:\nOur worst-case scenario is failure of our 18,000 gallon storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed (85%at 125F), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenario is a 2 inch rupture in the propane make-up tank, leading to a 10-minute release and explosion. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\nThis facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations. The propane system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA-58 and state law.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\nWe have never had an accident involving propane that caused deaths, injuries, proper"
