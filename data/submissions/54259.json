      "SummaryText": "Sacramento Regional CSD (District), has instituted a Risk Management Program for the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant, as required by Federal Accidental Release Prevention (ARP) Program regulations at 40 CFR Part 68. The Risk Management Program identifies the equipment, procedures, maintenance, inspection, and training associated with Regulated Substances (RS's) handled at the facility in excess of Federal threshold quantities. The program describes the structured assessment of hazards which was conducted to assess possible effects on employees.  The program also describes offsite public and environmental receptors; provides the results of an offsite consequences analysis; defines a prevention program, emergency response program, and mitigation measures to reduce the probability and magnitude of accidental releases of RS's; and establishes a schedule and responsibilities for implementation of mitigation measures and auditing of program elements.  A Risk Management Plan (RMP) 5 year update was filed in March 2009 as required by ARP regulations to revalidate and report the elements of the current Risk Management Program and to describe further measures planned to mitigate or prevent accidental releases of RS's.  This administrative correction is being filed in August of 2010 to note change in Management positions as well as provide for program element review date updates.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nSacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant treats wastewater collected from the City and County of Sacramento, from the Cities of Folsom, West Sacramento (Yolo County), Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova, and Citrus Heights.  It is located at 8521 Laguna Station Rd., Elk Grove, CA on 900 acres of a 3,400-acre site between Interstate 5 and Franklin Blvd., south of Meadowview Rd. The remaining 2,500 acres serve as a buffer between the Plant and nearby residential areas. There are approximately 320 full-time employees at this site and daily c"

Chlorine is used for disinfection, sulfur dioxide for de-chlorination and the Plant maintains quantities of these RS's in amounts greater than the Federal threshold quantities.  Additionally, methane gas, is held in the digester gas system in quantities greater than the Federal threshold quantity. \nThe chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems consist of railcar receiving, liquid chemical withdrawal from railcars, liquid chemical vaporization, and gaseous chemical metering and dissolving into water for ultimate application to various points in the wastewater treatment process.  Solids removed in the wastewater treatment process are introduced into the 11 anaerobic digesters at the Plant. Gas consisting of approximately two-thirds methane is produced in the digesters as bacterial digestion proceeds. The digester gas is scrubbed to remove hydrogen sulfide and other contaminants, stored in low pressure and high pressure gas holders, and piped to a cogeneration plant where it is used to generate electricity and steam.  Digester gas that cannot be used by the cogeneration plant is flared or optionally used as a fuel source for on site boilers. The entire inventory of digester gas in the plant must be considered for the purpose of comparison with the Federal threshold quantity. \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES \nIt is the policy of the District that the receipt, storage and handling of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and the handling of methane, be done in a manner which meets regulatory requirements and minimizes the probability and severity of accidental releases of these RS's to the atmosphere, in order to protect the health and safety of its workers, the public, and the environment.  To accomplish this goal, Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant has gathered safety information on chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane, and on the"

This constitutes the general accidental release prevention program for Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant's operations.  The Maximo Computerized Maintenance Management System is used as a management tool for the Process Safety Management and Risk Management Programs.  \n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RELEASE PREVENTION STEPS \nRelease prevention steps specific to chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and methane processes have been identified and implemented since the original RMP submittal.  These include, among other things, fabrication of custom gauge connection nipples for liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide pressure gauges to limit the rate of liquid release should the gauge fail, removal of the sulfur dioxide bulk storage tank, installation of an additional digester gas flare, implementation of latching gas isolation valves, increased security, and creation of numerous facility-specific operation procedures for the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and digester gas systems. \n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \nThere have be"

Furthmore, the emergency response programs were revised in 2007-8 in close coordination with Cosumnes Fire and Sacramento City Fire Hazmat Departments. Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains First Responder capability with respect to hazardous material releases of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY \nAll of the improvements and mitigation measures identified in the revalidated process hazard analysis which Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant committed to accomplish have been  or are in the process of being completed. Any other measures identified by employees during workplace hazard surveys, or as a result of audit activities by the District or outside Agencies, are thoroughly reviewed and considered for implementation by District staff. Planned safety changes include projects such as improvement to LEL detection alarm programming for accuracy. A study to potentially automate the Plant Emergency Trip (PET) valves in the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems is ongoing.\n\n"
