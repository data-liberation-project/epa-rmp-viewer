This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel, quality assurance, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our process. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside emergency response agencies.\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED [\u00a7 68.155(b)]\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant, located near Mentone, Texas in Loving County, is designed to extract and recover natural gas liquid (NGL) product from raw natural gas by physical separation and cryogenic means. Petroleum condensates are also extracted and transported onward for further processing. The natural gas and NGL products are flammable gases, liquids, or mixtures containing several RMP-regulated substances, listed below, that are at or above the EPA RMP threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.\n\n1. Methane\n2. Ethane\n3. Propane\n4. Butane\n5. Isobutane\n6. Pentane\n7. Isopentane\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM [\u00a7 68.155(c)]\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nThe Loving Gas Plant requires employees to participate in all facets of process management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility\u0092s accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is part of"

These include the development of standardized operating procedures, incident investigation, management of change, safe work practices, and participation in document reviews. In addition, the PSM program requires that process and employee safety issues are addressed as part of normal operations. \n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These technical documents address the following:\n\n1. Chemical properties and associated hazards\n2. Necessary Block Flow Diagrams of the process\n3. Maximum intended inventories\n4. Upper and Lower limits of process fixed and rotating equipment\n5. Equipment design basis and configuration information\n6. Identification of all necessary regulatory equipment design documents\n7. Sufficient information to ensure Good Engineering Practices\n8. Written work procedures with consequences of deviation in them\n\nAll the technical documents referenced above are listed in the Process Safety Information portion of the PSM Manual/Files at the facility.\n\nChemical specific information, including hazard and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDS) which are kept on site at the facility for all employees to read. For specific process areas, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperatures, level and composition in the operator procedures manual. The facility maintains the process within these limits by using process controls, written procedures, monitoring instruments, trained personnel and protective instrument systems such as automated shutdown systems.\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of the process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressures, temperature and electrical ratings. This information, in combination wit"

This program systematically examines potential hazards and puts controls in place to manage hazards. The PHAs conducted included HAZOPS and What If Checklists methodologies and included a team of employees who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team is tasked to identify, evaluate and make recommendations in the management of the potential hazards associated with the process. If possible, the team affects the changes necessary to mitigate the hazards identified. If the mitigation required is more involved or cannot be mitigated by the team, their findings are forwarded to management for resolution. The approved mitigation options in response to the PHA team's findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nThe facility periodically updates and revalidates the PHA to ensure that the hazards identified have been properly mitigated and that new hazards or previously unknown hazards can be dealt with. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five (5) years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer in operation. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant maintains written Operating Procedures of the covered process that address primary operations mandated by OSHA, EPA, Good Engineering Practices, and manufacturers. These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. Procedures are perio"

Covered process Operating Procedures are readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job task and maintain the covered process unit operating within its safe limits.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant has developed and implemented safe work practices as mandated by OSHA, EPA, Industrial Standards, and Good Engineering Practices to provide the control of hazards and to ensure the safety of employees and the public.\n\nTraining\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the covered process. New employees receive basic training in process operations at this facility. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. A performance review and written test specific to the facility operations is administered and must be successfully completed during this training period. After the operator demonstrates adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they are allowed to work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the Operating Procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three (3) years, or more frequently upon request or need. All training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify and demonstrate skills.\n\nContractors\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant uses Contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction act"

Inspections and tests are performed to help verify that equipment functions as intended and that equipment is operating within acceptable limits. If a deficiency is identified and the situation presents an immediate safety concern, the deficiency is corrected before placing the equipment back into service. A Management of Change team will review the use of equipment and determine what action is necessary.\n\nAn integral part of the Mechanical Integrity Program is quality assurance. Loving Gas Plant incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs. This helps to ensure new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nManagement Of Change (MOC)\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant has a comprehensive system to manage changes to all reported covered processes. This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology and procedures be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.\nChanges are reviewed to:\n\n1. Ensure changes do not introduce unknown hazards to the process \n2. Determine that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards\n3. Verify that existing controls ha"

All operations and maintenance personnel are appropriately trained on changes prior to being implemented or before affected personnel are expected to perform duties on equipment or processes relevant to the change.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Loving Gas Plant promptly investigates all incidents related to a covered process that result in or could reasonably result in a fire/explosion, property damage, environmental loss or personnel injury. The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause(s) and develop corrective action to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident. The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent future occurrences, and forwards these results to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented and investigation reports are retained for at least five (5) years.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, the Loving Gas Plant conducts compliance audits at least every three (3) years to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented. Facility and support personnel, including operations, maintenance, engineering and HSE, participate in the audits. The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to facility management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS [\u00a7 68.155(c)]\n\nThe follo"
