THE FACILITY POLICY\n\n   The owners, management, and employees of Five Star Co-op Fertilizer Co. are committed to the \nprevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur\nthe facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any\nrelease and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION  \n\n   -The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n\n   -Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both application.\n\n   -The maximum quantity stored would be 160,000 pounds in our 2-18,000 gallon storage tanks.\n\n3.  The worst case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\n   a.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 16,000 pounds which\nrepresents the volume of the storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The \ndistance to the endpoint {point of dispersion to 200ppm} is 1.16 miles.\n\n   b.  The alternate release scenario based on the best information possible is a release from a \nbreak in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200ppm) is\n.56 miles.\n\n4.  The accidental release prevention program.\n\n   The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety requirements for the Storage and Handling\nof Anhydrous ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the\nstandards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111,\n\"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous ammonia\".\n\n5.  The Five Year Accident History\n\n   a.  There have been no accidental releases"

The emergency response program.\n\n   -The facility has:\n\n   -Call emergency response personnel from outside the firm.  \n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n   Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed \nto assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia\nsafety recommendations for implementation at this time.\n\n\n   Thomas Brolsma - General Manager"
