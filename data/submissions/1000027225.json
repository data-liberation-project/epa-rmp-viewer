Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\r\n\r\nGrocers Supply Company recognizes management's responsibility in protecting its employees, the public, the environment, equipment, and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Houston facility.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish the company's goal in preventing accidents, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance, eliminate human suffering resulting from injuries and accidents and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Progra"

      "SummaryText": "ms for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs help prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses, environmental impacts and physical property damage.\r\n\r\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\r\n\r\nThe Grocers Supply Company facility in Houston, Texas is a refrigerated warehouse for grocery storage.  It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 29,435 pounds, revised to reflect the current inventory due to the new condenser addition in 2012).  Since ammonia releases from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program regulation.\r\n\r\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Grocers Supply Company facility involves the release of ammonia due to the unlikely failure of the ammonia High Pressure Receiver.  A release of 10,400 lbs is used as the release amount.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.2 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard"
