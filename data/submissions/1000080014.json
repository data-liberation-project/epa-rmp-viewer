Senior management commitment to safety has been established as a top-down function that includes employee involvement and associated agencies and appropriate vendors and contractors.  The Town of Jupiter policies include local response to small spills, 911 responses to releases and an on-going maintenance and training efforts that include appropriate documentation.\r\n\r\n2.0  Your facility and the regulated substances handled\r\n\r\nThe Town of Jupiter WTP provides potable drinking water to the residents of the Town of Jupiter, Town of Juno Beach, and in unincorporated areas of Palm Beach County and Martin County.  The Town uses chlorine gas injection for disinfection to make the drinking water potable.  This process has been in use for over three decades.  The process is stable.  The WTP produces an average of 16.25 million gallons per day (MGD) of water daily for a service area of 88,000 residents @ 2.29 people per residential connection.  There are 30,100 connections.  The WTP uses and estimated 1,675 lbs. of chlorine daily depending on the season of the year of chlorine with a total storage capacity of 48,000 lbs. or 24 containers.\r\n\r\n3.0  The worst case release scenario(s) and the alternative release scenario(s)\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the two release scenarios of chlorine:\r\n\r\nThe worst case release is a one-ton container (2,000 pounds) of gaseous chlorine spewing at a release rate of 110 pounds per minute in a total of 600 seconds.  This release scenario has a potential of a 0.9-mile radius plume dispersion.  The worst case scenario could negatively impact 8,955 persons, 577 public receptors and 2 environmental re"

The alternate release could have a 0.1-mile radius plume dispersal and could negatively impact 80 persons and 25 public receptors (based on Jupiter GIS, 2010 Census).\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0   The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\r\n\r\nThe details of the Town of Jupiter WTP Prevention Programs are contained in Part VI: Accident Prevention Programs of the written RMP document.  In the document, there are policies and procedures to ensure the continued safe operation of the chlorination process.  They include SOPs, employee awareness and involvement, maintaining the mechanical integrity of the process, procedures for management of change, revising and updating the process hazard analysis (PHA), performing pre-startup reviews and employee training.\r\n\r\n5.0  The five year accident history\r\n\r\nThe Jupiter WTP personnel have conducted a thorough record search and have not discovered any reportable releases in the history of the WTP.  This covers a period much longer than the five-year period.\r\n\r\nOccasional small chlorine leaks, associated with packing glands and valve stem packing have periodically occurred.  When these events occur, the contamination is rapidly removed by the chlorine scrubber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.0  The Emergency Response Program\r\n\r\nThe Town of Jupiter WTP is a non-responding stationary source whose employees will not respond to a major accidental chlorine gas release.  If a leak is discovered and the chlorine gas contaminant concentration is minor (below 0.9 ppm), the operator will try to stop the leak by turning 1/4 turn to close the ball valve.  If the leak cannot be stopped, then 911 is summoned to respond to the release.  Palm Beach County Regional Hazardous Materials Response Team (PBCRHMRT) will respond to the 911 call and mitigate the chlorin"

When certain criteria to indicate a chlorine gas breach is met, the SITE EVACUATION ALARM will activate and a yelping siren will sound to signal evacuation.  Employees at the facility are trained on how to safely evacuate to avoid the contaminant plume which will travel in the direction of the prevailing wind.\r\n\r\nThe Fire Department and Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) handle public notification of releases on a larger, more encompassing regional community emergency response plan.  The facility is included in this community emergency response plan.  \r\n\r\n \r\n7.0  Planned changes to improve safety\r\n\r\nChanges to improve safety are typically derived from deficient findings found during the 3-year regulatory required compliance audits, during process hazard analysis (PHA) revisions or re-validations, during routine mechanical maintenance and technological changes.\r\n\r\nAn action item list is generated whenever a compliance audit or a PHA revision or re-validation is performed. The list states the safety action; the responsible party for completing the action; the priority deadline; the reference to the appropriate section in the compliance audit or PHA that dealt with the action; and the current status of the action item.  The PHA Action Item List is provided in Appendix E of the written Risk Management Plan (RMP).  The EPA RMP compliance audits and the corresponding action item list can be found in Appendix C of the RMP.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes to be implemented in 2019 include:\r\n   + Replacement of the chlorine scrubber system (completed)\r\n   + Replacement of the HMI panel attached to the chlorine building (completed)"
