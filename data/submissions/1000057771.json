With a focus on quality every step of the way, from farm to fork, more than 2.5 billion pounds of poultry is processed annually in our 11 facilities.  Many of these products are marketed worldwide under the brands of WAYNE FARMS(R), DUTCH QUALITY HOUSE (R) and PLATINUM HARVEST (R).  We employ approximately 9800 people who are dedicated to offering the highest quality, best value products possible.\r\n\r\nThe Wayne Farms Dothan facility is located at 808 Ross Clark Circle in Houston County, Alabama, in the town of Dothan.  The facility is a poultry processing plant which employs approximately 840 associates.  The facility normally operates 24 hours per day, 5 days per week. The refrigeration department, however, works 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\r\n\r\nThe regulated substance at the Dothan facility, covered by 40 CFR Part 68, is anhydrous ammonia (R-717).  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as integral part of its refrigeration system, which consists of several storage vessels, compressors, condensers, piping and air handling units throughout the processing plant in order to maintain proper food safety temperatures.  The total system capacity of anhydrous ammonia on-site is 55,417 pounds distributed throughout the refrigeration components.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nAs a concerned member of the community, the company takes its role as a responsible corporate citizen very seriously.
