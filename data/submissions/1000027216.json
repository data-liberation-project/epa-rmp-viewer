We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to ensure continued operations with protection in environmental, health and safety (EHS) protection in mind.  This document provides a  brief overview of our comprehensive risk management activities to prevent or eliminate the possibility of an accidental release of a regulated chemical.\n\n\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent the release of a regulated substance, however, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of any release.   We are also coordinated with the Houston area?s Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.0    Stationary Source  and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nOur facility cracks Naptha, OP-400, and Algerian condensates into a number of products that include 1,3-Butadiene, Isobutylene/Butene, Isoprene, Propylene, Isobutane and other olefins.  In addition, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) and an assortment of products are produced in the East Plant / Mid Plant unit, including Isopropanol.  There are two Olefins Cracking units and one East Plant/Mid Plant manufacturing unit.  These operating units utilize the following chemicals that have been identifed by the EPA as having the potential to cause significant off-site consequences in the event of their substantial accidental release:\n\n\n\n\n\nToxics - NONE\n\n\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\n\n\nPropylene: Approximately 1,500,000 lbs. are stored and used on-site.

The condensates include Algerian, OP-400, and Naptha condensate materials, depending in most part to the supplier.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIsobutylene: Approximately 1.1 million lbs. are contained in storage and within the East Plant process unit.  Isobutylene is an intermediate chemical used in the production of MTBE.\n\n\n\n1,3-Butadiene: Approximately 3.5 million pounds of Butadiene are stored and in process within the East Plant.  Butadiene is further utilized on the Poly-Butadiene process within the Mid Plant as well as sold as a finished product.\n\n\n\nN-Butane: Approximately 1.3 million lbs. are contained in storage and within the East Plant process unit.  N-Butane is an intermediate chemical and is sent to the Olefins Cracking Units for further processing.\n\n\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulated Flammable Chemicals\n\n\n\nWorst-Case Scenario ? Olefins Condensate Storage Tank (Flammable Mixture)\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario for flammables assumes the complete rupture of the isobutylene surge drum, releasing 26,620,000 lbs. of this flammable mixture into a diked area, leading to a vapor cloud explosion and overpressure.  The overpressure would extend beyond the fenceline 2.4mi. And affect approximately 11,000 people.\n\n\n\nAlternate Release Scenario ? Propylene\n\n\n\nThe alternate release scenario for flammables assumes a mechanical failure of a valve on the 4th stage suction drum on the Olefins 2 Propylene refrigeration system, resulting in a release of the entire compressor circuit.  The scenario also assumes that the release would not be controlled for 15 minutes and that all active safety systems fail.  The "

Addiitonally, this facility was designed and constructed in accordance with strict internal engineering standards as well as is subject to the requirements under 29 CFR 1910.119 ? Process Safety Management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information: Chemical hazard, process technology, and equipment information is documented, kept up-to-date, and made available to operating personnel.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazards Analyses (PHAs): A rigorous practice of reviewing new processes or changes to existing processes at the design stage, with the overall thougth of identifying and mitigating HSE issues before installation or operation.  Scheduled PHAs are conducted every 5 years to revalidate previous hazard reviews and recommend corrective actions to prevent accidents.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures: Operating procedures provide detail on how to safely operate a process and are kept up-to-date constantly thru a review during any SOP training opportunity.  Operating procedures are based on process hazard / risk reviews and are periodically modified after completed of a process PHA.  Operating procedures include safe start-up and emergency shutdown of a process unit.\n\n\n\nOperator Training / Certification Program: CVON has a training and testing program that ensures that operators have the proper skills and knowledge prior to allowing them to independently operate a process.  Periodic operator re-certification is required.\n\n\n\nComputerized Process Simulation: Computerized simulation programs a"
