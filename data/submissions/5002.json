Inc. recognizes management's responsibility in protecting, its employees, the public, the environment, equiptment and property.  The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of accidents has been and will continue to be a basic responsibility of all personnel in the Hutchinson, KS facility.\n\nTo accomplish the company's goal in controlling accidental losses, the facility has established a Plant Safety Program.  The objectives of the Plant Safety Program are to: maximize safety performance,, eliminate human suffering and the economic burden resulting from injuries and accidents, and reduce losses associated with damage of property.\n\nOne of the activities associated with the Plant Safety Program has been the development and implementation of accidental release prevention and emergency response programs which are designed to comply with OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard (Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals, 29 CFR 1910.119), and EPA's Risk Management Program (RM program) regulation (Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention, 40 CFR Part 68).  Mr. Galen Childs, Corporate Project Engineer and Mr. Jim Barkley, Safety Manager, are responsible for implementation of the Risk Management Program.\n\nThe purpose of the accidental release prevention and emergency response programs is to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response programs help prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment"

They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nIn addition to the Plant Safety Program, the Jackson Ice Cream Co. Inc. facility follows the following corporate and site-specific safety guidelines:\n\n     Jackson employee plant safety rules\n     Jackson contractor safety program\n     Jackson Behavioral Safety Process\n     Lock out Tag out program\n     Safety Community Tool Box Training\n\nB.   Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\nJackson Ice Cream Co. Inc. is part of the Kroger Company.  The facility manufactures frozen dough products and bakery items.   It operates an ammonia refrigeration system to provide cooling and freezing capabilities.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia (CAS #7662-41-7) contained in the system is in excess of 10,000 pounds.  The maximum inventory in the system is approximately 27,027 pounds.  Since an ammonia release from the system could pose a risk of offsite public and/or environmental impact and the system is regulated under the OSHA PSM standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the system is subject to the Program 3 requirements of the EPA's RM program.\n\n\nC.   Summary of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario at the Jackson Ice Cream Co. Inc. facility involves the release of 7,000 pounds of ammonia over a 10 minute period due to the failure of the main ammonia storage receiver.  This quantity represents the full capacity of the vessel, which is a conservative assumption as it is not full (85% is maximum) under normal operating conditions.  Under worst-case weather conditions, ammonia could travel 1.0 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public. This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         The worst-case weather conditions which were u"

Inc. facility involves the release of 3780 pounds of ammonia over a 15 minute period due to the pressure relief valve on the main ammonia storage receiver failing open.  Under alternative release weather conditions, ammonia could travel 0.1 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public.  This distance has been calculated based on the method provided in EPA's Risk Management Program (40 CFR 68) Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\n\nThe alternative release scenario is unlikely for the following reasons:\n\n         Industry standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of the pressure relief valves;\n         Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n         The pressure relief valves are elevated to minimize potential damage from traffic, fork lifts etc.;\n         The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on-going integrity of the system; \n         The facility has a training program designed to ensure that the system is operated by qualified personnel; and,\n         The facility emergency response procedures enable trained personnel to respond quickly to isolate any potential releases by closing isolation valves .\n\nD.

Employees are also to be involved when a process hazard analysis is conducted.  The program also ensures that all employees have complete access to the program.\n\n         Process Safety Information: Written information has been collected which enables the employees to identify and understand the potential hazards in the system. The written information includes the ammonia MSDS and a description of the design of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n         Process Hazard Analysis (PHA): Formal studies using the What-If/Checklist Technique have been conducted to examine the system and identify potential hazards.  Any recommendations from the PHA are resolved to improve facility safety.\n\n         Operating Procedures:  Written, detailed procedures have been developed which describe the steps which should be followed to safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n         Training: A training program has been developed which ensures that employees are trained on all aspects of the system and on the duties which they should perform to ensure the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system.\n\n         Contractors: All contractors are screened and evaluated before they perform work on or near the ammonia refrigeration system.  The contractors are also periodically evaluated to ensure that they perform work by following safe work practices.\n\n         Pre-Startup Safety Review: A pre-startup safety review is required for all new ammonia projects to verify that all safety programs are in place, training has been performed, and construction has been completed according to design standards before the project is put into use. A pre-startup safety review is also performed when the process safety information related to the system changes significantly.\n\n         Mechanical Integrity:  This progr"
