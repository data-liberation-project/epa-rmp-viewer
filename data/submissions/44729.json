In order to protect employees and contractors from suffering and hardship caused by injuries, it is the policy of INEOS Phenol to promote safe working practices and maintain a safe working environment through effective accident prevention programs.

Under worse-case scenario conditions, a catastrophic event would have to occur releasing the entire content, the flammable material propane, from a pressurized system resulting in a subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  The radius of the potentially impacted surrounding area from this scenario would not affect any off-site receptors or residential areas.  This scenario is highly improbable and did not consider any mitigation system present during the release.\n\nA more probable release event would occur if a process line containing a flammable mixture developed a leak, which resulted in a subsequent vapor cloud fire event.  This scenario was the alternative scenario considered in the development of the Risk Management Plan.  This release event would not have a potential impact to any off-site receptors or residential areas.  This scenario did not consider any mitigation system present during the release.\n\nThe INEOS Phenol Port Arthur facility has not had an accidental release of regulated chemicals in the last five (5) years.\n\nIn the event a significant release occurs, the site Emergency Response Team, comprised of employees of  INEOS Phenol and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, would be notified immediately to respond.  In the event outside services are required, coordination with the Port Arthur fire department and Jefferson County Local Emergency Planning Committee will be made.\n\nINEOS Phenol is committed to continuous improvement of its safety program.  By conducting regular safety training classes, performing routing process hazard analysis (PHA), and implementing advanced safety programs, INEOS Phenol is focused on continual improvement of the overall safety culture for its employees and contractors."

The manufacturing activity involves a polypropylene/propane feed stream, two subject flammable materials in excess of reportable quantities,  to covert benzene to cumene.  During the manufacturing process, all of the propylene from the mixture is consumed during the conversion step.  The propane is then provided to an adjacent industry for use in their manufacturing operations. \n\nThe INEOS Phenol Port Arthur facility employs approximately twenty-one full-time employees, with a minimum of four employees present at all times .  Daily inspections of the areas containing subject chemicals are conducted by the facility employees.  In addition, the production area is equipped with a perimeter monitoring/detection system, which alarms if a flammable concentration of subject chemicals is detected. \n\nINEOS Phenol uses a layered approach to minimize the likelihood of an accidental release occurring at its Port Arthur facility.  The approach utilizes a combination of technology, skilled personnel, and compliance with federal, state, and local regulations, codes, and standards in the release prevention program.
