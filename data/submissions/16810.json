In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out.  Zero Mountain, Inc. has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n5.\tFive-year Accident History\nZero Mountain, Inc. has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, only one accidental release has occurred during this period.\n\nThere has been only one accidental release of our regulated substance from our facility within the last 5 years.  This release took place on 04/20/1997 and involved 5000 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous).  No deaths or injuries occured offsite as a result of this accident.  A few evacuations were issued.  Onsite, there were no deaths or injuries.  There was some onsite property damage.  \n\n6.\tEmergency Response Plan\nZero Mountain, Inc. carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced.

The scenario involves the release of 5438.40 lb. of ammoina vapor.  Toxic gas is assumed to be released to the atmosphere.  The entire release is estimated to have occurred for 6.56 minutes.  The release is also assumed to be controlled by the emergency dump station, emergency shutdown systems, ammonia sensors and emergency responce from the Haz-Mat Team.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 200 parts per million (ppm)(0.14 mg/L) of Ammonia (anhydrous) is 0.61 miles.\n\nAnother alternative release scenario for Ammonia (anhydrous) involves a release from Condenser #1 of the Ammonia Refrigeration System in Cave #2.

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is the What if.. methodology.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of at least every five years or as needed.  Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 05/19/1999.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered process, Zero Mountain, Inc. maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\nZero Mountain, Inc. has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating the process are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.

This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\n\n\n2.\tThe Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass providing refrigerated storage and blast freezing for fresh and frozen foods..  We have 1 regulated substance present at our facility.  This substance is Anhydrous Ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant in our system.                                        .\nThe maximum inventory of Ammonia (anhydrous) at our facility is approximately 38,000 lb. for Cave #1 and approximatley 45,000 lb for Cave #2.\n\n3.\tThe Worst Case Release Scenario(s) and the Alternative Release Scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we have used the EPA's RMP Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration  Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for our Program 3 toxic substance involves a catastrophic release from the High Pressure Receiver of the Ammonia Refrigeration System in Cave #2.  In this scenario 5438.40 lb. of Ammonia (anhydrous) is released.  The toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1 cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the"
