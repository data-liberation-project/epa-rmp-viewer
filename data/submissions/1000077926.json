      "SummaryText": "The Canton Water Department is committed to providing its communities with clean, safe drinking water.  As is common practice with most municipal water providers, in the process of treating the water, the Canton Water Department uses chlorine as a disinfectant for the water.  Chlorine gas, as is used by the Water Department, is a toxic chemical in its pure state.  This characteristic is what makes chlorine an effective disinfectant when added to water in small concentrations.  However, special care must be used in handling and processing the chlorine used to treat the water to protect the health of both employees of the Water Department and the general public.  The Canton Water Department has developed a Risk Management Program to minimize the possibility of releases of chlorine, and to ensure an immediate, effective response in the case that a release does occur.  The Canton Water Department is committed to this program to protect its employees as well as the general public.\n\nOne of the initial steps of the Risk Management Program was to determine the possible chlorine release scenarios.  The worst case release scenario and a more realistic release scenario were determined using computer models developed by the U.S. EPA.  These scenarios were then used to further evaluate the Department's Release Prevention Program and Emergency Response plan.\n\nThe Canton Water Department has a Release Prevention Program that is used to minimize the chance of any release occurring.  The Program details standard operating procedures, employee training, and maintenance procedures that have been developed and successfully used by the water treatment industry.  To be prepared in the case of an accidental release, the Canton Water Department has developed an Emergency Response Plan.  The plan details how a release would be handled, medical treatments, and employee training.  The Canton Water Department also coordinates its Emergency Response procedures with the local fire departments.\n\n"

It will continue to review and update the program, as new technologies become available and to address changes in the water treatment process."
