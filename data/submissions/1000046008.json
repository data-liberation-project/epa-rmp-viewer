      "SummaryText": "RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (CalARP)\r\nAND PROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\r\n\r\nChlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, and Aqueous Ammonia Systems\r\nCity of Stockton Tertiary Treatment Facility\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\nRevised June 30, 2014\r\n\r\nThe City of Stockton Municipal Utilities Department (MUD) prepared a Chemical Risk Management Program and Process Safety Management Program (RMP/PSM) for the Regional Wastewater Control Facility Tertiary Treatment Facility (TTF) in general accordance with state and federal regulations. The state risk management regulations, also referred to as the California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), are codified in California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Section 2735, et. seq. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also regulates facilities with certain toxic and flammable substances. The federal regulations are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 40, Section 68. Finally, both the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CalOSHA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulate facilities with certain acutely hazardous materials under the PSM standards as defined in CCR, Title 8, Section 5189 and CFR Title 29, Part 1910, Section 119, respectively. All applicable regulations will henceforth be referred to as RMP/PSM/CalARP in this report.\r\n\r\nTTF prepared the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program to satisfy regulatory requirements and to demonstrate a commitment to evaluate and improve chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia handling systems and practices at the TTF. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nTTF has developed a management system for the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program, has performed a Process Hazard Analysis, developed prevention program elements, and formulated an emergency response plan in case of an accidental release of a regulated substance. The Emergency Response Program is outlined below and is contained in a separate document. The Preve"

TTF will continue to improve chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia handling safety through the implementation of the prevention program elements of the RMP/PSM/CalARP Program.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\r\nTTF performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) revalidation in 2014 and developed a new list of suggested mitigation measures. TTF management has responded to all suggested mitigation measures  \r\npromptly and has established completion schedules for proposed actions. Management responses and support will be consistent with TTF's commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations. Changes suggested during the PHA included:\r\n\u00bf\tEvaluating the installation of a facility-wide system for emergency notification.\r\n\u00bf\tMaking improvements in the Preventative Maintenance (PM) Program regarding testing and verification of certain sensors and switches.\r\n\u00bf\tIdentifying and numbering valves on P&ID and equipment.\r\n\r\nCity of Stockton MUD recognizes that the RMP/PSM/CalARP is a continuous process for evaluating, monitoring, and improving chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia handling operations at its TTF. As such, this document and related attachments and program elements will evolve as TTF continues their ongoing focus and dedication of risk minimization and safety improvement for their employees and surrounding community. TTF will submit revised information if a change occurs that is considered significant and requires resubmission under the regulations. However, minor improvements/modifications to the RMP/PSM/CalARP, related attachments,"

State Highway 4 (mailing address 2500 Navy Drive), Stockton, California. The area is zoned for industrial use. This TTF processes wastewater for Stockton, processing approximately 34 million gallons of wastewater per day. \r\n\r\nChlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia are used in the TTF's wastewater treatment system. The chlorine system, which is an open system, contains a maximum of approximately 360,000 pounds of chlorine in two 90-ton railroad cars (railcars). The system takes liquid chlorine from a railcar, changes the liquid to a gas in evaporators, and then provides gaseous chlorine to water ejectors which mix the gas with water to form a disinfecting agent at various points in the TTF. As a final disinfection step for treated wastewater, chlorine and aqueous ammonia, if needed to allow formation of monochloramines, are mixed with the wastewater in the chlorine contact basin (CCB). The monochloramines are a more powerful disinfectant than chlorine itself. At the end of the CCB, a sulfur dioxide injection is used to remove residual chlorine before the treated effluent is released to the San Joaquin River.\r\n\r\nThe sulfur dioxide system, which is an open system, contains approximately 66,086 pounds of sulfur dioxide in one 3,600-gallon aboveground storage tank (AST). The system takes liquid sulfur dioxide from the AST, changes the liquid to a gas in evaporators, mixes the gaseous sulfur dioxide with water in sulfonators, and then provides the sulfur dioxide solution to water ejectors. The water ejectors mix the solution with wat"

Administrative controls include, but are not limited to, formal training programs for system operators, emergency training, a hot work permit program, a lockout/tagout program, a contractor safety program, incident investigation program, mechanical integrity program, management of change program, pre startup safety review program and an auditing and inspection program. Written standard operating procedures (SOPs) are in place for all the regulated systems at the TTF. The SOPs provide a basis for site specific operator training and a ready reference for operating and trouble-shooting the systems.\r\n\r\nTTF is committed to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia systems. A preventive maintenance system is utilized to manage the maintenance of the system. Preventive maintenance at the TTF includes shift, daily, weekly, and periodic inspection; calibration; testing; and overhaul of chlorine and sulfur dioxide equipment. The maintenance system is used to track equipment performance and to create reports that are used by maintenance personnel to monitor the frequency of repairs and deviations from normal operating parameters.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\nThe RMP/PSM/CalARP regulations require a review of the 5-year accident history at the regulated facility.

The aqueous ammonia system contains approximately 4,532 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in the solution. The system takes aqueous ammonia from the AST and mixes it with wastewater in the contact channel to maintain a chlorine/nitrogen balance in the wastewater transiting the contact channel before discharge to the San Joaquin River. Aqueous ammonia in the concentration used at TTF is not regulated by the federal government (either EPA or OSHA) but is regulated under the CalARP program. The aqueous ammonia system is used to maintain a proper amount of ammonia in the treated effluent at the head of the CCB before chlorine is added. The incoming effluent will contain a small amount of ammonia as a carryover from the treatment processes it has undergone. However, a closely controlled amount of ammonia is necessary to assist in the formation of monochloramines at the head of the CCB. The ammonia concentration of the incoming effluent is measured and more ammonia is added if necessary to maintain the needed concentration.\r\n\r\nThe RMP/PSM/CalARP regulations require facilities to identify and evaluate chemical release scenarios resulting from potential failures of the chemical handling systems covered by the RMP/PSM/CalARP. Program 2 and 3 requirements of the RMP/PSM/CalARP apply to the TTF due to the quantity of chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia used. Program 2 and 3 facilities are required to evaluate a worst case release scenario (release parameters are defined by the regulations) and an alternative release scenario for each identified regulated chemical over the threshold quantity. The regulations define a worst-case release scenario as ... the greatest amount"

An alternative release scenario is identified as a release that is more likely to occur at the TTF.\r\n\r\nThis TTF has prepared worst-case and alternative release scenarios. These are not summarized herein as recommended by EPA, but are presented in the RMP/PSM/CalARP.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe RMP/PSM/CalARP regulations require a review of the accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps used by the TTF. TTF has incorporated many safety features in the chlorine, sulfur dioxide, and aqueous ammonia systems to prevent system failures and to mitigate potential releases. The predominant safety concern with the systems is an inadvertent buildup of pressure exceeding pressure ratings or capacities of equipment due to chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide (trapped liquid) expansion. The TTF chlorine system is continuously monitored by automated control systems that shut down railcar valves if deviations from normal operating conditions occur. Liquid chlorine piping is protected by expansion tanks wherever the possibility of trapping liquid chlorine exists. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all liquid piping and most, if not all, additional locations within the chlorine system where chlorine could become trapped. Pressure relief valves vent to atmosphere away from most operator activity. The sulfur dioxide system has leak detection sensors at the tank which will close the liquid supply valves on detecting a leak. The tank shutoff valves can also be operated remotely by a system operator. The sulfur dioxide piping is protected by expansion tanks wherever the possibility of trapping liquid sulfur dioxide exists. Further, the system is equipped with pressure relief valves on all liquid piping and most, if not all, additional locations within the sulfur dioxide system where sulfur dioxide could become trappe"
