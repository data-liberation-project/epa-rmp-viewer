The regulated substances handled at the source in excess of their applicable threshold qualities are chlorine dioxide (CAS No. 10049-04-4) and chlorine (CAS No. 7782-50-5).  There are two covered processes with chlorine and one covered process with chlorine dioxide.\n\n\n\nIn each process, an accidental release of a potentially hazard"
