Pasadena Plant is located on 2.5 acres within the LyondellBasell Bayport Chemical complex on the SE-side of the city of Pasadena, Harris County, Texas. The property is bounded on the north by vacant rural land, on the west by Underwood Road, on the south and the east by the LyondellBasell Bayport Chemical complex.\n\n  \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICY:\n\n\n\nSolvay's Pasadena plant is committed to conducting its business in a responsible manner, in the best interest of our stakeholders, including our employees, neighbors, visitors, contractors, customers, the public and the environment. This policy is consistent with our Corporate Policy. Through this policy, the employees of the Pasadena facility uphold the commitment to comply with all applicable HSSE rules and regulations, corporate policy & requirements as well as the commitment to the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care Program and continuous improvements in the site HSSE management system. The Solvay Pasadena facility is also committed to comply with the American Chemistry Council's Process Safety Code, which is one of 3 sets of Codes under the umbrella of the ACC's Integrated Responsible Care Management System. Solvay believes in ownership of work processes by every employee. Accordingly, we believe it is the responsibility of every Pasadena employee to work safely and to maintain high standards in Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental Affairs in all aspects of our operations. \n\n\n\nThe Solvay Pasadena site is required to comply with Solvay's Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  Solvay's PSM program meets the requirements of OSHA's Process Safety Management program as detailed in 29 CFR 1910.119 & EPA's Risk Management Program as detailed in 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nSolvay's PSM program comprises the following 14 elements:\n\n\n\n 1.

Propylene Oxide is the only RMP-listed chemical stored on the plant site. It is stored in a 30,000-gallon storage tank that is mounded with concrete for enhanced safety. Propylene Oxide is delivered to the site by tank-truck.\n\n\n\nIn addition to propylene oxide, the Pasadena Plant uses other non-regulated chemicals in its processes to manufacture a variety of surfactants & intermediates that are supplied to a number of different manufacturing industries which include, but are not limited to, the following;  agricultural chemicals, coatings, oil field chemicals, and personal care products.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND PROPYLENE OXIDE SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS:\n\n\n\nManagement at the Pasadena Plant is committed to utilizing the 14 elements of Solvay's PSM program to mitigate the potential for process incidents.  In addition, all plant employees receive training on all 14 elements, and their participation is required in every aspect of the Process Safety Management program on site. All Plant personnel have also been trained on Solvay's Life-Saving Rules and Life-Critical Safety Procedures.\n\n\n\nAfter start-up, the Pasadena Plant will conduct periodic self-assessments (audits) to evaluate compliance with the OSHA-PSM & EPA-RMP program requirements, and develop action plans to ensure timely correct"

Hazardous Material Training\n\n> Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response Training\n\n\n\nThe Pasadena site also has an extensive Preventive Maintenance program which includes systematic testing and maintenance of process safety controls and devices.  The propylene oxide handling and storage operations are equipped with the following process safety controls and devices:\n\n\n\n> Pressure Relief Valves\n\n> Excess Flow Prevention Valves\n\n> High Temperature / High Pressure Indicators, Alarms and Interlocks\n\n> High Temperature / High Pressure Shutdown and Deluge System\n\n> Nitrogen Purging System\n\n> Propylene Oxide Leak Detection/Alarm System\n\n> Computerized Process Controls (DCS), with Safety Trips via Safety Instrumented System\n\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\n\n\nSince the site has not yet commenced production, there is no existing five-year accident history. Given the site's operational status, it has not experienced any process incidents nor any RMP-reportable incidents related to Propylene Oxide Storage and Handling operations. In other words, the plant has zero reportable accidents/incidents to date, in line with Solvay's goal of zero occupational accidents for all employees and contractors working at the Pasadena site.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\n\n\n\nSolvay USA Inc., Pasadena Facility maintains a written Emergency Response Plan that addresses accidental releases of hazardous chemicals on site.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including incident command system of response management, adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas and c"
