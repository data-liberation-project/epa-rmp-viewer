      "SummaryText": "The Coatings and Adhesives facility is committed to operating in a manner that provides safety of its employees and neighbors and for the protection of the environment.  A key element of this commitment is the safe and proper handling of chemicals.  Controls have been implemented to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances.  In the event of an accidental release, mitigation steps are taken to stop, control, contain and clean up the releases.\r\n\r\nThe Coatings and Adhesives facility is a modern, technologically advanced chemical manufacturing facility.  The physical address for the facility is 1901 Popular Street NE, Leland, NC 28451.  The plant is located in Brunswick County, North Carolina.    \r\n\r\nAqueous ammonia is utilized at the site to manufacture certain coatings and adhesives.  This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The maximum inventory at the facility will exceed 20,000 pounds of 20% concentration or greater of aqueous ammonia after the new 20,000 gallon storage tank is constructed. \r\n\r\nThe facility currently uses aqueous ammonia from totes. Until the storage tank is constructed additional totes may be utilized at the facility to meet production requirements.  This RMP has been prepared and submitted at this time in case the maximum inventory of aqueous ammonia of 20% concentration or greater exceeds 20,000 pounds prior to construction of the storage tank. \r\n\r\nVinyl Acetate Monomer is utilized at the site to manufacture certain coatings and adhesives.  This substance is regulated under 40 CFR Part 68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions. The maximum inventory at the facility will exceed 15,000 pounds of vinyl acetate monomer after the new 30,000 gallon storage tank is constructed.\r\n\r\nThe new aqueous ammonia and vinyl acetate monomer storage tanks will be constructed as business requirements and capital expenditures allow. This RMP has been prepared assuming both tanks will be constructed withi"

      "SummaryText": "n the five-year period of this initial RMP for the facility.\r\n\r\nThe Facility's key goals are to operate in 100% compliance with existing environmental regulations which include accurate and timely reporting, and striving for steady reduction of environmental impact.  The Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for its employees, the public and the environment.  \r\n\r\nAs part of this commitment, the Facility has established a system that includes a classroom and on-the-job training, written operating procedures, hazard analysis, incident investigations, and maintenance guidelines to help ensure the safe use of aqueous ammonia and vinyl acetate monomer.  The facility maintains the components of this system by conducting visual inspections on a routine basis and performing nondestructive testing of tanks and piping to ensure that any potential failures are detected before they occur.  Highly skilled operators and mechanics, level controls, safety interlocks, emergency shutdown procedures, and preventative maintenance requirements make a worst case release highly unlikely. \r\n\r\nThe Facility has had no accidents (incidents) involving aqueous ammonia or vinyl acetate monomer in the last five years that resulted in injuries or property damage.  If there is an incident with aqueous ammonia or vinyl acetate monomer, a highly trained and skilled emergency response team is on standby 24 hours a day.  Leland Fire Rescue provides backup resources if needed.  Southeast Remediation and Recovery is under contract with Coatings and Adhesives to assist with any spills."
