It is the Blacksburg-VPI Sanitation AuthorityA?s intent to enforce the policies and procedures presented in this document to prevent accidental releases of regulated substances or reduce the severity of those releases that do occur.\n\n1.0  POLICIES IN PLACE\n\nThe Blacksburg-VPI Sanitation Authority Waste Water Treatment Facility complies with Clean Air Act and Occupation Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) air emissions regulations and has policies in place to ensure continued compliance.\n\n2.0  SOURCE AND SUBSTANCES\n\nThe facility is responsible for treating waste water for the Town of Blacksburg and VPI&SU (SIC Code 4952, NAICS 22131). Chlorine (Chemical Abstracts Services, CAS Number 7782-50-5) is used to disinfect treated wastewater prior to discharging it into the New River. The Blacksburg-VPI Sanitation Authority stores approximately eight (8) 1-ton cylinders on site.  Sulfur Dioxide (CAS Number 7446-09-5) is used to reduce or eliminate the chlorine residual following the disinfection and prior to discharge into the New River.  The Blacksburg-VPI Sanitation Authority stores approximately four (4) to six (6) 1-ton cylinders on site.\n\n3.0  PURPOSE OF RMP SUBMISSION\n\nThe RMP was initially prepared and submitted in June 1999 and was resubmitted in June 2004.  The purpose of this RMP submission is to comply with the 5-year re-submission requirement as imposed by the EPA.  New information that is required for this submission is also included in this RMP.\n\n4.0  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility is in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and, with this document, the Clean Air Act Accidental Release Prevention Progr"
