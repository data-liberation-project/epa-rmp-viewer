      "SummaryText": "Chlorine is the most commonly used substance for disinfecting drinking water.  The addition of chlorine or chlorine compounds to water is called chlorination.  Chlorination is considered to be the most important process for preventing the spread of waterborne disease in drinking water.  The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) also uses chlorine for drinking water disinfection purposes to protect public health per state and federal water quality standards.  Storing and handling large quantities of chlorine can create hazardous situations.  LADWP takes safety obligations in storing and using chlorine as seriously as it takes providing safe drinking water.  The LADWP Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station chlorine handling process is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program and Plan and also to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program requirements.  The facilities subject to the EPA and CalARP regulations are required to prepare and update Risk Management Plans (RMPs).  The RMP is to include policies and procedures followed to safely operate the facility and the actions which will be taken by the facility in an event of an emergency.  LADWP prepared and submitted the RMPs for the Tujunga Wells facility in June 1999 and June 2004.  This RMP is the five-year update of the June 2004 RMP.  LADWP prepared a Program Level 2 RMP in 2004 because Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station was not previously subject to PSM regulations.  However, recent construction projects related to the Tujunga Wells have resulted in LADWP employees working frequently on the property.  The construction activities are temporary in nature and do not involve Chlorination Station operations, but staff have been assigned to work out of portable buildings located near the chlorination station.  Therefore, it appears that TWCS is now subject to PSM requirements.  LADWP is implementing a PSM program for TWCS, which increases the RMP Progr"

The facility is located approximately one-quarter mile east of the Hollywood Freeway (State 170) and immediately south of the Tujunga Wash River. This facility is a groundwater well field and pumping station complex.  The facility injects chlorine into a collector pipeline before entering or after leaving a 3-million gallon water contact tank.  The station consists of a chlorine storage room, a chlorination room, a chlorine control room, a tool room, and a chlorine scrubber.  The facility currently stores chlorine, a regulated toxic substance under the EPA and CalARP Program rules.  A maximum of nine one-ton chlorine containers is stored at the Tujunga Wells chlorine building.  Six of these containers can be connected to the chlorination process to feed chlorine gas and the other three containers are stored as spares.  The one-ton container is the largest vessel (container) on line. The maximum quantity of chlorine present at the Tujunga Wells Chlorination Station at any given time exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the EPA and CalARP rules.  It also exceeds the listed threshold quantities in the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standards.  The recent construction projects related to the Tujunga Wells have resulted in LADWP employees working frequently on the property.  The construction activities are temporary in nature and do not involve Chlorination Station operations, but staff have been assigned to work out of portable buildings located near the chlorination station.  Therefore, it appears that TWCS is now subject to PSM requirements.\n\nIn normal operation, four 1-ton chlorine containers are manifolded in two banks of two containers to supply chlorine.

These six containers rest on load cell scales, which allow the operators to monitor the chlorine weight in the containers.  There is also space for the storage of three additional chlorine ton containers, which can be used as spares, but are rarely used. \n\nChlorine gas is withdrawn from a bank of containers through pigtails, which are attached to the ton container gas valves.  The chlorine flows under pressure to a chlorine header to the pressure-sensitive automatic switchover valves.  The switchover valves are triggered by the rise in vacuum pressure in the chlorine feed line between the switchover valve and the chlorinator.  The rise in vacuum occurs when the chlorine container pressure approaches zero, which happens when the container is empty.  If this occurs, the switchover valve will open the alternate chlorine connection, demanding chlorine gas from the alternate chlorine containers.  The chlorine gas then leaves the switchover valve under vacuum to the chlorinators in the adjacent room.  From the chlorinators, the gaseous chlorine then travels under vacuum to three chlorine injectors in a cabinet located adjacent to an underground vault outside the station.  At the injectors, chlorine mixes with a high-pressure water supply to form a chlorine solution, which then travels to diffuser tubes located in the pipelines.\n\nProcess control is by a programmable controller that determines the feed rate relative to the residual and water flow rates.  Flow signals are transmitted to the controller.  Chlorine residual analyzers continuously monitor and record the treated water residuals.\n\nMultiple chlorine leak detectors have been installed inside the chlorine building, which alarm locally as well as at the LADWP Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant (LAAFP) at Sylmar. \n\nThe Tujunga Wells site has installed a main caustic "
