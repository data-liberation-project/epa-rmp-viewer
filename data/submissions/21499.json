Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nThe primary function of Gas Supply Resources, Inc. - York Terminal is to act as a propane distribution \nfacility.  By virtue of the flammable effects associated with propane, it is necessary to observe certain \nsafety precautions in handling propane to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to \nour own personal health as well as the health of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby \nmembers of the community.  We are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  \nSafety at our facility depends upon the manner in which we handle propane as well as on the various \nsafety devices incorporated into the design of our equipment.  Furthermore, comprehensive training \nreceived by our employees adds to the safety of our distribution facility.\nOur emergency response program is based upon the NPGA's LP-Gas Safety Handbook/ Guidlines for \nDeveloping Plant Emergency Procedures/ How to Control LP-Gas leaks and Fires.  In addition to the \npresence of appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of propane, if a release does occur, we are \ncompletely coordinated with  the Spring Garden Township Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substance Handled:\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to repackage and distrute propane to wholesale customer for use as \na fuel.  Propane arrives at our facility via rail car and transport and is stored in five (5) storage tanks.  This \nfacility has equipment for unloading rail cars and transport and equipment to load transport trucks.  This \nfacility does not load bobtails or containers.  Access to this site is restricted to authorized facility \nempolyees, authorized management p"

The maximum amount of propane that can be stored at this plant is 544,400 lbs.\n\n3.  The Flammable Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenario, Including Administrative Controls and Mitigation Measures to Limit the Distance for Each Reported Scenario:\n\nWe have calculated the worst case release scenario based on EPA's RMP Comp (TM) method.  The \nalternative release scenario analysis, we have also utilized the EPA's RMP Comp (TM) method.  The \nfollowing paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios. The worst case release scenario submitted for propane involves a catastrophic release from the storage tanks.  The scenario involves the release of 544,400 lbs. of propane.  The release quantity has been calculated with a wind speed of 1.5 meters/sec, stability class: F, and an air temperature of 25 degrees C.  The estimated distance to 1 psi overpressure is .70 miles.\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from the rail tower header piping resulting in a vapor \ncloud fire.  In this scenario 3,150 lbs. of propane is released in one minute.  This release is also controlled \nby active mitagation measures that include a monitor fire nozzle, emergency shutdown valves and manual \nvalves.  With a wind speed of 3 meters/second, stability Class: D, and an air temperature of 25 degress C.,  the estimated distance to lower flammability limit is .10 miles.\n\n4. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention \nrequirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  This facility was designed and constructed in \naccordance with NFPA-58 Standard, 1995 Edition/ NFPA-70 Standard, 1993 Edition.\nThe following sections briefly describe the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary \nsource.\n\nSafety "

The reviews focus on \noperating procedures, equipment functions, and handling practices to identify possible hazards.  Any finding  related to the hazard reviews are addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures:\n\nFor the purposes of conducting safety activities within our covered processes, Gas Supply Resources, \nInc. - York Terminal maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of \noperation such as emergency shutdown system/ startup procedures, pre-operational visual inspection \nprocedures, rail car unloading procedures, transport loading procedures, transport unloading procedures, \nand emergency shutdown system/ shutdown procedures.  The information is regularly reviewed \nand is readily accessible to operators involved with the processes.\n\nTraining:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - York Terminal has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that \nemployees are completely competent in the operating procedures associated with these processess.  New employees receive basic training in process operations followed by on-the-job supervision until they are deemed competent to work independently and have passed a written proficiency test.  Refresher training is provided yearly.\n\nMaintenance:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - York Terminal carries out documented maintenance checks on process \nequipment to ensure proper functioning.

These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt \nmanner.\n\nIncident Investigation:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - York Terminal promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or \ncould reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of propane.  These investigations are undertaken to \nidentify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from \nrecurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History:\n\nGas Supply Resources, Inc. - York Terminal has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases \nover the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental \nrelease during this period.\n\n6.
