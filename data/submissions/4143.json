To accomplish this we integrate health, safety, and environmental planning into all business activities.  This includes complying with applicable laws, responsibly managing risks, and working collaboratively with others in addressing health, safety, and environmental issues.\n\nIn the Borden Chemical, Inc. Safety Manual, the Safety Policy Statement clearly states that safety will not be compromised to achieve any other operational or business objective.  This manual defines requirements and guidelines developed to prevent injuries and accidental releases.\n\nIncluded in the Safety Manual are Emergency Response Policies that state that safety is the top priority in all emergency response situations.  This policy refers to the plant Emergency Response Plan for specific procedures for handling releases of hazardous materials.\n\n2.Stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nThis plant makes phenol-formaldehyde resins, and urea-formaldehyde resins.  The site includes two resin reactors.  Formaldehyde is used on site as a raw material for resin manufacturing. Formaldehyde is received at the facility via tank trucks.\n\nThe regulated substances used in the plant and the maximum quantities stored are:\n\nFormaldehyde       515,000 lbs.\n\n\n3.Worst-case release scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario\n\nTemperature control fails while making a batch of phenol-formaldehyde resin.  As a result, the heat of reaction boils the reactor contents until the pressure reaches 5 psig, when the installed rupture discs burst.  Pressure inside the reactor forces vapor and liquid through the rupture disc vent piping, discharging water vapor, formaldehyde vapor, and liquid resin into the atmosphere.  The distance to the EPA toxic end"

However, it is believed that some of the formaldehyde dissipates in the atmosphere without coming back to the ground         .

Alternative Release Scenario - Formaldehyde\n\nAs a result of a tank failure, formaldehyde (50%) solution spills onto the ground.  A total of  101,550  lbs. of formaldehyde is released.  The distance to the EPA toxic endpoint of 0.012 mg/L is 0.16 miles.\n\nThe spill is directed to remote containment with trenching, sloping, and berming to limit the distance to toxic endpoint.  Many other controls are in place to prevent this release.  Operations and maintenance are trained to perform inspections to recognize conditions that may lead to a storage tank failure and to take action to prevent one from occurring.  As a further safeguard, a preventive maintenance program is in place to inspect the integrity of the tank and prevent a catastrophic tank rupture.  Inventory checks, department safety checks, and a computerized maintenance work order system are "

A safety management system is in place to assure on-going compliance.  This management system includes the Safety Manual, a list of site safety responsibilities, a file system to maintain records of compliance, and a monthly Safety Committee meeting, where a management control checksheet is used to verify that tasks were completed on schedule.  The Plant Superintendent has overall responsibility for this program.\n\nThe Production Supervisor is assigned to maintain and improve the safety of their units.  Their duties include keeping operating procedures up-to-date, training operators so they can safely carry out these procedures, assuring that the plant is run safely on a daily basis, and when necessary, investigating incidents in their unit.  All employees participate in the safety program through team-based activities to improve safety and plant operation.\n\nThe Production Supervisor maintains an Operating Guide that includes process safety information, operating procedures, and a training certification program.  Operators use this Operating Guide as a training tool and for reference.  By applying the information it contains their actions will prevent accidental releases.\n\nProcess hazard analyses are conducted on an on-going basis to identify hazards and recommend safeguards that will prevent an accidental release.

For the urea-formaldehyde resin reactor, improved procedures reduce the risk of a release.\n\nTwo methods are used to assure that changes to plant equipment, procedures, or processes do not cause accidents.  For equipment and procedure changes, a Change Worksheet initiates a safety review.  This review may include process hazard analysis.  Changes to product formulations initiate a review by a chemist, process engineer, production supervisor and the plant superintendent.  Training is performed as needed to assure that those affected by the change understand its impact.  Pre-Start-up Safety Reviews are performed to assure that the plant can be started up safely after a significant change is made. \n\nA preventive maintenance program maintains the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  A computer database is used to manage the preventive maintenance schedule and other corrective or improvement repairs necessary to maintain the ongoing integrity and reliability of the facility equipment.  Each month scheduled equipment inspections, tests, or servicing are performed.  The schedule is based on plant experience to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release caused by equipment failure.\n\nThe requirements in the Safety Manual include safe work practices which prevent accidental releases.  One important section describes safety measures for welding or other \"hot\" work, which includes a permit system to reduce the risk of fire.  The Safety Manual also includes requirements for locking out equipment for maintenance.  These procedures reduce the likelihood that a valving error will lead to a release.\n\nContractors, who periodically perform work in the plant, are given safety orientations to brief them on plant hazards and safety practices.  Contractor safety programs and performance are evaluated pri"

Regional Safety and Environmental professionals also conduct  comprehensive audits of the health,safety, and environmental programs.
