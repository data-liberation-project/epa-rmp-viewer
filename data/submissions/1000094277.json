Propylene is stored on site in quantities that exceed the Threshold Quantity for\n\nPropylene. (Defined in Part 68.130 of the EPA Risk Management Program Rule)\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case release scenario for the Propylene process did not affect the public. There are no public\n\nreceptors within the distance to the end point from a worst case release scenario.The Propylene\n\nmanufacturing plant is EPA RMP Program level 1.\n\n\n\nThe accidental release prevention and emergency response policies for the Dundalk site are\n\nlocated in the Process Safety and Risk Management file. Airgas' Process Safety and Risk\n\nManagement Program provides instructions for implementing processes that produce employee\n\nparticipation, RMP related deliverables, and training activities that are compliant with 40 CFR Part\n\n68.\n\n\n\nAt the time this Executive Summary was written, the covered process had not been involved with an\n\naccidental release that could have lead to property damage, catastrophic consequence, injury, or\n\ndeath within the past 5 years. In addition, an accidental release had not lead to a response or\n\nrestoration activity for an exposure of an environmental receptor.\n\n\n\nEmployees of the Dundalk site will not respond to accidental releases of regulated substances.\n\nThe facility has an evacuation plan and has coordinated emergency response activities with\n\nDundalk, MD fire department.\n\n\n\nThe review of the Propylene PHA produced no recommendations to improve safety. At the time this\n\nExecutive Summary was written, there were no additional plans for improvement.\n\n"
