This includes a dedicated environmental, health and safety department that works together with plant operations to ensure that a program is in place such that safety and preparedness is maintained for all plant employees and the surrounding community.  In addition, Lubrizol complies with all applicable federal, state and local laws pertaining to environmental, safety and health.\n\nAs part of the safety program, all new employees go through a safety orientation program.  This includes but is not limited to the correct use of personal protection equipment, safe practices on the job and awareness and use of emergency equipment.\n\nA training program is in place to train all employees to reach and maintain proficiency in safe work practices and maintain the skills and knowledge necessary to perform their jobs.  All contractors are also required to be a part of the same safety and training programs.\n\nMany layers of protection are developed and put in place on all processes to prevent accidental releases.  Equipment is expertly designed according to strict engineering standards.  Safety reviews are conducted on new and modified processes and equipment during design and before start-up.  A maintenance and inspection program is conducted and documented to ensure facility soundness.\n\nLubrizol's ongoing process safety program includes a measurement of performance, audits and implementation of corrective actions.

All the toxic scenarios were modeled using the EPA accepted CAMEO/ALOHA air dispersion computer model.  The flammable scenarios were conducted by using the EPA's RMP Comp modeling program.\n\nOur worst-case scenario representing the toxins is failure of the storage tank of 32,000 pounds of hydrogen sulfide resulting in direct release over a ten-minute period.  Written operating procedures, administrative controls and high-level alarms prevent more than 32,000 pounds from being present in the storage tank.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nOur worst-case scenario representing the flammables is the simultaneous failure of three 29,000-gallon storage tanks of 2-methylpropene when filled to their greatest amount allowed (90%), resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Written operating procedures, administrative controls and high-level alarms prevent more than a 90% level in any of the three tanks.  The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\nBecause of all the layers of protection in place such as the safe design of the tanks, pressure and level detectors, and safe operating instructions it is highly unlikely that these worst-case scenarios would ever occur.\n\nOur alternate release scenarios are as follows:\n\nHydrogen sulfide: a gasket failure at a flange on a two-inch pipe.  With active measures in place such as excess flow valves, hydrogen sulfide sensors surrounding the process piping and vessle, and the high odor detection of hydrogen sulfide, the release duration would mostlikely be limited to 15 minutes or less.

      "SummaryText": "sly being updated as changes are needed.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nAn environmental, health and safety corrective action system was put in place to address all odors, spills and injuries that may occur at our facility.  This system identifies the root cause of the problem and a responsible party to put immediate corrective actions in place to prevent the incident from occurring again.  A system is in place to review the progress and check the effectiveness of the corrective actions.  From this there has been new training developed plant-wide that addresses a multitude of areas that will improve the overall environmental, health and safety of our facility and surrounding community. \n\nIn addition, all RMP covered processes undergo a process hazard analysis on a routine basis to identify any potential hazards.  If there are any concerns, projects are initiated to address the concerns as part of our continuous capital improvement process.  Some recent projects completed related to RMP regulated processes include upgrades to fire suppressant systems, level transmitters on vessels, replacement of liquid and vent piping, installation of safety barricades surrounding storage vessels, replacement of metering devices on material feed lines and installation of additional emergency equipment. \n\nThese are some examples of Lubrizol's philosphy of responsibly maintaining a safe environment for its employees and the surrounding community."
