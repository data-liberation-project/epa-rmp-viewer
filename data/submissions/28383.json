The quantity is limited by automatic and manual systems to half of the tank's capacity; this is the inventory reported in the Section 1.17.   Ammonia is reacted with natural gas and air in the presence of a platinum gauze to produce HCN .  It is also used in various neutralization processes around the plant.\n\nHydrogen Cyanide\nHCN is produced by the catalytic reaction of ammonia, natural gas and air over a platinum gauze.  It is stored as a refrigerated liquid in two separate, non-connected, widely-separated stainless steel tanks.  Normal inventory is limited by policy to 35% of each tank's capacity.  For major unit maintenance, the inventory in one tank is increased to 60% of capacity; this was the inventory reported in the Section 1.17.  This inventory is quickly used; the tank will be back to the normal level in 2-3 days.  The HCN is used as an intermediate in the production of methacrylic acid and its esters, methyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate.  \n\nChlorine\nChlorine is used in our Battleground Water facility to sanitize process water.  The chlorine is stored and used in one ton cylinders.  Chlorine was not covered in the 1999 RMP, because our facility only used one cylinder at a time.  A review of Chlorine Institute best practices recommended that two cylinders be used to supply our required chlorine feedrate to minimize the potential of auto-refrigeration in a cylinder.  Two cylinders will be hooked up to the feed system after the submittal of this RMP.\n\nFlammables\n\nAcetylene\nAcetylene gas is made by the partial oxidation of natural gas with pure oxygen.  It is stored as a gas under less than 1 psig in a water seal holder. The holder was replaced in 2000 with a water seal gas holder.  The bell of the holder contains the acetylene and floats in an outer shell containing 2 million gallons of water.  This is considered the current best pract"

The total quantity reported in Section 1.17 is the volume contained in both pipelines and in the vaporizers.  Propylene is used to produce acrylic acid via  partial oxidation presence of a catalyst.\n\nOur accidental release prevention programs and our contingency planning efforts help us effectively manage the hazards that are posed to our employees, the public, and the environment by our use of these chemicals.\n\nKey Offsite Consequence Analysis Scenarios\nEPA's RMP rule requires that we provide information about the worst-case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenario(s) for our facility.  The following notes about  these scenarios include information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\nThe inventory of the tank is limited to 50% of capacity by automatic level controls and the operating procedures.  The worst case for ammonia is the release of the entire tank inventory in 10 minutes.  This will result in a liquid spill and vaporization and will produce a cloud that does have offsite residential impact.\nThis scenario is unlikely because the tank has 1.5 thick steel walls, is made of stress relieved carbon steel, and is inspected periodically.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemicals\n\nAmmonia\nThe Alternative case for ammonia is a 1.5 line leak.  This will produce a cloud that will not impact public receptors other than neighboring industrial plants and Tidal road.

A vapor cloud explosion would result in an overpressure that would affect Tidal road, but would affect no other offsite receptors, not even industrial neighbors.  Because this area is unconfined, a vapor cloud fire is a more likely scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\n\nAcetylene\nThe alternative release scenario for acetylene is a leak in the 7.5 product line that lasts 10 minutes, or until mitigation measures (blocking in isolation valves, beginning to apply water spray to disperse the cloud) can be applied.

The accident scenarios found in HAZOPs form the basis of additional analyses which allow us to ensure that the integrity levels of all protective systems are high enough to protect both our employees and our neighbors.   They also help us target the most important equipment for more frequent inspection.  \n\n\u00bf Operating procedures - Operating procedures include windows for safe operations and guides for trouble shooting which allow operators to keep the processes out of unsafe areas.  Operators are involved in writing, reviewing, and updating operating procedures.\n\n\u00bf Training - Training is based on the operating instructions.  Operators help determine the frequency of refresher training.\n\n\u00bf Mechanical integrity - We have a comprehensive inspection and preventive maintenance system that ensures that equipment maintains its capability to contain the process chemicals.  This system is being continuously improved.\n\n\u00bf Management of change - Rohm and Haas Texas was a pioneer in the management of change and has a comprehensive, well-institutionalized MOC system.  Employees at all levels are involved in the operation of the MOC system.\n\n\u00bf Pre-startup review - The Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) is integral to ensuring that any new or modified process is build as intended.  It is the completion of hazard analysis to ensure that the analyses conducted are, indeed applicable to the process as built.  PSSRs are part of the institutionalized MOC and PHA systems.\n\n\u00bf Compliance audits - Several types of compliance audits are performed.  RMP/PSM self-audits are performed every three years.  VPP annual evaluations are conducted.  Corporate EHS audits are completed every 2 years.

Many technical papers and presentations came from this work.  We continue to investigate process incidents using this technique so that we can gain all the information from each incident that we can, in order to prevent future incidents and to add to the body of information about each process.\n\n\u00bf Employee participation - Employees participate in all aspects of the prevention program.  Since 1978, Rohm and Haas Texas would not perform a HAZOP unless hourly employees were present.  Operators help write operating instructions and perform much of the training for new employees.  Operators and mechanics are expected to attend MOC reviews.\n\n\u00bf Hot work permit - Rohm and Haas has had a very effective Hot Work permit system.  \n\n\u00bf Contractors - Contractors are picked according to stringent standards of management, competence, and safety.  Contractors are expected to adhere to the same standards of safety that our own employees do.  A monthly management meeting is held to review all contractors EHS performance. \n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nHydrogen Cyanide: Where possible, HCN lines are all-welded construction, and all welds are 100% X-rayed.  Where flanges are required, we use 300# flanges and spiral-wound gaskets for maximum integrity.  Pumps for 100% HCN are magnetic drive pumps which have no seals, and leaks are highly unlikely.  HCN detectors are mounted at strategic locations throughout the unit, and provide an excellent warning system.  There are evacuation procedures at each HCN unit which are tested and drilled.\n\nAmmonia:  Most of the ammonia piping is all-welded stainless steel from the metering station to the unit.

This allows maintenance to be performed at leisure on the tank that is out of service.  The tanks are made from carbon steel and both are stress-relieved.  There are excess-flow check valves in the tank outlets and in the line from the tank to the north end of the plant.  These valves will slam shut on major flow increases which would occur upon line rupture or significant leaks.\n\nChlorine:  The chlorine system feed piping was replaced in 2000 with a partial vacuum feed system.  With the partial vacuum system, leaks in the vacuum section of the system will result in a backflow preventer closing and blocking the release of chlorine.   Chlorine detectors are installed in the area surrounding the chlorine system.   \n\nAcetylene:  There are detonation arrestors on both ends of the acetylene pipeline to prevent a detonation from propagating to the holder or to our customer.  Operating conditions are controlled to prevent ignition in the holder or the pipeline.  The acetylene pipeline operates at 15-16 psig, which is far below the pressure capability of the heavy pipe used.  The pipe can contain a detonation.  Where acetylene lines can be near vehicles, the lines are 8-inch heavy construction pipe.  This line can withstand vehicle impact without damage.  There are vehicle barriers at key sections of the pipeline where vehicle impact is more likely.\n\nPropylene:  The propylene lines are welded carbon steel; one is buried, the other is above ground.  The buried pipe is coated and wrapped and is cathodically protected.  As a matter of interest, if this line leaks, the leak will be dissipated by its travel through the ground.  Unfortunately, we do not know how to model this, and the EPA lookup tables certainly cannot take this into account.
