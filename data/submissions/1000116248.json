The facility is approximately 0.27 miles South of MN-36 and 0.03 miles East of Rice Street. The area immediately surrounding the facility is urban with a mixture of light commercial, industrial, and residential areas.\n\nThe regulated material present at the facility and the focus of this study is anhydrous ammonia.\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant within a closed system. The system, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycles ammonia through various physical states (high-pressure liquid, low-pressure liquid, low-pressure vapor, high-pressure vapor, then back to high-pressure liquid) to provide refrigeration for cold storage and production.\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION\nSTEPS\n\nDairy Farmers of America \u0096 St. Paul Beverage Solutions\u0092 ammonia refrigeration system has many safety features. Much of the safety of the system is inherent in the policies and procedures that govern the operation of the system. For example, the facility operates in accordance with the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) guidelines and standards.\n\nThe facility, including the ammonia system, was designed and constructed in accordance with the Uniform Mechanical Code which specifically outlines requirements for the safe operation of the ammonia refrigeration system. The ammonia refrigeration system is equipped with various automatic process controls which ensure safe and efficient"

In addition, pressure relief valves automatically engage in the event the system experiences a very high-pressure situation. In case of an ammonia leak, ammonia detectors will provide an alert.\n\nFrom an administrative standpoint, the facility has implemented a Process Safety Management\nprogram for compliance with 29 CFR 1910.119 and a Risk Management Program for compliance\nwith 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA's RMP Program defines \"accident\" as the following:\n\n\"The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its\nthreshold quantity in the process.\n\nThe release must have caused at least one of the following:\n\nOn-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage (\u00a768.42(a)); or\n\nKnown offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place (\u00a768.42(a)).\"\n\nBased on the above definition and an investigation into the facility's accident history verified during the Process Hazard Analysis Revalidation study on October 16, 2023, there has not been a release of ammonia that meets these criteria in the past five years.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe following summarizes the emergency response and notification procedures at the facility:\n\n1. In the event of a spill, release, near miss, or threatened release involving ammonia, evacuate\nthe immediate area and report the situation to the area supervisor. If appropriate, hit the system\nemergency stop button.\n2. Area supervisor will contact the Maintenance Manager. If they are not available (e.g. off-site), then the highest ranking supervisor on-site is contacted at the front office. If needed, the Maintenance Manager is contacted using telephone calls.\n3. When the evacuation alarm sounds, all employees should follow the evacuation procedures\nand evacuate the plant to ensure their safety. Currently, the facility evacuate"
