      "SummaryText": "Facility Description    \n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora West, LLC ('the Facility') is a fuel ethanol fuel production plant located near Aurora, in Hamilton County, Nebraska. As a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments 112(r) Accidental Release of Hazardous Air Substances program, Aventine - Aurora West completed a risk management plan (RMP) for any chemical stored on-site that will be above the applicable RMP reporting threshold.\n\n\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Facility produces fuel grade ethanol from corn and a process by-product known as dry distillers' grain with solubles, which is used as a livestock feed. The fuel ethanol production process requires the use of a denaturant to render the distilled alcohol unfit for human consumption; denaturant is added to the distilled alcohol at a concentration of approximately 2 percent by volume. Aurora West uses natural gasoline as the primary denaturant for the Facility, which is an RMP-regulated flammable that may contain the following RMP-regulated components: butane, isopentane, and pentane. The maximum amount of denaturant on-site is estimated to be 680,328 pounds (105,200 gallons). The denaturant is stored in an above ground tank as a liquid and is blended into the fuel ethanol prior to shipping. The denaturant tank is located in the Facility's tank farm area which includes secondary containment. The Facility also stores aqueous ammonia (30% maximum concentration) on-site in an above ground tank located within secondary containment. Aqueous ammonia is used in the ethanol production process for pH control and a nutrient for the yeast during fermentation. The maximum ammonia stored will be 528,129 pounds based on total gallons (70,700 gallons).  \n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nAurora West is committed to the protection of its employees, the greater community and the environment from hazardous substances used in the ethanol fuel production process, specifically the flammable mixture na"

      "SummaryText": "tural gasoline (RMP-regulated components: butane, isopentane, and pentane), as well as aqueous ammonia. Both the denaturant and the aqueous ammonia are stored in secondary containment to minimize the potential for off-site migration of spilled material and to allow for prompt response in the event of a material release. It is the policy of Aurora West to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. In the event of an emergency, including accidental release of denaturant or aqueous ammonia, it is the policy of Aurora West to notify the Hamilton County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Aurora Fire department.  \n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nAurora West maintains a consistent accidental release prevention program to eliminate or minimize releases of denaturant and aqueous ammonia. As previously indicated, the Prevention Program required under 40 CFR 68 is very similar to the prevention program required under OSHA's PSM. Aurora West's Prevention Program 3 elements, as required under 40 CFR 68 Subpart D, are included in the Facility's PSM/RMP Plan.  \n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\nPacific Ethanol Aurora West has not had any accidental releases from denaturant or aqua ammonia that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nThe Emergency Response Program requirements for Program 3 Facilities are very similar to those required under the PSM rule. Rather than prepare a complete Emergency Response Plan, Aurora West has chosen to maintain a written Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that provides guidance to ensure employee safety in the event of an emergency. In general, the EAP provides procedures for employees to report a fire or other emergency; procedures for emergency evacuation; procedures to for employees who remain to operate critical plant operations prior "

      "SummaryText": "to evacuation; contact information for employees responsible for communicating plan information; details regarding the employee alarm system; an employee training program for evacuation; and procedures for routine review and updates to the plan. The Facility has coordinated with the Hamilton County LEPC and is a part of the written community Emergency Response Plan. The Aurora Fire Department will provide first response for all Facility emergencies. For these reasons, Aurora West meets the exceptions listed in 40 CFR 68.90(b) and therefore the Facility is not required to have the Emergency Response Program of 40 CFR 68.95. A site map, SDSs, and a list of chemicals kept on-site are maintained at the Facility. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAurora West is a newer facility and has been built with features to ensure safe operation of both the flammable and ammonia processes. Aurora West completed a Process Hazard Analysis prior to bringing toxic or flammable materials on site above RMP thresholds and recently completed a revalidation of the initial PHA.  The Facility is in the process of implementing the changes recommended during the recent Process Hazard Analysis revalidation and Compliance Audit.\n\n"
