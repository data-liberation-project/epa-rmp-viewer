The facility's designed, installed, and maintained and operated to utilize current technology, safety, and control devices to ensure effective adnsafe operation, emergency shutdown, and fire prevention and fire fighting etc. The facility has developed it's own emergency response procedure/plan, and has trained the personnel.\nTHE FACILTY AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED.\nThe facility is owned and operated by Nikkiso Cryo, Inc. It is a cryogenic pump testing facility, using refrigerated liquified natural gas (LNG) OR refrigerated liquified petroleum gas (LPG, i.e refrigerated liquid propane or refrigerated liquid butane) as pump testing mediums. The on-site liquid is stored in two horizontal cylindrical tanks. The system consists of two cryogenic storage tanks for refrigerated testing fluid, three storage tanks for liquid nitrogen(LN2, used for coolinf and purging, a non-regulated substance), two testpump vessels, a re-circulation vessel, two transfer pumps, associated piping, valves, heat exchangers, control system, etc. IT SHOULD BE NOTED that the facility can only have one regulated substance on site  AT ANY GIVEN SINGLE TIME, due to the fact that the facility has only one system set which can handle only one testing fluid at a time. The regulated substance handled is either methane, which is the major component of LNG, OR propane, OR butane. After the completion of each test the testing fluid is transported away from the facility, and the system is purged with liquid mitrogen (LN2) in preparation for the next test. Methane, propane, and butane are all non-toxic, flammable, and clean burning gases. The maximum allowed invento"

The resulting endpoint of 1 psi overpressure (TNT equivqlency method) is 0.081 miles and extends off site. The facility is located in an industrial park. Within the circle with a radius of 0.081 miles there are no residences, but other publis receptors such as employees in the neighboring facilities. The maximum total number of the public population within the circle is 85. It should be noted that no explosion of inconfined methane vapor cloud has ever happened, nor is it considered a credible accident.\nBased on LNG industry experience and by using EPA's 40CFR68 and OCA guidance, it is determind that the alternative release scenario is a leak in the system, resulting in a liquid pool in the spill containment sump as described n the worst case scenario above. The liquid evaporates  to form a vapor cloud which ignites to form a vapor cloud fire burning back to the pool to from a reduced size of pool fire. It is conservatively assumed that the liquid in the pool is enough to cover the containment surface and the depth of the pool is more than 1 mc. The liquid amount in a pool 450 sq. ft. by 1 cm deep is about 390 lbs. Manual emergency shutdown is"

The evaporating/release rate is calculated by using the containment surface area of 450 sq. ft. and the wind speed of 3.0 meters/second. The result is 159.13 lbs/minute. Because the release duration does not need to be consideredfor estimating vapor cloud fire distances, the liquid amount in the pool does make any difference in the result of such estimating. By using the tables in OCA guidancethe distance to the endpoint of LFL is estimated as 0.06 miles. The public population situation is essentially the same that in the worst case release scenario.\nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe facility complies with the CAPP of the State of Nevada. It also complies with all applicable state and local codes and regulations. It is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with NFPA and state law. The facility has and adheres to it's detailed operating procedures including safety checks during operation and other written procedures on safety, employee training, maintenance, etc.\nTHE FIVE YEAR ACIDENT HISTORY\nThe facilty has never had and accident involving LNG or LPG or the vapors from either that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\nTHE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe facility has emergency response procedures in it's own \"Emergency Response Plan\", although it does not have an emergency response program as defined by EPA's Risk Management Program because employee responding action is not required. All the emergency response procedures were reviewed in April 2004. The personnel have been trained to follow the procedures when an emergency situation occurs.
