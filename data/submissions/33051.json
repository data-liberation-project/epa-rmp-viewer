It is the policy of SMBSC to comply with all Federal, State and Local laws.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substance Handled\n\nThe SMBSC operates a beet sugar processing and refining facility in Renville, Renville County, Minnesota.  The facility's principal products are beet sugar, beet pulp pellets and molasses by-products.  The sugar beet refining process requires the use of sulfur dioxide to control pH and color.  The maximum amount of sulfur dioxide stored on-site is estimated to be 146,000 pounds.  The sulfur dioxide is stored as a liquid and is vaporized via an evaporator for process usage.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThrough completion of this RMP, SMBSC has complied with the EPA requirements under 40 CFR 68.  Process safety information and operations/maintenance procedures are documented on site.  Periodic functions such as process hazard analysis, training, change management and incident investigation are conducted on a regular basis.  Audits of the overall RMP will be conducted on a regular basis to assure compliance with EPA regulations.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nSMBSC has not had a sulfur dioxide accident causing deaths, injuries, environmental or property damage, evacuations, or in-place sheltering in the last five years at the sugar beet processing facility.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program\n\nIn the event of an emergency, it is the policy of SMBSC to notify the local (City of Renville) Fire Department and evacuate all employees from the facility."
