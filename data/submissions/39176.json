The United Dairy, Fike?s Division PSM/RMP program focuses attention on \"Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system\" rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Engine Room Manager and the Principle Chief Refrigeration Engineer, have been deeply involved and they (along with the Refrigeration System Operators) assume the major responsibility for operating the Hazardous Material process safely.\n\n     The United Dairy, Fike?s Division Emergency Response Program has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of the local Public Emergency Response Agency.

PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\n      United Dairy, Fike?s Division recognizes that even good PSM/RMP Programs require constant attention and improvement.  The PSM/RMP program is considered to be a set of \"living\" documents and procedures that will require constant attention, development, and revision before \"Safety\" truly becomes \"second nature\".\n\n     United Dairy, Fike?s Division expects to improve PSM/RMP and safety performance by emphasizing the following elements of their PSM/RMP Program:\n\n (1)   Employee Participation is the \"Key\" to a successful program. Ammonia Process Managers and Operators have been deeply involved in Verifying P&ID's, Developing and updating the Standard Operating Procedures, and performing the documented Preventive Maintenance Inspections.\n\n(2)    The United Dairy, Fike?s Division PSM/RMP Program is:  (a) computer based,  (b)user friendly,  (c) includes \"one-on-one\" involvement with specified and qualified trainers,  (d) written to minimize paperwork and maximize documentation, and  (e) written to be understood and used by both Ammonia Managers and Process Operators. \n\n(3)   All recommendations developed during the PROCESS HAZARD ANALYSIS (PHA) were designed to improve the safety performance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System.  United Dairy, Fike?s Division expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n(4)  Programs are audited regularly to improve the process as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations."
