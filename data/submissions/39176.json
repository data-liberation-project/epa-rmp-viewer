ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n     United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division recognizes management's responsibility in protecting it's employees, equipment, property, and the environment. The safety and health of all personnel are very important.  The control of ammonia release incidents has been and will continue to be the basic responsibility of all United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division personnel who operate the ammonia refrigeration process.\n\n     The United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division PSM/RMP program assigns and documents the specific responsibilities for developing, implementing and integrating the OSHA PSM and the EPA RMP standards into its Ammonia Operating and Management Systems.  The United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division PSM/RMP program focuses attention on Making PSM/RMP the way we manage our ammonia based refrigeration system rather than a project we expect to complete and put on the shelf when the filing date has passed.\n\n     United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division believes that Employee Participation is the key to a successful PSM/RMP program.  Operating level employees, particularly the Engine Room Manager and the Principle Chief Refrigeration Engineer, have been deeply involved and they (along with the Refrigeration System Operators) assume the major responsibility for operating the Hazardous Material process safely.\n\n     The United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division Emergency Response Program has been developed in cooperation, and with the support of the local Public Emergency Response Agency.  All United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division employees have received documented emergency response training.\n\n\nII.  STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n     United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division operates an Ammonia Refrigeration System.  Ammonia is a common industrial chemical with applications in a large number of industries such as Agriculture, Water Treatment, Food Storage Warehouses, Pharmaceuticals, Heat Treating and many, many more.  Ammonia has been listed by both EPA and OSHA a"

United Dairy, Fike\u00bfs Division expects to evaluate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release.\n\n(4)  Programs are audited regularly to improve the process as well as to verify compliance with the PSM/RMP Regulations."
