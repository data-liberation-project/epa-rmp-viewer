One of the major chemical ingredients used in the PU foam manufacturing process is Toluene diisocyanate (mixed isomers) (TDI), CAS #  26471-62-5. Our TDI inventory is maintained above 10,000 lbs.  In accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 68 (Chemical Accident Prevention Regulations), the worst case scenario was defined as the rupture of, and the immediate spillage of, the contents of a TDI railcar into a concrete containment area.  The impact of this spill was evaluated using the ALOHA model and resulted in the area of concern being confined within the facility's property boundary with no public receptors being affected.  The release rate calculated by the ALHOA model was 0.0239 lbs./min.  \n\nThis facility has an OSHA HAZWOPER trained Hazmat Team, which will provide initial response to any and all spills, despite the substance or size.  \n\nThis facility also has contracted professional emergency responders as back-up. This facility's Emergency Response Plan has been coordinated with the LEPC and the local fire department.  All facility employees responsible for the handling and control of hazardous substances are provided initial and refresher training in proper procedures as required by the USEPA, OSHA and DOT regulatory requirements.\n\nThere have been no accidents with regard to spillage of RMP substances at this facility within the last five years.\n\nNo changes to t"
