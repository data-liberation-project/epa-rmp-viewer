Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nSt. Joseph Foods' at Mitchell Avenue, in St. Joseph, Missouri complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program Rule (40 CFR Part 68), OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119) and OSHA Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) rules (29 CFR 1910.120).  The enclosed Risk Management Plan addresses the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68 as they relate to the storage, handling, and processing of a highly hazardous chemical, ammonia.  Through our compliance with Part 68 and 29 CFR 1910, we promote overall plant, worker, and community safety.  Our Risk Management Program enables our facility to prevent the occurrence and minimize consequences of significant releases of ammonia, including leaks, spills, fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents. \n\nIn order to reduce the likelihood and severity of accidental chemical releases that may affect on-site workers and off-site populations and environmental receptors, the Company policy is to fully comply with the letter of EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions rules (40 CFR Part 68).  The Company has developed a formal Risk Management Plan in compliance with 40 CFR Part 68.  All employees are expected to understand their role in developing and implementing the plan and to diligently adhere to its provisions.  The St. Joseph facility's Risk Management System has clearly defined lines of authority and designation of responsibilities to ensure that the risk management plans are developed, implemented, and revised.  St. Joseph Foods' safety and risk programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.\n\n\n2.  Facility and Regulated Chemical Description\n\nSt. Joseph Foods' meat processing facility, located at 5807 Mitchell Avenue, St. Joseph, Missouri, is subject to the requi"

      "SummaryText": "rements of 40 CFR Part 68, the Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions (112(r)) of the Clean Air Act, due to one on-site process containing a regulated chemical above its threshold quantities.  Anhydrous ammonia, a regulated toxic substance, is present in the facility refrigeration system in a quantity greater than its 10,000 pound threshold as established in the 112(r) regulations.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is present as the refrigerant in the plant refrigeration system.  Preparation of the meat products, packaging, and storage operations require refrigeration to keep raw ingredients and products fresh. The system consists of high pressure tanks, compressors, piping, pumps, chillers, and associated equipment located at various strategic locations throughout the plant.  The ammonia may exist as a gas or as a liquid in different parts of the system.  The total amount of ammonia present in the refrigeration system is approximately 68,800 pounds which represents the maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia held in this process.  The maximum amount held in the single receiver is 20,554 lbs which is the maximum amount available for release as a worst case.  Because the overall system is pressurized, it is considered a single process.\n\n\n3.  Worst-Case and Alternative Case Scenarios\n\nAmmonia\n\nWorst-Case Scenario:  Failure of the receiver when the system is fully pressurized and filled to maximum inventory.  The entire contents of the receiver (20,554 lbs) are assumed to be released as vapor over ten minutes as per regulatory guidance.  The distance to the toxic concentration endpoint of 0.14 mg/L for the worst-case scenario is beyond the fenceline and therefore has the potential for offsite impacts.\n\nAlternative Scenario:  A safety relief valve does not reseat properly resulting in a release of ammonia.  The safety relief valve loses ammonia over a period of 10 minutes during which the leak is detected and mitigated.  The distance to the toxic concentration endpoint of 0.14 mg/L is be"

The occurrence of this scenario is unlikely because operating procedures to prevent such an occurrence are in place and employees and drivers are trained to ensure that proper operating procedures are followed.\n\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe St. Joseph facility complies with EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provision rules and OSHA safety rules under 29 CFR 1910 for ammonia.  All elements of the accidental release prevention requirements under Part 68 have been developed and implemented for ammonia at the St. Joseph facility.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system was designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigerating Systems.  A process hazard review was conducted for ammonia  using a \"What-If Checklist\" and all identified problems were addressed.  Written operating procedures associated with all facets of ammonia storage, handling, and transfer are in place.  All persons working with ammonia or ammonia containing equipment have been trained on operating procedures and understand the consequences of deviation from the procedures.  A mechanical integrity program is in place for ammonia refrigeration equipment and operations.\n\n\n5.  Five-year Accident History\n\nBecause this is a new system, no accidental releases of ammonia have occurred during the last five years that resulted in offsite impacts of any kind.\n\n\n6.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe emergency response program at the St. Joseph facility is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  The plan is coordinated with the Buchanan County (Missouri) Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the St. Joseph Fire Division.  The St. Joseph Food emergency respons"
