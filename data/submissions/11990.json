Program 3 related information for the Process Mill/Steephouse, Modhouse, and Speciality Starch departments is included in the Data Elements section of the Risk Management Plan.\n\n2.1 Process Mill/Steephouse Department\n\nThe corn milling process at the Cargill Cedar Rapids facility is designed to extract useable starch and sugars from corn kernels in order to produce various end-products. The first step in the corn milling process involves steeping the corn kernels.  During steeping the corn is covered with water into which liquid SO2 has been injected.  The SO2 and water form a dilute solution of sulfurous acid that helps to soften the kernel, breakdown proteins and remove soluble constituents. The steeped corn then travels through degerminating mills and separation processes designed to remove the germ and separate out the starch.  In the final step, the starch slurry is rinsed in water into which additional liquid SO2 is injected.  Approximately 80% of this starch slurry is utilized in the production of corn syrup and starch.  \n\nThe Process department is responsible for the storage and transfer of sulfur dioxide (SO2) that is utilized in the corn milling process. The SO2 is stored in an exterior storage tank as a pure liquefied gas at ambient temperatures. The nominal capacity of the tank is 28,000 gallons (341,600 lb).  Administrative controls and interlocks limit the maximum amount stored at any time to 311,100 lbs.  The storage tank is filled approximately every 25 days via 90-ton railcar.  During rail disruption SO2 is received via truck.  Access to the unloading area is limited by chain link fence and secured by locks.  Only 1 railcar of SO2 is allowed on site at any time.\n\n2.2 Modhouse Department\n\nEthylene oxide i"

The ERPG-2 is defined as:\n\nthe maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hr without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\n\nGiven that the worst-case is a 10-minute release duration with a 10-minute averaging time, the actual hazard zone is typically overestimated by the ERPG-2. Within such a time period there are a number of emergency measures that can reduce or eliminate exposures to levels this high for an interval much shorter than an hour. \n\nBased on a review of the quantity of regulated substance stored in vessels on-site, it was estimated that sulfur dioxide would result in the greatest distance to toxic endpoint.  The toxic endpoint for SO2 is 0.0078 mg/L.  Since the resulting planning zone predicted for the worst-case SO2 toxic release potentially affects public receptors, regulated processes at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility are subject to Program 3 requirements.  40 CFR Part 68 requires that the substance with the largest distance to toxic endpoint be reported in the Worst-Case Release section of the Risk Management Plan.  Therefore, only the SO2 release results are included in the Data Elements section. \n\nThe EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG) lists a number of refined dispersion models that are available for off-site hazard assessment applications for risk management programs.  Sulfur dioxide has a molecular weight that is substantially greater than the ambient air.  Therefore, concentrated plumes of this substance resulting from accidental releases often display heavy-gas behavior.  In such cases, near-field dispersion is dominated by gravitational slumping of the plume and entrainment of air at the plume-air interface.  T"

If a hole were to form in the vapor space of the storage tank, the flashing vapor in the tank would cause the tank to auto-refrigerate, thereby gradually reducing the release rate with time.  However, Cargill evaluated this 10-minute release to comply with the noted regulation.\n\n3.2 Alternative Releases of Toxic Substances\n\nAlternative releases are intended to represent release scenarios that have a greater likelihood of occurrence than a worst-case release.  Alternative releases do not necessarily represent the types of releases that the PSM hazards analysis and/or accident history indicate would be most frequent, but rather a release that is somewhat more likely than the worst-case release and that generally still has the potential to affect off-site receptors. In accordance with the EPA's OCAG, a single alternative release scenario is reported for each regulated substance. \n\nCargill performed a thorough review of the Process Mill/Steephouse, Modhouse, and Specialty Starch departments, utilizing engineering plans, operational experience, and maintenance records, in order to determine alternative release scenarios that could potentially result in off-site impacts. Each scenario was evaluated and the scenarios most likely to occur and to result in off-site impacts were selected for modeling. In order to determine the most conservative off-site consequence estimates, Cargill has chosen to include in the Risk Management Plan the alternative release scenarios that resulted in the greatest toxic endpoint distance for each regulated substance.\n\nIn accordance with the RMP rule, alternative releases are modeled under typical (rather than worst-case) dispersion conditions.

Unlike the worst-case release (for which an instantaneous spill or 10-minute ground-level gas release is assumed), alternative scenarios can account for the actual release configuration, and account for both active and passive mitigation.  Alternative dispersion modeling was conducted using EPA's RMP Off-site Consequence Analysis Guidance (1999 Revised OCAG), and RMP Guidance for Chemical Distributors.  \n\n3.2.1 Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe alternative SO2 release scenario that would result in the greatest off-site impact involves a break in the SO2 unloading assembly at the delivery railcar. A break of this type would result in a hole in the unloading assembly of approximately 1.0 inches in diameter.  The pressurized release of SO2 through hole of this size would result in two-phase flow (vapor and liquid) as the pressurized SO2 flashed to the vapor state.   The modeling showed that SO2 would be released at a rate of 1,600 lbs/min.  It is conservatively assumed that the sulfur dioxide would then be dispersed as a heavy gas and the excess flow valve would not engage.  Cargill has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 30 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of SO2, resulting in a total release of 48,000 lbs.  This alternative SO2 release scenario is expected to be more representative of the maximum anticipated release at the facility than the worst-case.  \n\nThe modeling indicates that under urban conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would be 0.6 miles. The hazard impact zone encompasses an estimated residential population of approximately 1,800 persons, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated in conjunction with EPA's Landview III database program.

The release rate for this scenario was conservatively estimated to be 660 lbs/min, using the EPA's OCAG.  Although a release of this type could potentially occur, the frequency at which the hoses are replaced reduces the likelihood of a release to a very low level. Cargill has estimated that it would take an operator approximately 30 minutes to respond and shutdown the flow of ethylene oxide, resulting in a total release of 19,800 lbs. \n\nThe modeling indicates that under 'urban' conditions, the distance to toxic endpoint would be 0.8 miles.

The raw materials and process chemicals utilized by the plant are delivered via truck and rail from external sources.  Access to the site by vendors, employees, and visitors is controlled by fencing and security check points.  Several of the chemicals utilized in the corn milling process at the Cedar Rapids facility are regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  The Process Mill/Steephouse, Modhouse, and Specialty Starch departments each store and maintain chemicals that are present at or above threshold amounts for regulated substances. These departments contain the only processes at the facility that are subject to the above regulation, which addresses the potential off-site hazards of accidental releases.  The regulated substances include: sulfur dioxide (SO2), ethylene oxide (EO), and propylene oxide (PO).\n\nThe EPA Risk Management Regulation identifies three levels of requirements for industrial processes.  Program 1 can be applied to any process which has not had a significant release of a regulated substance over the five year period prior to the June 1999 compliance date and for which the worst-case release does not affect public receptors (e.g., residences, parks and recreation areas, commercial/industrial facility, hospitals).  Program 2 applies to any process that is ineligible for Program 1 and is not subject to Program 3.  Program 3 applies to all processes, such as those present at the Cargill Corn Milling Division facility, that are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safet"

EO is delivered approximately every 14 days via a dedicated railcar with a capacity of 24,500 gallons. Use of a dedicated railcar reduces the potential of contamination by another substance, which can cause polymerization and heating leading to over pressurization.  Only one railcar at a time is allowed in the unloading area.  The storage tank has a capacity of 25,650 gallons based on administrative controls.  From the storage tank, EO is sent to the batch tank and then reactor vessels to be used in the production of ethylated starch.  Access to the EO area is limited by chain link fence and secured by locks.\n\n2.3 Specialty Starch Department\n\nThe Specialty Starch Department is responsible for the storage and transfer of propylene oxide that is used in the production of propylated starch.  The propylene oxide is stored in an underground storage tank that never contains more than 9,500 gallons.  PO is delivered approximately every 10 days via a 6,500 gallon tank truck.  The underground storage tank has a capacity of 9,500 gallons based on administrative controls.

In order to standardize and simplify the many factors that can potentially occur in an accidental release situation, some of these assumptions may not take into account the available preventive measures or mitigation methods that could diminish or even eliminate the implied risks that are suggested by worst-case analyses. For that reason, both the results for the standardized worst-cases defined by the EPA methods and a set of alternative cases which are believed by Cargill to more realistically represent situations that may possibly, but rarely, occur within the lifetime of the facility are also presented. The sections of the Risk Management Plan which discuss both worst-case, and alternative cases, are meant to provide the data necessary to develop and evaluate possible improvements in the overall safety programs of the Cargill RMP program. \n\n3.1 Worst-Case Release for Toxic Substances\n\nThe worst-case release scenario, as defined by 40 CFR Part 68, is a sudden release of the maximum amount of a stored regulated substance from a single vessel, regardless of whether several vessels are interconnected.  For toxic gases such as SO2 and EO stored at ambient temperatures, it is assumed that the release occurs over a 10-minute period.  Toxic liquids, like PO, are assumed to spill instantaneously and spread to a depth of 1 cm in an undiked area or to cover a diked area.  The duration of the release is based on the evaporation rate of the toxic liquid and the amount spilled.  The regulated substance with the most extensive zone of influence, defined as the distance to specified toxic endpoints, is considered the worst-case release for each facility.  Only passive mitigation (e.g., dikes, enclosures) and administrative controls may be accounted for in the evaluation.\n\nEPA has established toxic endpoints for various chemicals based on the American Industrial Hygiene Association (ACGIH) Emergency Response Planning Guideline,"

      "SummaryText": "he Dense Gas DISpersion (DEGADIS) Model (Version 2.1) was developed by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Gas Research Institute to model dense gas releases and its use has been approved by the U.S. EPA.  The model is used to predict the dispersion of dense gases from ground level releases over flat, level terrain.  For these reasons, DEGADIS was used to model the worst-case release scenarios.\n\nThe 1999 Revised OCAG provides a basic approach to estimating endpoint distances based on an ambient air temperature of 77oF.  However, the RMP rule requires that if dispersion techniques other than the OCAG are applied, the maximum daily temperature over the last three years be used.  A review of National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) climatological data for the National Weather Service reporting station at Waterloo, IA, indicated a recorded high temperature over the last three years of 99oF.  \n\nUnder Section 68.22 (e), the RMP rule identifies surface roughness as a parameter to be specified in the hazard assessment. The surface roughness affects the amount of dispersion that occurs within a released plume and influences the distance to toxic endpoint. The surface roughness used in determining the distance to toxic endpoint should be characteristic of the transport path of the plume from the release point to the endpoint distance.  'Urban' surface roughness indicates areas where there are many obstacles, such as industrial buildings or trees.  'Rural' indicates that there are no buildings in the immediate vicinity of a facility and that the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.  In the immediate vicinity of the Cargill Corn Milling facility, the aerodynamic surface roughness is clearly 'urban' in nature.  Then, depending on direction, the land use is both urban and rural.  To the south-southeast of the plant, the land use is primarily rural.  Otherwise, surrounding land use is urban.  For this analysis, an 'urban' surface roughness value of 50 cm, which is consistent with"

Analysis of three years of meteorological data from the National Weather Service at Waterloo, IA indicates that these dispersion conditions occur approximately 6% of the time (or about 1.4 hours per day, on average). The most predominant directions of transport are to the northwest and southeast. \n\n3.1.1 Worst-Case Release: Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe 40 CFR, Part 68 prescribed worst-case scenario for the Cedar Rapids facility consists of a 10-minute gaseous ground-level release of 311,100 lbs of stored sulfur dioxide, dispersed under atmospheric conditions of F stability and 1.5 m/sec wind speed.  The modeling results indicated that the worst-case SO2 release would result in a distance to toxic endpoint of 10. miles.  The worst-case impact zone encompasses a resident population of approximately 150,000, based on the 1990 Federal Census, and estimated by applying EPA's Landview III program.  Public receptors were identified using 1:24,000 scale U.S.G.S maps, supplemented with comprehensive maps of the local Cedar Rapids area (Rand McNally, 1990, and DeLorme Street Atlas USA, Version 5).   The potential worst-case hazard zone includes schools, hospitals, prisons, public recreation areas, and industrial/commercial areas. Several environmental receptors (defined as National or State parks, forests, officially designated wildlife sanctuaries, preserves, refuges, and federal wilderness areas) are also located within the worst-case impact zone.  The closest environmental receptor is the Palisades Kepler State Park.  \n\nCargill notes that it is impossible to release 311,100 lbs of SO2 in 10 minutes because the amount of heat energy required to so rapidly vaporize the liquid SO2 would not be available.  If the storage tank were to breach, liquid"
