      "SummaryText": "The St. James Water Plant #1 stores a maximum of 2 one-ton cylinders of chlorine in the rear of the operations building. The storage area is an enclosed independent building for housing chlorine. There are chlorine danger signs posted. Only one chlorine gas container is in operation at any time with another on stand-by. The chlorine gas flows through a Regal switch-over vacuum chlorine regulator and is piped to a rotometer. It is mixed with water and then piped to the two treatment plants. The chlorine gas flows through a vacuum system that shuts off the gas if there is any condition that breaks off the vacuum such as  gas leak. A chlorine sensor and alarm system is located where the two one-ton containers are situated. This system will alert the operator on duty of a chlorine release. When an empty on-ton container is being taken out of operation, there are two water plant operator personnel present, the individual performing the task and the other as an emergency response individual.\n\n\n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was a full release of a one-ton cylinder, Chlorine release quantity, release rate, release duration, wind, speed, distance to end point, residential population and public receptor impact were calculated using RMP Comp. The Alternate Case Scenario was the Ruptured Disc/Relief Valve failure resulting in 1000 pounds of chlorine gas.\n\n\n\nThe Prevention Program consists of the following items: \n\na. Keep all equipment dealing with the chlorine system in good working condition. \n\nb. Train the water plant operators in prevention and emergency procedures. \n\nc. Respond quickly to the near accident occurrences and determine the causes and corrective actions needed. \n\nd. Run Hazard reviews and Compliance Audits at least on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\nProcedures are in place to ensure the integrity of the cylinders being delivered and stored on site. The procedure to change cylinders is reviewed periodically with plant personnel. All operators are required to earn at least a Class"

Continue training of all water plant personnel in chlorine knowledge, safety, release prevention and emergency procedures, and \n\n2. Further investigate means of limiting the distance that the chlorine gas will travel."
