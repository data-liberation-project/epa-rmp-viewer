The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning & Response section of the PSM / RMP documents which is maintained by the Facility Maintenance Manager at the facility.\n\nThis program contains procedures detailing how the facility will respond to accidental ammonia releases and other emergencies such as fires, earthquakes, power outages, etc.  This program has been coordinated with the local emergency service agencies including: the City of Industry Fire Department, Los Angeles County Fire Department + HazMat Team, and the local emergency management services agency.\n\nThe facility\u0092s Emergency Action Plan Policy includes the following elements:\n\n  --  Key Facility Personnel and Responsibilities\n  --  Outside Agency Notification Contact Information\n  --  Detailed Action Plans for Internal Departments\n  --  First Aid Procedures\n  --  Emergency Medical Treatment Procedures\n  --  Evacuation Plans + Assembly Areas\n  --  Description for Handling Small Ammonia Releases\n  --  Details of Outside Assistance Available \n  --  Incident Command System\n  --  Initial and Refresher Training\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nFreshpoint Southern California is committed to the safety of employees, contractors/guests/visitors, as well as neighbors.

All pressure-rated vessels are equipped with mechanical pressure relief valves that automatically engage in case of a high pressure situation and vent to a water diffusion tank that is available to neutralize high pressure ammonia.\n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion.  The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through stages of liquid to vapor to liquid, similar to the refrigerant in a household refrigerator.  The refrigeration system is a closed-loop system without any regular emissions or releases.  Any leaks are noted and repaired immediately.\n\nContinued safety improvement for the ammonia refrigeration system is a top priority for Freshpoint Southern California.  The management plan, internal audits, Process Hazard Analysis studies, as well as our risk management policies are monitored and updated as appropriate to ensure that all elements of our PSM / RMP program remain accurate and complete.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nEPA\u0092s RMP regulation defines \u0093accident\u0094 as the following: \n\n\u0093The release must be from a covered process and involve a regulated substance held above its threshold quantity in the process.

To help coordinate the various elements of the program, a management system has been established that defines responsible parties at the facility for each element of the facility\u0092s PSM / RMP program.  The facility utilizes the services of a local professional refrigeration contractor for routine inspections / testing / maintenance activities, as well as service calls.  The preventative maintenance program is based on manufacturer recommendations, as well as industry standards and guidelines.\n\nIn the event of an accidental ammonia release, the emergency response plan is coordinated with the local emergency planning commission (LEPC) and the local fire house \u0096 Los Angeles County Fire Department Station 87.  The ultimate goal for Freshpoint Southern California\u0092s PSM / RMP plan is to prevent accidental releases of ammonia, injuries / illnesses, and to avoid adverse impacts to the environment.

Ammonia leak detectors are calibrated semi-annually and trigger local audible + visual alarms for facility personnel.\n\nRefrigeration process equipment at the facility operates continuously based on temperature readings in the warehouse.  The compressors and condensers cycle on and off to address system heat load demands during operation.  The refrigeration machinery room houses the compressors, recirculator and accumulator vessels, and auxiliary components, while the condenser is located on a raised platform outside.  Evaporators are located in various cold storage and dock rooms throughout the building.\n\nAmmonia is used as the primary refrigerant, which means it is used as a vehicle to move heat from cold storage zones to the outside atmosphere.  When heat is absorbed by the liquid ammonia, it vaporizes (changes phase), and is then compressed by the compressors.  The resulting high pressure ammonia vapor is routed to the condensers, where fans and sprayed water are used to reject latent heat in the ammonia vapor, causing it to condense to a liquid.\n\nMultiple auxiliary systems are in place to support the operational and safety requirements of the ammonia system including:  ammonia leak detection, auto purger to remove non-condensible gasses, pressure relief system, refrigeration control system, and a water diffusion tank that neutralizes any ammonia vapor vented through a pressure relief valve.  An Emergency Refrigerant Control Box is also available and can be used to reduce pressures on the high pressure side of the system.\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTo deal with the risks involved with ammonia refrigeration systems, policies and programs have been developed for the Freshpoint Southern California facility to limit the risks of an accidental ammonia release and/or minimize the consequences of a significant release, fires, explosions, and other types of ca"

The facility is located approximately 1.8 miles east of Interstate 605 freeway, and approximately 1.5 miles north of CA State Highway 60, and just north of Valley Boulevard.\n\nFreshpoint Southern California is a cold storage logistics facility that receives, sorts, and distributes cold food products.

The maximum intended inventory of ammonia at the facility is approximately 12,000 pounds.\n\nThe accidental release prevention program starts with good operating and safe work practices.  All ammonia process equipment, piping, and valves are inspected and maintained on a regular schedule by a professional refrigeration contractor in accordance with manufacturer and industry recommendations.\n\nFor example, all compressors are routinely inspected for oil leaks, pressure and temperature gauge calibrations, vibration analysis, oil pressure, and amp reading for motors;  alignment of compressor motors and bearings, filter changes, vibration readings are performed on compressor motors;  the condensers are routinely inspected and cleaned (this includes checking and cleaning nozzles and strainers), motors are greased, fans are checked for cracks, and piping is inspected for leaks;  oil pots are drained, pump bearing wear is monitored;  visual inspection for equipment and vessel operating conditions, piping and valves are assessed for leaks, integrity, and other potential abnormalities on daily basis;  pre"
