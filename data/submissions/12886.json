Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been no accidental release during this period.\nSteps to Improve Safety: Several developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program. Installation of additional production area ammonia sensors, increased employee training, and expansion of the present HAZMAT team to encompass all production shifts. These are some of the major steps to improve safety at our facility.  \n\nIn addition, the facility will continue to operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the Risk Management Program.\n\n DEANS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY"

      "SummaryText": "the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint. The worst case release scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the control-pressure vessel is released. The release scenario was performed assuming that the vessel was filled to ninety (90) per cent of full tank volume of liquid ammonia (the greatest amount that would ever be placed in the vessel). The vessel, however, is normally filled to twenty-eight (28) percent, which is the normal operating level.  There were passive mitigation systems used (drains and an enclosures) considered in the analysis since the vessel is located indoors.\n\nI\n\n In addition, Dean Foods has installed a sophisticated system of ammonia sensors that can remotely close certain isolation valves in the event of a small release and thereby limit an accidental release of ammonia. These sensors are capable of detecting releases of ammonia at low levels, and are connected to a computer that will shut certain valves to the system if ammonia is detected. In this way, potential releases of ammonia are minimized.\n\nA possible release scenario is one in which a vessel relief valve, vents due to system overpressurization, does not close, and continuously vents to the atmosphere for ten minutes.  The relief valve has a relief capacity of 54 pounds of vapor per minute. The relief valve is vented to the atmosphere. The initial high-pressure condition would have caused an alarm to be activated and response to this situation would occur within ten minutes. \nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less. Based on EPA's guidance, the alternative release scenario would result in a situation where public receptors would be within the distance to the toxic endpoint.\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is"

      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nDescription of Facility and Regulated Substance Handled:\nDean Foods Company/ Belvidere, Illinois processes Ice Cream Products. The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk, cream and ice cream within the facility. Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities. Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas liquefied under pressure. The refrigeration system consists of a Control-pressure receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves. \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies: Dean Foods Company/Belvidere, Illinois is committed to promoting safety for the plant, its employees and the surrounding area. The facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (RMP), Title 40 CFR Part 68. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely in order to prevent releases of ammonia from the system. In addition, these programs serve to develop procedures to minimize releases in the event that they do occur and to outline appropriate emergency response steps to take in the event of a release.\nWorst Case Release Scenario: EPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the worst case release scenario. The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur. The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\nThe worst case release scenario (as defined by EPA) is the release of"
