      "SummaryText": "National Welders conducts its operations to prevent possible releases or harm to its products, employees and to the surrounding area and residents.  The facility uses a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as the foundation of the chemical prevention program. The PHA systematically examines the equipment, systems and procedures for handling chlorine in order to identify the hazards that exist and how to control them. The PHA included a team review of the process using the ?what-if/checklist? methodology to identify hazards, review of previous incidents, verification of controls and the consequences of their failure, review of issues related to sitting and human factors and a qualitative evaluation of failures of control.\n\nThis facility conducts chlorine processing, consisting of receiving, storage and shipping already filled 150 pound cylinders of chlorine.  No chlorine cylinder filling, releasing, transferring, or servicing is part of the normal National Welders operations.  National Welders will have a maximum inventory of 4800 pounds of chlorine (32 - 150 lb cylinders).  \n\nNational Welders implements many Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the safe handling of chlorine and other compressed gas cylinders to prevent any accidental release.  Along with the written SOP?s, several administrative controls are used.  These include, operator training, emergency procedures, qualification of operators, and inventory control.  \n\nNational Welders in Greenville, South Carolina has not had a reportable chlorine accident to date.\n\nEmergency response training includes training of key response personnel in the use of emergency repair kits.  Hazardous material communication training is also conducted to protect the safety of all employees."
