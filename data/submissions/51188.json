If an accediental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, County Emergency Management, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and/or other authorities, to mitigate and mininize the impacts of the release to the public and the environment.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the distribution of products to farmers.  The fertilizer product, anhydrous ammonia, is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.  Anhdryous ammonia is stored in tanks designed for this purpose.\n\nThis facility fallows the provisions of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 20CFR1910.111, \"Storage and Handling of Anydrous Ammonia\" and our state regulations covering anhydrous ammonia.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia during the last five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, has there been any accidental releases resulting in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damange, or environmental damage.\n\nThe facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA 29CFR1910.38.  We do not plan to have our employees respond to a major relase.  If a large release of anhydrous ammonia takes place at our facility, the response action is to evacuate the area of the spill and call 911 and all applicable emergency response numbers listed in our Emergency Action Plan.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at this facility. Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the conditions of the facility.  There are no additional specific safety recommendations regarding the storage or theus of anhydrous ammonia for implementation at this time."
