(RRFF) committed to complying with all of the regulatory requirements of the EPA Risk Management Program. RRFF has developed their Risk Management Plan / Process Safety Management (RMP/PSM) Manual to document RRFF policies addressing the implementation of these regulations. The PSM sections pertain to the prevention of accidental releases and include the Process Hazard Analysis study and procedures for operating, training, maintenance, emergency response, and others. The RMP sections pertain to management systems and include the Hazard Assessment (Offsite Consequence Analysis) Report.\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE ACTIVITIES AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe RRFF El Centro facilities provides product cooling, processing, and short-term storage for fresh vegetables. \n \nThe facilities are located in an industrial area of El Centro on a contiguous property split by a city street.

The ammonia quantity in each of these systems is over 10,000 lbs each.\n\nIn addition to the Main Plant Systems, five (5) smaller systems (under 10,000 lbs each) are the property. Other than this paragraph, these systems are not addressed in the EPA RMP submission; however, they are addressed in the RMP as required by the California Accidental Release and Prevention Program (CalARP).\n\nThe refrigeration systems are direct, mechanical refrigeration systems (\u00c2\u00bfSystem\u00c2\u00bf). The original facilities were built prior to 1990 and have been expanded and modified since then. The ammonia equipment is located outside or in the Refrigerated Rooms. \n\nA portion of the ammonia equipment is portable and is moved on and off site annually. The local produce season typically runs November through April. The interconnecting piping between the portable components and the Main Plants are permanently mounted.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT\nThe regulation requires that the Worst-Case Release Scenario use the ammonia quantity in the largest vessel or pipe.\n\nNOTE: It is important to consider that the Worst-Case Scenario is extremely unlikely to occur since this scenario does not consider any safety features of the system  - in either design or operation.  The scenario parameters are established by the regulation to provide uniformity for dialog between the industry, community, and regulatory agencies.\n\nThe regulation allows the facility to select the Alternate-Case Scenario.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\nRRFF's Prevention Program is described in the RMP/PSM Manual. The RMP Prevention Program is equivalent to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM). The Prevention Program implemented by RRFF is essential to help prevent releases and to minimize the effects if a release does occur.\n\nKey objectives of RRFF's Prevention Program are briefly described below:\n\n1.Maintain current and complete refrigeration system technical information.

The evaluation considers a number of potential problems including: mechanical problems, human errors, and external events (e.g., earthquakes). All safety recommendations developed by the team are reviewed and addressed by RRFF. (Addressed under Process Hazard Analysis chapter.)\n3.Written procedures and policies that establish how the refrigeration system should be operated and maintained and how to investigate accidental releases. (Addressed under Operating Procedures, Mechanical Integrity, and Incident Investigation chapters.)\n4.Certification of refrigeration operators to safely operate the refrigeration system. RRFF certifies operators following completion of operator training and RRFF's confirmation of the operator's ability apply what they have learned. (Addressed under Training chapter.)\n5.Employee involvement in the Prevention Program. This is addressed on two levels. First, refrigeration equipment operators participate in the planning and evaluation of the Prevention Programs (e.g., Process Hazard Analysis study team, writing and/or reviewing operating procedures, Incident Investigation team, etc.). This involvement encourages ownership of the Prevention Program and positively affects the operators' day-to-day activities.  \nSecond, all RRFF employees (direct hires and contract) at this facility receive ammonia awareness training. Additionally, they have access to the RMP/PSM information. These activities improve the overall safety of the employees. (Both levels are addressed under Employee Participation chapter)\n6.Implementation of additional measures when changes are planned  (procedural or mechanical). These measures begin before any changes are made and may include a Process Hazard Analysis, operator training, and Process Safety Information updates plus other measures required by RRFF's Management of Change Procedure.  \nIf a mechanical change is required and for ma"

Additionally, if welding, grinding, or other Hot Work occurs inside the building and close to the refrigeration system, a RRFF Hot Work permit is required. The purpose of the permit and the associated Hot Work procedure is to minimize the possibility of a fire. \nFollowing completion of a mechanical change, a pre-startup safety review is required before the system can be started. (These areas are addressed under Management of Change, Contractor Qualifications, Hot Work Permit, and Pre-Start-up Safety Review chapters.)\n7.Verification of RRFF's compliance with the RMP/PSM program. This self-audit process is an important tool to confirm whether each of the elements in the Prevention Program  (and the Risk Management Program) has been implemented and properly documented by RRFF personnel. RRFF has established a Management System procedure to address any shortcomings, which the audit may find. (Addressed under Compliance Audit chapter.)   \n8.Minimize employee injury and illness. (Addressed under RRFF's Illness and Injury Prevention Program.)\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe RRFF facility  had one reportable accidental ammonia releases in the last five years.\n\n  \nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nRRFF's Emergency Response Program is described in their Emergency Response Plan for the El Centro facility.\n\nThis plan includes planned responses and procedures for evacuations, notifying responders and governmental agencies. The plan also includes first aid procedures for immediate care and instructions for follow-up medical care when necessary. The plan addresses training requirements for employees including production employees, supervisors, managers, and operators. Evacuation drills are an important part of the training. \n\nUnder RRFF's Emergency Response policy, RRFF employees who have been trained as First Responders may initially respond to releases that ca"
