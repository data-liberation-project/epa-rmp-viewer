Adherence to all EPA and OSHA regulations governing our operations.\n\n? Compliance with DOT requirements regarding shipping of materials.\n\n? Internal and 3rd party audits of Health, Safety and Environmental procedures at all Hawkins locations.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled:  \n\nThe Hawkins Minneapolis Facility is a chemical distribution warehouse that stores and distributes a number of materials used to protect public health by treating water, wastewater, swimming pools, agriculture and other uses.  The product regulated by OSHA Process Safety Management and EPA Risk Management Plan for this facility is anhydrous ammonia.   The facility also handles aqua ammonia >20% greater than the threshold regulated by EPA Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:  \n\nAccident prevention is achieved through handling procedures that properly protect chemicals during shipping and storage.  This starts with DOT approved containers that are robustly designed to contain the chemicals.  It continues through having employees trained in proper safety and handling procedures, and equipping them with equipment to safely handle chemicals.  Hawkins also adherence to OSHA workplace rules as part of our safety program.  We follow industry standards, such as those of the National Chemical Distribution Association, to ensure that our equipment and procedures are protective of the health and safety of our employees, the environment, and the surrounding community.\n\n\n\n5-Year Accident History:  \n\nAs a result of our diligence, there has not been an accidental release from a covered process that resulted in deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at this facility in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response:  \n\nIn the event of an anhydrous ammonia rel"

Evacuate to a safe distance. \n\n \n\nIn the event of an aqua ammonia release, the facility personnel are trained to handle small to medium sized aqua ammonia releases on site and to call the fire department for hazmat assistance for larger aqua ammonia releases.  The facility is equipped with a scrubber system and containment basin in the event of an aqua ammonia release during tote filling.\n\n\n\nThe local fire department has toured the facility and is aware of the chemicals on site.  In order to help assist the local fire department, Hawkins has a special recovery vessel on site in which a leaking anhydrous ammonia 150 pound or smaller cylinder can be inserted to contain any further release.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes:  \n\nWhile Hawkins desires to continually improve safety, there are no specific changes planned other than to continue compliance with industry standards and government regulations and our own commitment to \"Think Safe! Be Safe!\".\n\n"
