The facility has two anhydrous ammonia tanks and four urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) liquid fertilizer storage tanks.  In addition there are two dry warehouses and a dry barge unloading facility.\n. \nB.  Accidental Release Record:\n\nThe terminal, has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to facility personnel since it was constructed in 1964. \n \nThe facility safety record is the direct result of continued emphasis on safety by management, employees, contractors, and truck drivers.  There have not been any releases from the terminal that meet the description of an RMP accidental release. \n\nC. General Accidental Release Prevention  Policies And Activities:\n\n\n\nThe entire Nitrogen team works together to ensure the facility is in compliance with OSHA?s Process Safety Management standards and the accident prevention programs are continuously improved.  A networked computer management system is utilized to provide our employees with the necessary tools and records to maintain the safety of the process.  This teamwork is an integral part in the safety efforts of this facility.\n\nAccident release prevention steps include the fourteen-element program for Process Safety Management, a management system, corporate oversight of the facility, and a focus on continuous improvement. \n\nAll employees are encouraged to participate in the facility?s safety program.  Examples of employee participation include participation in Process Hazard Analyses, cooperative training, updating of operating procedures, and emergency response activities. \n\n\nThe facility has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps, compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  This program includes:\n\n1. training\n2. written operating procedures\n3. inspectio"

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner, conforms to generally accepted standards, and provides a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits\n\nThe facility has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented. \n\n\nF.  Five Year Accident History:\n\nThe Terminal has an excellent safety record with no deaths or serious injuries to any of its personnel.  In addition, the terminal has operated without a lost time accident for over thirteen years. \n\nThere have not been any incidents that meet the definition of a RMP recordable release. \n\nG.  Emergency Response:\n\nThe facility Emergency Action Plan covers accidental releases of plant chemicals, natural disasters, emergency response practices and procedures, and process safety topics.  The plan is reviewed at least annually with all employees.\n\nAll permanent employees have the required Hazmat training, including an eight-hour refresher course annually. Each employee and permanent contractor is trained on the facility?s Emergency Response policies and procedures at regularly scheduled plant safety meetings.\n\nThe terminal manager and his assistant attend monthly Community Advisory Panel meetings.
