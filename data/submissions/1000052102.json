The facility crushes grapes in order to produce wine, distilled spirits, and juice for concentrate.  These products are stored prior to shipment to other Gallo facilities for further processing and distribution.\r\n\r\n\tThe facility operates anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to provide product cooling.  Refrigeration systems have storage vessels (receivers) sized to contain all the liquid ammonia in the system, with additional capacity for thermal expansion.\r\n\r\n\tThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop heat transfer system.  Ammonia moves through the system due to pressure differences produced by the compressors.  A brief description of the ammonia refrigeration cycle follows:\r\n\r\nRefrigeration cycle follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe receiver vessel stores liquid ammonia under pressure.  High pressure liquid ammonia flows from the receiver through liquid lines to the expansion valve, which partitions the pressure and temperature.  Liquid ammonia at reduced pressure and temperature is then piped in to the chiller shell.  \r\n2.\tProduct is circulated through sealed stainless steel tubing within the chiller shell.  Heat from the warm product transfers through the tubing walls to the cooler refrigerant, causing liquid refrigerant to boil off as low pressure vapor.  The rate of vaporization, and thereby the cooling of product, is determined by the amount of pressure in the chiller as controlled by a back pressure regulator, and suction from the compressors.  \r\n3.\tThe compressors draw the low pressure vapor from the chiller, compress it into high pressure vapor, and discharge it to the evaporative condenser (cooling tower).\r\n4.\tIn the evaporative condenser, ammonia vapor flows through tubing which is sprayed with water and located within fan driven air flow to promote"

On October 3, 2014 an employee was transporting a cylinder of SO2 when the braided hose got caught on a nearby hose rack, resulting in an estimated release of less than 111 lb.  State OES and Fresno County CUPA were notified.  An on-site refrigeration mechanic was able to contain the release by shutting the main valve.\r\n\tOn August 31, 2014 and employee was adding SO2 to a product tank when the mechanical seal on the pump failed, releasing juice and SO2, resulting in a loss of about 15 lb.  When the employee noticed the juice coming from the seal, the system was shut down, also stopping the release of SO2.\r\n\r\nAmmonia\r\n\r\nIn the five years prior to this submission, there have been no accidents or releases of ammonia at E & J Gallo Winery, Fresno that exceed the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds in the past five years (August 2010 - August 2015).

The leak was stopped at 3:06 am lasting a total of 71 minutes and releasing approximately 5 pounds of ammonia.\r\nOn August 10, 2012, there was a vapor release from a relief valve on Chiller 55.  The system had been under a vacuum while recent work was occurring on the system.  The chiller was being water tested, but the suction valve was still closed.  This resulted in vapor being released from the Pressure Relief Valve.  The system was shut down within approximately 5 minutes, resulting in a loss of about 10 lb.\r\nOn October 9, 2014, there was a vapor release from an ammonia hotwell.  The system had leaked product, lowering the pH of the hotwell which called for dosing from the ammonia system.  The automatic valve failed open, causing the hotwell to saturate and began to gas off.  When the leak was detected by a security guard going by, a refrigeration mechanic shut the hand valve on the system, then replaced the automatic valve.  The release lasted for about 15 minutes, resulting in a loss of about 5 lb.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nTOXIC WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO:\r\n\r\n\t\tThe worst case release scenario was determined in accordance with requirements of the California Accidental Release Prevention Program.

If damage was sufficient to cause a failure, it could occur at a flange due to bolt failure, and result in a 1 inch square opening.  The release of liquid ammonia from the opening could be expelled into the air and onto the surrounding surfaces.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION\r\n\r\n\t\tThe E & J Gallo Winery employs RETA-trained/certified refrigeration mechanics, supported by engineering staff.  The refrigeration system is maintained through the scheduled implementation of a scheduled preventative maintenance program based upon standard industry practices. Employees required to operate ammonia refrigeration equipment receive training specific to their assigned duties and all operators hold the appropriate RETA certifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE\r\n\r\n\t\tIn the event of a reportable chemical release, notifications will be made to the appropriate agencies including the Fresno County Department of Health Services, the State Office of Emergency Services (as directed by the Fresno County CUPA), and the Federal National Response Center (as appropriate). \r\n\r\n\t\tGallo management and site representatives will respond to the emergency within their level of training and will partner with public emergency response personnel in mitigating the problem.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CHANGE\r\n\r\n\t\tThe Management of Change Procedure will require evaluation of new construction and modifications to existing ammonia systems to determine the likelihood of an effect on ammonia safety.
