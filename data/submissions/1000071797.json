      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe ExxonMobil Baytown Olefins Plant (BOP) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety and protecting the environment. This commitment is demonstrated by continued participation in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), as well as through the resources invested in accident prevention as outlined below.  BOP has been awarded the coveted \"STAR\" recognition by OSHA for excellence in occupational safety and health.  \n\n\n\nExxonMobil Corporation enhanced its safety programs in 1991 by implementing structured safety management systems entitled Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  In 1997, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance reviewed OIMS and evaluated it against the international standard for Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001) to determine if OIMS is equivalent to ISO 14001.  After an extensive review which included a number of facility audits, they concluded that the \"environmental components of OIMS are consistent with the intent and meet the requirements of the ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems Standard.\"  They went on to say, \"We further believe Exxon[Mobil] to be among the industry leaders in the extent to which environmental management considerations have been integrated into its ongoing business processes.\"\n\n\n\nWith the 2018 submission, BOP has reviewed and updated the Risk Management Plan as required under 40 CFR 68.190(b)(5) within 6 months of a change that required a revised PHA or hazard review. \n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY POLICIES\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the general accident prevention program in place at BOP.  EPA's Program 3 prevention requirements have been implemented for the entire plant.  This is the same approach taken with the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. \n\n\n\nIn addition, ExxonMobil has implemented its Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS).  OIMS includes aspects of EPA's prevention prog"

As already mentioned, OIMS has been attested as equivalent to ISO 14001 as a valid management system to oversee the implementation of the risk management activities.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation \n\nBOP encourages employees to participate in process safety management and accident prevention, key thrusts of the OSHA VPP program.  Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling operating and maintenance procedures to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to information created as part of the accident prevention program.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information \n\nBOP keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis \n\nBOP has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that controls are in place to manage these hazards.  New projects that add facilities are analyzed as part of the design process to ensure that the controls necessary to adequately manage the hazards associated with the facilities are installed as part of the project.  \n\n\n\nBOP primarily uses the Knowledge Based Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study that is an adaptation by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering and ExxonMobil Chemical Americas of widely used industry methodologies to perform these evaluations.  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating experience and engineering expertise on the process to be evaluated.  This PHA team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident "

Mitigation options are identified and evaluated. Selected mitigation options are tracked until they are complete.  The resolution and completion of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures \n\nBOP maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) startup, (2) shutdown, (3), normal and (4) emergency operations.  These procedures can be used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a consistent basis for training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and amended as necessary. \n\n\n\nBOP has identified operating limits (i.e., documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters such as temperature, level, and compositions.) This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the process unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nBOP has implemented a comprehensive training program.  New employees receive basic training in chemical plant operations.  Operations and mechanical personnel periodically receive refresher training to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained.  \n\n\n\nContractors \n\nBOP has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.

The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity \n\nBOP has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: (1) training, (2) written procedures, (3) inspections and tests, (4) correcting identified deficiencies, and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices \n\nBOP has long-standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  These include control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, energy isolation for equipment being worked on, procedures for the safe removal of hazardous materials before opening of process piping/equipment, hot work permit/procedure, vehicle entry into process area, confined space entry permit/procedure, and job safety analyses.  \n\n\n\nManagement of Change \n\nBOP has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology, process operating conditions, procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation \n\nBOP investigates incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.

Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation team's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete.  \n\n\n\nCompliance Audits  \n\nTo help ensure that the OSHA PSM program is functioning properly and that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations, BOP periodically conducts an audit.  The results of the audit are used to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the program and regulations are being implemented.  Compliance audits are typically conducted at least every 3 years by ExxonMobil personnel from other sites who are considered experts in the safety and environmental fields.\n\n\n\nFACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\n \n\nBOP is located in Baytown, Harris County, Texas.  It operates to produce a variety of chemical intermediate feedstocks such as ethylene, propylene, and butadiene.  The plant has regulated flammables such as propylene, ethylene, propane, and butenes.  In addition, the plant uses chlorine and ammonia.
