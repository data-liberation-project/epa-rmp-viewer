      "SummaryText": "This document was developed for the City of Brooklyn Park Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in an effort to fulfill criteria of the Risk Management Program (RMP), as required by Section 112 (r) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), and regulated by 40 CFR, Part 68.  The Brooklyn Park WTP is a conventional water treatment plant utilizing filtration, sedimentation, and disinfection.  The quantity of chlorine used at the WTP is greater than 2,500 pounds, which is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) threshold quantity requiring the development and submittal of the information found in this RMP document.  A hazard assessment was conducted for the chlorine process and consideration was also given to the other hazardous chemicals at the WTP.\n\n\n\nIt is the City's intent to uphold industry standards in the operation of the WTP and it is their policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  If an emergency was to occur, the Brooklyn Park Fire Department will be notified (via the 911 system) for response to the emergency.\n\n\n\nChlorine is considered toxic by EPA standards.  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a water treatment disinfecting agent, also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these chemicals to prevent unnecessary human exposure, and to reduce the potential impact or threat to nearby members of the community.  Safety depends upon the manner in which chemicals are handled, safety devices in place at the Brooklyn Park WTP, and training of Brooklyn Park WTP personnel.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine system at the WTP consists of one (1) ton cyclinders, scales, chlorinators, vacuum regulators, diffusers, injectors, residual analyzers, leak detectors, and a chlorine emergency vapor scrubber system.  The chlorine cyclinders, scales and vacuum regulators are located in Room 135. Room 134 houses the chlorinators and the chlorine neutralization system is located in Room 211. Chlorine is also stored and used at the well houses, for water "

      "SummaryText": "treatment, in 150 pound cylinders.\n\n\n\nThe chlorine storage room has four (4) weigh scales, as well as storage capacity for four (4) additional one (1) ton cylinders.  A single, one (1) ton chlorine cylinder can be placed on each of the scales for connection to the system.  Generally the facility has two (2) cylinders in operation and two (2) cylinders in waiting, but the room has been known to have eight (8) full or partially full cylinders at a time.  The WTP chlorine storage rooom and the chlorinator room are equipped with chlorine detectors.  These rooms are also connected to a sodium hydroxide emergency chlorine scrubber system.  The distribution/piping system is constructed of schedule 80 PVC piping and is operated under negative pressure (vacuum).\n\n\n\nIt is the City's intent to comply with the EPA accidental release prevention rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Brooklyn Park takes a systematic, proactive approach to evaluating chemical processes.  Using this approach, the design, technology, operation and maintenance activities, emergency preparedness plans, training, process changes, and other elements that affect processes are all considered.  Through evaluation, the consequences of catastrophic releases can be prevented or minimized.  \n\n\n\nBy fulfilling the required elements of the Process Safety Management (PSM, required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and RMP standards, the City of Brooklyn Park intends to prevent unwanted releases and/or minimize the impacts of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals, especially into locations that could expose serious hazards to employees, the community and the environment.  Our management systems address each of the key features of a successful release prevention program including:\n\n\n\n*Process Safety Information\n\n*Process Hazard Analysis\n\n*Operating Procedures\n\n*Training\n\n*Mechanical Integrity\n\n*Management of Change\n\n*Pre-Startup Review\n\n*Compliance Audits\n\n*Incident Inves"

The City has developed a management system that identifies job positions and division of responsibilities to ensure proper management of the RMP.\n\n\n\nThere have been no releases of chlorine or other toxic/extremely hazardouse chemicals in the past five (5) years.  The content and intent of the emergency response program completed under this RMP effort has been discussed with the Brooklyn Park Fire Department.  The City will rely on the Fire Department's response capability and trained staff, should an accidental release occur."
