This operation continues to supply aqueous ammonia to the end user for agricultural fertilization.  Aqueous ammonia is loaded at the facility and delivered to the field for application.  All personal information, addresses, and telephone numbers were rechecked for applicability.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable spills or releases in the last five years, and no injuries or illnesses that were caused by ammonia products.\n\nEmergency Response and Accident Prevention Program\n\nThe facility continues to be committed to following all applicable safety and reporting regulations for the storage and transport of ammonia products.  There is an emergency plan in place covering response to releases, and it is presented in annual emergency response training for all involved personnel.  \n\nWorst and Alternate Case Scenarios\n\nBoth scenarios were evaluated and remodeled using RMP comp.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nWilbur-Ellis is committed to continuously making safety improvements. To improve the safety of the\n\nammonia system and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis is in the process of implementing a comprehensive safety process to help guide facility employees to safe operations on all aspects of the job.  The safety process is designed to be implemented in steps, step one being the fundamentals and foundational elements of an en-grained safety culture and program. \n\nThe process takes a risked based approach to safety and provides guides for each safety program that provides the elements required to implement that program effectively and the methods on how to execute those elements.  Wilbur-Ellis is committed to putting safety first and creating a culture where behavior based safety can thrive.   Our safety program includes measures for tracking progress and success, and addressing opportunities for improvement within the process a"
