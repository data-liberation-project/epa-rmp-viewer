Natural gas and steam are used in the manufacturing process to produce hydrogen. The flammable mixture containing Hydrogen and Methane is used to produce hydrogen, in the amounts handled by our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Air Products manages the safety of the regulated processes by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices (e.g., alarms, shutdowns, instrumentation, relief devices) inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental release of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of our personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nOur emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER Standards (First Responder Awareness level).  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Materials unit. \n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substances and processes considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\nOne of the principal purposes of this facility is to manufacture gaseous hydrogen.  This facility manufactures liquid and gaseous hydrogen. Hydrogen is used by our customers in their manufacturing processes. Natural gas is received by our plant via pipeline and used as our feedstock. The feedstock is mixed with steam and sent to the reformer furnace. In the reformer furnace, the feedstock and steam are heated in the presence of a catalyst to approximately 1,500 degrees F, where a chemical"

The pure hydrogen is then compressed and delivered to our customers via pipeline or sent to a liquefier where the gas is cooled and stored as a liquid for delivery to our customers via tank truck. \n\n\n\nThe facility complies with the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan, and OSHA'ss Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  The design  and construction of the facility complies with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facility's emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER standard.  At this site, employees are trained to recognize emergencies and initiate emergency response from the LEPC and outside agencies.  The employees receive annual refresher training in their role in the emergency plan.  Emergency response activities have also been coordinated with the  New Orleans Fire Department and other appropriate local responders so that appropriate measures can be taken to control accidental releases.  Periodic drills are conducted to review the effectiveness of our emergency procedures."
