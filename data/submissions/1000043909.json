Both a worst case scenario and an alternative case scenario were developed.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is designed and constructed in accordance with ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems.  To prevent and mitigate accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia, Hillshire Brands Company - Newbern, TN has implemented several precautionary measures.\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands Company - Newbern, TN has developed and implemented a PSM program pursuant to OSHA regulations and as such, has evaluated the system for potential anhydrous ammonia releases.  Some of the controls installed to prevent catastrophic releases of ammonia are process equipment (vents, pressure relief valves, backup pumps, and manual shutoffs) and automated controls (automatic shut-off), ammonia leak detection system, and electrical distribution system grounding.  In addition, Hillshire Brands Company - Newbern, TN has trained personnel to respond to potential ammonia releases (Emergency Response/Hazardous Materials team).\n\n\n\nHillshire Brands Company - Newbern, TN has developed standard operating procedures for all employees and contractors that have contact with the ammonia refrigeration system that incorporate safety measures into the procedures.  These safety procedures were developed by refrigeration system operators and are reviewed at a frequency sufficient to assure that they reflect current operating practice, including changes that res"
