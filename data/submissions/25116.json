The owners, managers and employees of Sweetland Ag Tech LLC., Muscatine, Ia are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire dept., LEPC, or other authorities, to migrate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.  Our company policy would be to shutoff any emergency valves that is possible for us to get to.  Evacuate anypersons in the way of harm.\n\nII.  Facility info\n   A.

Anhydrous Ammonia is received, and distributed for application on crops as fertilizer nutrients.\n\nIII.  Worst case release scenario and the alternative release scenario.\n   A.  The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a ten minute period.  The maximum quantity release would be 79,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the toxic endpoints is 1.06 miles.\n\n    B.  The alternative release scenario is based on release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.59 miles.  To keep mitigation to a minimum we would shutoff all emergency valves as possible, call fire dept., and keep area evacuated.\n\nIV.  The accidental release prevention program.\n    A.  The facility has implanted the provisions of the safety requirments for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia, K-61, published by the American Standards Institute Inc.\n\n    B.  The facility has implanted the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.
