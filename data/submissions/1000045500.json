Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nZacky Farms, LLC is strongly committed to the safety of our employees, the public and the\nenvironment. This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention\nprogram that addresses the design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee\ntraining associated with the covered processes at our facility.\n\nIt is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated\nsubstances. If such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand to\ncontrol and mitigate the effects of the release. We are also coordinated with the Region 5 LEPC\nInland South and the Fresno Fire Department, which provide additional emergency response\nexpertise. \n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nZacky's primary activity in Fresno is poultry processing. At our Empire West facility, located at\n2950 E. California Ave. in Fresno, CA, we store and ship both frozen and fresh poultry products.\nAmmonia is our only RMP regulated substance and is used to provide refrigeration for the cold\nstorage of our poultry products. The maximum inventory of ammonia at this facility is 15,000\npounds.\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention\nSteps:\n\nOur facility has taken all of the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention\nrequirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The ammonia refrigeration system is also\nsubject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119 and to EPCRA Section 302\nnotification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release\nprevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nZacky Farms maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical\nhazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associate"
