Changes in the pressure are directly related to changes in temperature (i.e., lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature). Low pressure liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained with the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia and discharged to the atmosphere as it is condensed back into liquid. \r\n \r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\n\r\nPrevention of accidental ammonia releases at Sara Lee is accomplished through sound industry practice in the original ammonia refrigeration system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.\r\n \r\n-This includes:\r\nAA\u00bf\tCompliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification;\r\nAA\u00bf\tPerformance of a thorough Process Hazard Analyses (PHAs) at least once every five years using accurate Process Safety Information; \r\nAA\u00bf\tImplementation of Operating Procedures.\r\nAA\u00bf\tAppropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel;  \r\nAA\u00bf\tPerformance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout/tagout and hot work permit programs;\r\nAA\u00bf\tApplication of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols; and\r\nAA\u00bf\tUse of qualified contractors for work on the system.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThere have been no ammonia releases within the last 5 years resulting in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or in off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in p"

An Environment & Safety Administrator has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. This site has developed and trained personnel to assist the Alameda County Fire Department to ensure rapid and appropriate response to ammonia emergencies. The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Sara Lee employees, the public, and the environment in the event of an ammonia release. \r\n\r\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\n\r\nThe Sara Lee plant covered by this RMP is located at 2411 Baumann Ave in San Lorenzo, California. The facility is divided into two areas: Raw and Ready to Eat. The Raw portion of the plant receives, processes, and prepares meats for cooking or curing. The Ready to Eat portion of the plant packages the prepared products.\r\nProducts from this plant include Gallo Salame&reg; Italian Dry Salame and Pepperoni; Galileo&reg; Italian Dry Salame, Pepperoni; Deli d'Italia&reg; Italian Dry Salame, Genoa, Hillshire Farm&reg; Hard Salami and La Italia&reg; Italian Dry Salame, Pepperoni. \r\n-A stationary anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system is used for room cooling and process chilling. The potential total anhydrous ammonia charge to the system is 15,000 pounds. This ammonia refrigeration system is the only process at this site to which the RMP requirements are applicable.\r\nThe site includes a large processing building with administration offices; the refrigeration engine room; the shipping and receiving areas; and employee and visitor parking lots.

The plan is maintained at the site's Safety Office. The document describes outside agency notification procedures in the event of an ammonia release, provides detailed evacuation proceduresfor the control of ammonia releases. The control procedures include leak investigation, release isolation, shutting off equipment, closing valves, and other control actions that do not involve plant personnel entering an IDLH environment. \r\n-The Alameda County Fire Department will be used to respond to any catastrophic leaks. The plant has a trained Emergency Action Team (EAT) that is capable of providing basic first aid and non-confined space personnel rescues and escape in non-hazardous environments. The EAT is capable of providing technical support to the fire department in the event of a catastrophic ammonia leak.  In the event of a catastrophic leak, Sara Lee will evacuate and take initial life safety precautions.\r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe facility continues to update the RMP by conducting three-year audits and five-year Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) Revalidations.  The last three-year audit was in 2009 and the last PHA revalidation was in 2008.  The next three-year audit is scheduled for 2011 and the next PHA revalidation is scheduled for 2013.  In addition to a committed audit program, the facility also continuously strives to improve both its mechanical integrity program and employee training.  \r\n-The facility has implemented Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), which will improve mechanical integrity by updating maintenance procedures and incorporating the latest in maintenance techniques and methodologies.  The facility is also developing a comprehensive Predictive Maintenance (PdM) Program that will utilize technologies such as thermography and vibra"
