As part of the community involvement efforts, the facility's management participates in the local CAER group efforts. \r\n\r\nAs part of preparing the RMP, the facility's five year accident history was reviewed.

Planned changes and policies to promote this improvement include the continuous review and update of the plant safety program and annual emergency drills to determine and improve upon deficiencies.  Efforts to update and implement additional safe work practices and policies are ongoing and include areas such as:\r\n\r\n     Hazard Communication\r\n     Confined Space Entry\r\n     Line Breaking Procedures\r\n     Lock out Tag out\r\n\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThe facility has no reportable accidents in the past five years."
