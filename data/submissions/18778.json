This includes a 3 year review of the contractor's Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), review of OSHA recordable injuries and illnesses and corrective actions, review of Lost Work Day Cases Away (LWDCA) and corrective actions, review of the contractor's safety program including safety policies, training, and medical monitoring, and review of any applicable site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) prepared by the contractor.  The information supplied by the contractor is retained on site while the contractor is engaged in work activities.\n\nPrior to commencing work on site, each contractor employee receives a safety orientation provided by AlliedSignal.  The safety orientation covers information on the hazards associated with the process areas where the work will be performed, safety procedures and systems to be used, overview of the site emergency response program including specific procedures to be followed in case of emergency, and a review of site safety rules and applicable operating procedures.  A record of each contractor employee's sign-off on the safety orientation is maintained on file at the site, including the date the training was completed.  Once the safety orientation is complete, the contractor is responsible to ensure that each contractor employee performs the assigned work in a manner consistent with the information provided during the safety orientation.  If the contractor assigns new employees to the job after work has commenced, the contractor must also ensure that each new employee receives a safety orientation prior to starting work on site.

The plant has approximately 163 employees and operates 24 hours per day. The one chemical at the Farmers Valley plant that is subject to the RMP regulation is anhydrous ammonia. \nAnhydrous ammonia is a colorless gas with a strong pungent odor. At the Farmers Valley plant ammonia is used as a refrigerant to cool the charge stock to the Deoiling Unit. The normal maximum inventory of ammonia at the plant is 19,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3. Worst case scenarios and alternative release scenarios\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program requires the Farmers Valley plant to prepare an analysis of a hypothetical worst case release of the chemical covered by the RMP regulation. EPA defines a worst case release as the release of the largest quantity of the chemical from a vessel or process line failure. EPA also assumes that the failure takes place over 10 minutes and that all safety systems fail to operate. In addition, the release must take place during the worst possible weather conditions. For a number of reasons discussed in this submittal, it is extremely unlikely that this event would ever occur.\nThe Farmers Valley plant is also required to analyze the impact of an alternative accidental release scenario.\nAt the AlliedSignal Farmers Valley Plant the one chemical which is currently subject to the RMP rule is ammonia. Ammonia is classified as a toxic under the RMP rule.  \n a) Worst Case Scenarios\nThe worst case scenario for ammonia involves the failure of an ammonia storage tank containing 6,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, assuming the vessel is filled to its capacity. The anhydrous ammonia is released as a gas to the atmosphere. The plant is located in a lightly populated area and the cloud"

      "SummaryText": "formed by the escaping ammonia would reach offsite endpoints and nearby public receptors. \n\nb) Alternative Release Scenario\nThe alternative release scenario considered for anhydrous ammonia would involve the failure of a transfer hose being used to offload a tank truck of ammonia. The excess flow valve on the truck would automatically close and limit the amount of ammonia released. This release of ammonia would have an offsite impact.\n\n4. General accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program at the AlliedSignal Farmers Valley plant consists of 12 elements.  Each of these elements is described below.\n \n4a. Process Safety Information\n\nWritten process safety information is compiled before conducting process hazard analyses for processes using ammonia.  This enables the employees involved in operating these processes to identify and understand the potential hazards associated with the processes.  The information compiled includes data on the safe use and handling of ammonia (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets), data on the process technology (e.g., Process Flow Diagrams, process chemistry, flow rates and storage capacities, operating limits and evaluation of exceedances), and data on the equipment used in the process (e.g., Piping & Instrument Diagrams, materials compatibility, energy ratings and classification, control devices and emergency systems, ventilation systems, design basis including conformance to applicable codes and standards).  The process safety information is adequate to show compliance of the process design with generally accepted good engineering practices.\n\n4b. Process Hazard Analyses\n\nProcess hazard analyses for the processes involving ammonia have been completed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) (OSHA Process Safety Management).  These process hazard analyses are updated and revalidated in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.119(e), and are retained on site for the life of"

Each process hazard analysis addresses the process hazards, process incident history, process control devices and detection systems, evaluation of failure of process control devices, equipment location, and human factors.  Each process hazard analysis is performed by a team of employees having experience and knowledge of the process design and operation, and knowledge of how to complete a process hazard analysis.  The Management of Change process (described below) is used to track and document process changes, which occur as a result of recommendations from process hazard analyses.\n\n4c. Operating Procedures\n\nWritten operating procedures are prepared for each of the processes involving ammonia. The operating procedures provide clear instructions for safely conducting activities in the plant.  The procedures are updated to reflect current operating practices, and are certified annually for accuracy.\n\nSpecific information and instructions covered by the operating procedures include startup, normal operation, emergency operation, shutdown, operating limits, operating controls, chemical-specific health and safety information, required personal protective equipment, and use of safety systems.  Written procedures are also provided for specific operations such as lockout/tagout, confined space entry and line breaking.\n\n4d.
