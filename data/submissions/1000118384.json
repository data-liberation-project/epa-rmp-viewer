Accidental Release Prevention Policies\n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa has developed a risk management program and an emergency response plan to address the requirements of 40 CFR 68 of the Clean Air Act. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa is diligent in the handling of all chemicals and is dedicated to the safety of its employees and the neighboring community. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa staff is trained and utilize equipment to monitor the facility and provide safeguards, while effectively and safely storing and distributing aqueous ammonia. \n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Aqueous Ammonia Storage System. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \n\n2. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa is located at 7254 Farinon Rd., Colusa, California in the county of Colusa. The primary activity at the facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAqua ammonia (24% of ammonia by weight) is stored in one 98,572-gallon above ground tank at the site. Additional information regarding inventory is reported in this submittal and in the Hazard Assessment report. \n\n3. Hazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\n\nPer 40 CFR 68 Regulations, the description covering the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios has been eliminated from the executive summary. Please refer to the Hazard Assessment report for the results of this analysis. \n\n-Risk Considerations\n\nAmmonia is a toxic inhalation hazard; and thus, the use of aqueous ammonia has inherent potential risks to potentially reach sensitive populations within"

The facility's identified potential risks for an ammonia release from its process are included in the off-site consequence analysis and Process Hazard Analysis (PHA). Facility RMP elements and other safety programs are structured to minimize the potential of a release from the identified risks.\n\n   -The history of the Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa (i.e., no reportable ammonia releases) reflects the adequacy of the design and diligence of the plant staff in safely storing and distributing aqueous ammonia. \n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program \n\nAs part of the implementation of this Risk Management Program, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa to manage process safety issues associated with the use of aqueous ammonia. In addition, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed.\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThere have been no EPA-applicable releases of ammonia at Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa in the past five years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Program\n\nWilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa is not a First Responder.  Employees are trained to evacuate and call 911 in case of an emergency.  Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa will coordinate with local Fire Department and First Responders. Wilbur-Ellis Company, Colusa has filed a Business Emergency Plan to help coordinate with local responders. An Emergency Action Plan (EAP) that meets applicable requirements is in place.\n\n7. External Events Analysis Information\n\nPursuant to the requirements of applicable regulations, the following external events analysis information shall be submitted:  \n-The types of natural and human caused external events required.  \n-The estimated magnitude or scope of external events which were considered. If seismic events are applicable, the parameters used in the consideration of the seismic analysis and which edition of the Uniform Building Code was used when the p"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nTo improve the safety of ammonia and all other aspects of operations, Wilbur-Ellis has implemented a comprehensive, risk-based safety management process to help guide employees to improved safety performance. The safety management process, branded Guiding People to Safety (GPS), is designed to be implemented in four steps, step one comprising of the foundation and fundamental elements of a strong safety program and positive safety culture. The GPS process provides guidelines for each safety program that describes methods for effective implementation. The GPS program includes measures for tracking progress and success and for addressing opportunities for improvement within the process and individual safety programs. These measures include action tracking software to facilitate timely corrections of deficiencies and recommended improvements identified during inspections, audits, and hazard analyses. Wilbur-Ellis is committed to preventing incidents cultivating a positive safety culture throughout the company. The mission of our Environmental Health, Safety, and Security (EHSS) team is to drive effective results in reducing incidents and employee injuries by combing the GPS process with a positive safety culture."
