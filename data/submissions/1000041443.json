If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Company, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and transfer of fertilizer for use by farmers.\r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 113,594 pounds in our storage tank.  In addition to this we have 52,428 pounds of capacity in rolling stock (12 tanks of 1000 gallon water capacity figured at 85%, which is the maximum filled capacity with NH3).  This leaves us a total of 166,022 pounds total capacity.  The largest amount handled at one time would be a semi load of NH3 at an estimated 41,000 pounds\r\n\r\nThe worst-case release and alternate scenario have been removed at the request of the EPA.  This is due to security concerns and falls under the homeland security act.  \r\n\r\nWe believe that our company's safety culture and the training our employees have been through have helped us achieve an outstanding safety record. \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant proper damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\r\n\r\nThe facility has a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA and we report are regulated materials to the Community Right to Know program, the local fire department and the County LEPC.  Local emergency responders are encouraged to tour our facilities at their convenience.   \r\n\r\nOur employees routinely inspect the facilities for any necessary repairs or updates.  \r\n\r\nThere are no necessary repairs or improvements needed at this time.
