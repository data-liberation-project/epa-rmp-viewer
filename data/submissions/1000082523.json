The program consists of engineering controls, written policies, process safety information documents, operation and maintenance manuals, and other supporting documentation.  This program is consistent with the facility's general commitment to public safety and complies in full with EPA's Chemical Accident Provisions at 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies \n\n\n\nPrior to commencement of operations in 2002, Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. established a set of formal, written policies to meet the requirements of EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions regulations, (often referred to as \"RMP regulations\" by Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. employees).  These policies also meet the requirements of similar Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations set forth by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at 29 CFR 1910.119. \n\n\n\nThe Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We implement safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to minimize the risks presented by hazardous materials used at our facilities.

For each program element, there is a statement of facility policy, references to locations of documentation showing compliance with the policy, and references to the specific regulations that apply to the policy.\n\n\n\nThe facility maintains the integrated RMP/PSM Policies and supporting documentation in a set of clearly labeled document binders.  The binders are on-file in the facility's document control room, where they are accessible to all employees at the site.  \n\n\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances Handled   \n\n\n\nOntelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. is a combined-cycle electric generation plant that uses gas-fired combustion turbines to make electric power.  The facility produces enough electricity to meet the needs of more than 500,000 homes throughout the region.  \n\n\n\nNitrogen oxides are a by-product of the turbines' combustion process.  Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC.'s air permit imposes restrictions on the amount of nitrogen oxide that the plant can emit into the air.  The facility uses an Anhydrous Ammonia System to control these emissions.  The system works as follows. \n\n\n\nSpecialized tanker trucks bring anhydrous ammonia onsite, where it is transferred to two 1,600 cubic foot (12,000 gallon)  tanks and stored as a pressurized liquid.  Ammonia vapor is drawn from the tanks through a sealed system and into a selective catalytic reduction system, where it is injected into the exhaust stream of the facility's combustion turbines.  There, nitrogen oxides in the exhaust react with the ammonia to create harmless nitrogen and water.  The quantity in the tank is administratively controlled to an 85% maximum fill volume.\n\n\n\nCollectively, the ammonia storage system and the selective catalytic red"

The Anhydrous Ammonia System enables the facility to meet EPA's Lowest Achievable Emission Rate for nitrogen oxides.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\n\n\nOntelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. has a comprehensive accidental release prevention program for the Anhydrous Ammonia System.  The Anhydrous Ammonia System has a number of engineering controls to prevent accidental releases.  Multiple, redundant monitors of system temperature, pressure, and flow will automatically notify the control operators before a problem occurs.  Fail-safe interlocks can shut the system down without human intervention.  Multiple ammonia detectors can quickly detect a release and automatically trigger a water deluge system to knock down ammonia vapors.  The facility has been designed for safety, and uses best industry practices for the safe unloading, storage and use of ammonia.   \n\n\n\nIn addition to engineering controls, the program includes a wide array of administrative controls to ensure that the Anhydrous Ammonia System is properly operated and maintained.  As noted above, the administrative controls include written RMP/PSM policies.  The administrative controls also include a detailed analysis of process hazards, written operating procedures, employee training, contractor training, contractor evaluation procedures, management-of-change procedures, regular mechanical integrity inspections and compliance audits.  \n\n\n\nPreventive and corrective maintenance activities on the Anhydrous Ammonia System are planned, scheduled, assigned and documented using a computerized maintenance management information system known as Maximo.  This work management tool provides documented evidence that the requirements of the management of change and mechanical integrity programs are implemented in full.

To the extent that inspections reveal wear and tear, best efforts are made to replace parts in-kind.  If this is not possible, then the management of change procedures ensure that (1) any changes in equipment are consistent with good engineering practice, (2) process safety information is updated accordingly, (3) all operations and maintenance procedures are edited as required, and (4) all affected personnel are notified of the change and receive proper training.\n\n \n\nAdditional controls are provided by a rigorous lockout/tagout program, confined space procedures, hot work procedures, hazardous work permits, fire prevention and control procedures and more.  Employees participate fully in the implementation of the accidental release prevention program.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History \n\n\n\nThe Anhydrous Ammonia System at Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. commenced operations in July 2002.  There have been no incidents or accidents in the entire history of the System.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nOntelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. has a three-part emergency response program, consisting of  (1) SA-400 One Plan Emergency Response Procedures,  (2) Emergency Response Plan for Employees and On Call Managers, and  (3) Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe SA-400 document provides separate sets of procedures for a variety of difference emergencies, including but not limited to chemical spills and releases.

Hazard information is provided for each on-site chemical subject to EPCRA-LEPC regulations. \n\n\n\nThe Off-Site Emergency Response Plan described above was developed in a cooperative effort with the Local Emergency Planning Committee for the Emergency Planning District of Berks County to meet the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 11003.  SA-400 is fully consistent with the Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.  Likewise, the Emergency Response Plan for Employees and On Call Managers is integrated with the Off-Site Emergency Response Plan.\n\n\n\nOntelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. works closely with local response personnel to plan for emergencies.  The Leesport Fire Department and the Berks County Emergency Management Agency have toured the site and trained with Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. personnel.  This is an annual coordination with local agencies.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety \n\n\n\nThe Ontelaunee Power Operating Company LLC. strives to improve safety by continually evaluating procedures to implement safer practices, as well as having the RMP and PSM plan evaluated by a qualified external auditing party.
