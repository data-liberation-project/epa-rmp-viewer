      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n \r\nHeartland Catfish (Heartland) owns and operates a catfish processing plant in Itta Bena, Mississippi.  Heartland uses and stores anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) in their Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) in excess of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Threshold of 10,000 lbs.  Heartland has an established Process Safety Management (PSM) program to provide information to employees to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling and processing of highly hazardous materials.  The program emphas the application of management controls and standard operating procedures when addressing the risks associated with handling or working near highly hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe Ammonia Refrigeration System (the System) for Heartland utilizes anhydrous ammonia to function as the heat transfer medium.  The System contains eight (8) high stage compressors, four (4) low stage compressors and five (5) booster compressors.  The System utilizes liquid ammonia injection for oil cooling on four (4) of the compressors and thermosyphoning oil cooling on the remaining eight (8) compressors.\r\n\r\nThe System contains six (6) evaporative condensers to convert the high-pressure ammonia gas into high-pressure ammonia gas is condensed, it is transferred to the high- pressure receiver.\r\n\r\nThe System, which maintains a maximum inventory or 38,000 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia, included four (4) high stage recirculators, which provide high temperature liquid ammonia to various evaporator units in the facility.  The System also includes two (2) low stage recirculators which provide low temperature liquid ammonia to other evaporator units throughout the facility.\r\n\r\nAmmonia vapor is removed from the low temperature accumulator to the suction of the low stage compressors. The discharge from the low stage compressors goes the high stage recirculators, which provide ammonia vapor to the suction of the high stage compressors.  The discharge from the high stage compresso"
