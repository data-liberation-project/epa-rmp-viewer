If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\r\n\r\n2. Facility Information and Regulated Substance:\r\n\r\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage 0f fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, handled and distributed for direct application. Anhydrous ammonia is used for crop production nutrients.  WFS-Easton also periodically retains an OUTSIDE contractor who utilizes a mobile unit for the purpose of blending anhydrous ammonia with phosphoric acid to produce a non-hazardous liquid fertilizer, 10-34-00.  WFS is neither involved in the conversion process, nor does WFS own the conversion equipment.   \r\n\r\nThe maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia would be approximately 170,000 pounds in our two 18,000 gallon storage tanks; and approximately 160,000 pounds available capacity in various 1,450 and 1,000 gallon nurse tanks. The maximum quantity handled at one time would be the unloading of a tank truck holding 40,000-45,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis facility is not constantly manned every work day.  There are approximately 14 employees who may work on the site periodically throughout the year.  The best estimation of full-time equivalency would be 1-2 employees. \r\n\r\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe facility has implemented Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules, the Standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 C"

The facility is required to conduct a semi-annual inspection of all bulk and nurse tank equipment, including load and unload equipment, and perform any needed maintenance to the equipment found during the inspections. Visual checks are to be conducted daily at the facility.\r\n\r\nAs it relates to Process two, or the conversion our contractor has provided WFS with information to support they have a mechanical integrity program in place along with written operating procedures, safe work procedures, emergency action plan and a training program. \r\n\r\n4. The Five-year Accident History PROCESS 1 - HANDLING AND STORAGE:  \r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have: \r\n\r\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; or \r\nb) To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  The Five-year Accident History PROCESS 2 - CONVERSION OF 10-34-00 BY OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR (MIX MOBILE UNIT)\r\n\r\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have:\r\na) Caused any death, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility in question during the conversion process; or \r\nb) To our knowledge resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage at the facility in question during the conversion process.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the contractor has identified one NON-WFS site incident in their safety information; and therefore, in turn WFS noted this in Section 8, Process #2.  \r\n\r\n5. The Emergency Response Program:  \r\n\r\nThe facility has:\r\n\r\na. A written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard, 29 CFR 1910.38 and 40 CFR 68.95. The plan includes a specific section on NH3 Releases and what to do in the event of a release."
