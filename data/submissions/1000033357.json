      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery has been in operation since 1978.  Since its inception, it has been committed to providing a safe environment to its employees and surrounding communities.  This commitment is reflected in the safety and environmental programs that are implemented at the facility.  For example, written procedures have been created for operating the ammonia refrigeration systems.  Only trained operators are permitted to perform system operations.  Woodbridge Winery has also developed a robust maintenance program to ensure the equipment is in good operating condition.  All of these programs are geared towards the prevention of an accidental release at the facility.  In addition, these programs incorporate emergency procedures to mitigate the effects of a release if it does occur.  At such an event, emergency coordinators will assess the situation and notify outside responding agencies as necessary.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery is located at 5950 East Woodbridge Road in Acampo, California.  Ammonia is used in the facility's refrigeration systems to provide cooling for the storage of wine product.  The maximum intended inventory of ammonia for each process and a description of how each process operates are as follows.\n\n\n\nPlant 1\n\nInventory: 50,000 lbs\n\nProcess Description: The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to two high pressure receivers (HPRs).  Liquid is again transferred from the HPRs to two low pressure recirculators (LPR-1 and LPR-2) and the wine chillers.  Associated with LPR-1 is a liquid transfer vessel (LTV) where excess liquid ammonia can be routed back to the HPRs.  Pumped liquid from LPR-1 is sent to a wine chiller, jacketed tanks, and a glycol chiller.  The second low pressure recirculator (LPR-2) pumps low pressure ammonia to the remaining jacketed tanks.  The vapor generated from the heat tran"

The vapor from the recirculators is then pulled to the compressors (4) where the pressure and temperature of the gas is increased.  Compressor discharge (high pressure ammonia vapor, or hot gas) is sent to the condensers (5) where it is condensed to a high pressure liquid and returned to the thermosyphon receiver (TSR) and the HPRs.  The liquid ammonia in the thermosyphon receiver is used to cool the oil in the two FES screw compressors.  Liquid ammonia flows into the oil cooler vessel and the vapor/liquid mixture is syphoned back to the TSR.  A portable auto purger is used to remove non-condensibles collected in the high pressure receiver and the condensers.  The purger is mounted on a portable rack and can be used at both Plant 1 and Plant 2.  As the pressure in the process increases, the purger is connected and left to run for approximately one week to remove any non-condensibles.  The process also has a fire dump box/control box which can be used in only an emergency situation to equalize the pressures between the low side and the high side, or to manually reduce the system pressure.\n\n\n\nPlant 2 \n\nInventory: 160,000 lbs\n\nProcess Description: The refrigeration cycle begins with the transfer of high pressure liquid ammonia from a thermosyphon supply to a high pressure receiver (HPR).

The glycol accumulator sends high temperature liquid ammonia to two glycol heat exchangers.  At the wine chillers and glycol heat exchangers, liquid ammonia partially vaporizes as it absorbs heat from the wine product or glycol flowing inside these units.  The resulting vapor in the heat exchangers is returned to the glycol accumulator.  Vapor from the wine chillers and glycol accumulator is drawn off to the low pressure accumulator which is equipped with a liquid transfer vessel (LTV).

Training for personnel involved with system operations and maintenance;\n\n?    Written procedures for safely introducing modifications to the covered processes;\n\n?

Contractor management policies to ensure contract employee safety while on facility premises;\n\n?    Audit procedures for ensuring that the programs are being implemented in accordance to the regulations; and\n\n?    Employee involvement in program development and implementation.\n\n\n\nIn addition, engineering controls have been implemented to reduce the chance of an accidental release to the environment.  These are comprised of equipment monitoring systems and safety cutouts to shut off the equipment when operating parameters exceed safe operating limits.  Relief valves on pressurized ammonia vessels prevent equipment rupture in the event of overpressurization.  Regular inspections and tests are performed to ensure these controls are in good working order.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\n\n\nA review of the facility's five year accident history showed that there have been no incidents at the facility that meet the RMP criteria for a reportable accident (onsite deaths, injuries, or significant property damage; or known offsite deaths, injuries, property damage, environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place).  In addition, there have been no incidents at the facility in the last five years that resulted in a release of more than the Federal Reportable Quantity (100 pounds).\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWoodbridge Winery has developed an Emergency Action"

The EAP covers procedures for: 1) evacuating and accounting for visitors and employees, 2) addressing ammonia releases and other foreseeable emergencies that could occur onsite, 3) notifying external agencies and emergency response personnel, and 4) administering first aid measures for ammonia exposure.  Employees are informed of the elements of the EAP.  In the event of an ammonia release, employees will evacuate or shelter-in-place, depending on the nature of the release, and the facility will contact the fire department as necessary for assistance.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses and Compliance Audits have been performed on the ammonia refrigeration system, and these studies have resulted in action items to improve safety at the facility.  The recommendations mainly consist of formalizing procedures, implementing practices consistent with industry standards, and performing inspections and tests to maintain the integrity of the equipment.  Woodbridge Winery has implemented several of these action items and is moving forward with completing the remaining outstanding recommendations.   In addition, the facility plans to continue providing employees with a safe work environment through continued training on current policies and procedures, and conducting audits to identify deficiencies and make improvements.\n\n"
