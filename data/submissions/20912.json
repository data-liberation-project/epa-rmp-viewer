      "SummaryText": "Pulaski Chase Cooperative\n428 Third Avenue\nPulaski, Wisconsin 54162\n\nRisk Management Plan - Executive Summary\n\n1. Facility Policy\n\nWe at Pulaski Chase Cooperative are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers such areas as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at the facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with emergency responders to provide highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  To support this activity, anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.  Anhydrous ammonia is a regulated substance by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The maximum quantity stored on site is 120,000 pounds (lbs) in a single large ammonia vessel with the remainder being located in smaller 'nurse' tanks.  The nurse tanks have a 1000-gallon capacity and are filled to a maximum of 85 percent.\n\n3. The Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nThe worst-case release scenario involves a catastrophic release from the large ammonia vessel.  The entire contents of the vessel (i.e., 120,000 lbs) would be released in 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 meters per second (m/s) windspeed, the maximum distance of 3.6 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 milligrams per liter (mg/l).  \n\nThe alternative, or more likely, release scenario involves the release of ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "from a pipe leak.  This scenario involves the release of 2,000 lbs over 4 minutes.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l is 0.2 miles.\n\n4. Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention program requirements set out under the U.S. EPA Chapter 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68.  In addition, we have implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Chapter 29, CFR 1910.111. \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\".  In compliance with these requirements, the following items were identified and reviewed by facility personnel:\n\n          Safety Information\n          Hazard Review\n          Operating Procedures\n          Training\n          Maintenance\n          Compliance Audits (as needed in the future)\n          Incident Investigation (as needed in the future)\n\n5. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years.  Due to stringent release prevention policies, no accidental releases have occurred during this period.  In addition, there have been zero reportable accidents at the facility in the last 30+ years.\n\n6. Emergency Response Plan\n\nThe facility is not the first responder in the event of an accidental release of hazardous materials.  Therefore, the facility does not maintain its own written emergency action plan to deal with such releases.  The Tri-County Fire Department is the first responder to any ammonia emergencies.  All Tri-County firefighters/paramedics are qualified as first responders.\n\n7. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at Pulaski Chase Cooperative.  Periodic evaluations are per"
