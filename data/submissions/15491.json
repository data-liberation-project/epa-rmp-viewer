No other employees are hired to operate this business.  We are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of ammonia, and we are prepared to work with the local fire department and other authorities with any release of product.\n\nThe primary activity at this facility is storage of Anhydrous Ammonia and filling of nurse tanks for sale to farm customers.  The maximum quantity of Anhydrous Ammonia stored here would be 80,000 pounds in our 18000 gallon storage tank.  The maximum quantity handled would be unloading from a truck tanker holding about 40,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over a ten minute period.  The maximum quantity released would be 80,000 pounds which represents the volume of the 18,000 gallon storage tank when filled to 85% capacity.  The distance to the end point of the release would be .8 miles.  The alternate release scenario would most likely be a ruptured transfer hose.  The distance to the end point in this case would be .22 miles.\n\nThis facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of Anhydrous Ammonia from this plant in the last five years, or for that matter, none during our 29 years in business, that have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage including evacuations or environmental damage.  Our facility has provided state and local authorities the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic evaluations are performed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions.  There are no additional specific"
