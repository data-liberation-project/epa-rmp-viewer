      "SummaryText": "El Centro Generating Station (ECGS), located at 485 East Villa Road, El Centro, California operates six power generation units along with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) technology to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) for three combustion turbines.   SCR is a post-combustion flue gas NOX emission control technology that speeds up reaction process for removal of NOX from the flue gas downstream from the combustion process.  A reducing agent is used to reduce NOX emissions, primarily nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), by oxidation-reduction reactions in the presence of a catalyst.  The most common reducing agent (reagent) used with SCR is ammonia.  Injection of the correct ammonia/air mixture into the combustion exhaust stream before the catalyst, initiates the reactions and achieves the desired removal of NOx emissions upstream from the stack.  The ECGS uses anhydrous ammonia (60,000 pounds) as the reagent for the SCR reactions. For this purpose, ECGS stores 60,000 pounds or 12,000 gallons in a single ammonia storage tank.\r\n\r\nDue to the hazardous nature of anhydrous ammonia, ECGS is required to develop and implement specific regulatory requirements, enforced by both local and federal government agencies, including Federal Risk Management Plan (RMP), Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), Process Safety Management (PSM), and a Seismic Analysis (SA) of the facilities, operations, and equipment.    All regulatory requirements for the use and storage of anhydrous ammonia at the ECGS are found within:\r\n\u00bfP\tTitle 40 Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations;\r\n\u00bfP\tTitle 20 Section 1910.119 of the Code of Federal Regulations; and\r\n\u00bfP\tSections 25531 - 25543.3 of the California Health and Safety Code.\r\n\r\nECGS is a generation facility that consists of three steam turbine generators and three gas turbine generators.

Transport of Anhydrous ammonia to ECGS is accomplished by using tanker trucks, with individual deliveries of about 5,000 to 7,000 gallons per delivery. When the units are operating, a delivery is scheduled every three to five weeks.\r\nThe 12,000-gallon horizontal storage tank has an outside diameter of 9-feet with a length of 23-feet and 5-inches.  The Ammonia Storage Tank is located inside an enclosure that is adjacent to the unloading area.  The floor beneath the storage tank is slightly sloped towards a sump (with drain) in the north western corner of the enclosure.  This area is sloped to contain and drain accidental spills.  In addition, the ammonia-handling facility is equipped with extensive ammonia detection and alarm systems to protect workers and equipment in the event of a malfunction anywhere within the system.\r\nThe use of equipment for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia in support of the SCR project will require compliance with several environmental and safety regulatory requirements, including preparation of this RMP pursuant to the CalARP Program.  The quantity of ammonia on-site also triggers the federal RMP program pursuant to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act.  An RMP is required under the CalARP program and at the discretion of the local administering agency (AA).  In Imperial County, the AA is the Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC), which also is the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA).  The DTSC has informed the ECGS that an RMP will be required in connection with the anhydrous ammonia system in operation at their facilities. \r\n\r\nThe original RMP submitted on January 30, 2007 includes a Seismic Analysis (SA), a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA), an Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the proper RMP submittal documentation.

In the future, the ECGS will be required to complete updates to its RMP program on a 5-year basis, if any changes are applied to the ammonia system or the facility or perform updates earlier per RMP regulations.\r\n\r\nDuring 2012, ECGS upgraded some of its power generating units and added additional generating capacity due to the critical need for a load following. The El Centro Unit 3 Repowering Project was implemented which added approximately 144 MW of generation capacity, interconnected to an existing 92 kV system at the El Centro Switching Station. The project consisted of replacing the Combustion Engineering boiler and Westinghouse steam turbine generator with two Siemens SGT-800 combustion turbine generators (CTG), two heat recovery steam generators, and a Siemens SST-600 steam turbine generator. The existing ammonia bulk storage system has remained and continues to be used as the main supply tank for all units along with minor modifications that were made during repowering project including the replacement of the ammonia air vaporizer skids with an updated model of similar design and layout for the new units.\r\nThis document is the RMP prepared for submittal to DTSC to address the facility for the unloading, storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia at the ECGS.

The Anhydrous ammonia will drain rapidly into the enclosure beneath the tank, which will limit the volatilization of the ammonia to the atmosphere.  Due to the quantity of anhydrous ammonia being stored at ECGS, the facility will meet RMP Program's Level 3 requirements.  In addition to analyzing a worst case accidental release scenario, in which the entire 12,000 gallons (60,000 lb) of anhydrous ammonia is released from the tank into the atmosphere within 10 minutes, ECGS will also analyze an alternative case scenario.  The alternative accidental release scenario is the one in which a major damage or accidental disconnection of the anhydrous ammonia hose from the tank or delivery truck during loading and unloading process will result to release of approximately 100 pounds per minute of ammonia into the atmosphere for five minutes.
