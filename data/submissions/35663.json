We will not compromise Environmental, Health or Safety Values for profit or production.  \n\nChlorine, being a hazardous compound listed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is regulated for the management of hazards during the handling and processing of the chemical at Alcoa?s Massena New York facility.  Alcoa has established a risk management program for chlorine to comply with these regulatory requirements, and to protect the health and safety of its employees, the surrounding community and environment.\n\nAlcoa has a written chlorine emergency response plan to ensure that chlorine emergencies are dealt with in a prompt and safe manner.  Only qualified personnel are allowed to assess and contain a leak from a covered process, and trained incident commanders are on site at all times to coordinate such a response.  The emergency response plan includes a protocol for notifying external agencies as necessary. \n\nDescription of the Stationary Source's Regulated Substances and Processes\n\nThe Alcoa facility utilizes chlorine in its aluminum casting process.  Chlorine is used in the process to flux molten aluminum removing impurities from aluminum products.  A maximum of 6,000 pounds is stored, as a gas liquefied by pressure in three (3) one-ton containers.    \n\nAccidental Release Prevention\n\nAlcoa has established a management system meeting the requirements of both the OSHA PSM and EPA RMP standards to help ensure the safe operation of these processes.  To identify situations having the potential to release chlorine, Alcoa analyzed each process for the following: how process elements interact, how the equipment can fail, what happens if it fails, what is in "

In addition, Alcoa has established facility-wide procedures for the management of hazardous activities such as welding, and process-specific procedures to address unique hazards of operation and maintenance for individual processes.  All personnel who may be required to perform these activities have been trained in the proper procedures.  Employees have been asked to participate in the development of the procedures and other relevant documentation related to these processes so their experiences and knowledge can be utilized.  New equipment is thoroughly reviewed before it is placed in service, and all changes are analyzed before they are implemented to ensure they do not create new hazards.\n\nEach incident that occurs at Alcoa is investigated, whether or not chlorine is involved in the incident.  If a chlorine incident were to occur, Alcoa has an emergency response program including facility personnel with training on the proper techniques for handling chlorine releases.  The facility emergency response program contains provisions for coordinating with the St. Lawrence County Emergency Services as necessary.  Alcoa has conducted chlorine incident response drills in the past.\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nThe accident history related to storage and use of chlorine (the covered process) at the facility is required as a component of the facility's RMP.  The facility has had one accident involving chlorine within this five-year history that resulted in a minor injury to an employee. \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAlcoa?s written Emergency Chlorine Response Procedure and its 24-hour Chlorine Emergency Response Team are immediately activated in the event of a release.  The Chlorine Emergency Response Team is trained to handle incidents involving chlorine and the facility maintains appropriate chlorine emergency response equipment.\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety\n\nAlcoa is committed to con"
