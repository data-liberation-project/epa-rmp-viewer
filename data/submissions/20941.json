This Chemical is :   Ammonia for refrigeration.  We currently have maximum storage capacities of 18,000 pounds of Ammonia at the Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit facility.\n\nWayne Farms LLC - DQHI Busines Unit believes that the ammonia we store and handle on site has very real and potential dangers.  However, it is important to keep the risks in perspective.  Wayne Farms LLC -  DQHI Business Unit ammonia storage and handling facilities:\n1.  are properly designed\n2.  have effective operation and maintenance procedures\n3.  employ trained operators and technicians\n4.  periodically conduct safety audits, and\n5.  are constantly upgrading itsr processes to meet or exceed industry standards\n\nWayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit also has taken  a proactive approach towards coordinating emergency efforts with the Oakwood Fire Department.  The Hall County EMA has a copy of our emergency response program and is well trained and prepared to respond to potential spills and leaks that may occur at the  Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit facility.  The Oakwood Fire Department conducts annual site visits toour facility and is prepared to respond to a possible spill or leak.\n\nA facility which maintains high standards such as Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit, provides less public risk that a facility that does not provide safe operations.

      "SummaryText": "onsequences if a major leak occurred.   Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit used EPA's OCA Guidance to develop a model for off-site consequence analysis of ammonia.\n\nWORST-CASE SPILL\nIn the event of a worst-case ammonia release (18,000 pounds in 10-minutes), a .8 mile radius around the Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit facility may have to be notified and possibly evacutated.  According to 1990 Census Data, 856 people in the surrounding community may be notified that an evacuation may be necessary.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE SPILL\nDuring the past five years Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit has had several small releases of ammonia to the atmosphere.  A 990 pound release was used to determine an alternative-release scenario, which would result in a release of ammoinia that may travel .1 miles and may, according to 1990 Census Data, require 21 people in the surrounding community be notified that an evacutation may be necessary.  \n\nCONCLUSION\nWayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit believes that the poultry industry should proactively inform that public of the potential dangers and the actions that Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit has taken to minimize these dangers.  Wayne Farms LLC - DQHI Business Unit has a long, great, ongoing relationship with the community.  We encourage any and all citizens who have concerns or questions to contact our facility.  We look forward to continuing our relationship in Hall County."
