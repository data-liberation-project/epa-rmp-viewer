The success of this policy is evidenced by the safe operation of the facility since its original construction in 1963.  \n7 That there is no smoking permitted anywhere in the building outside of a single designated smoking area.  This keeps fire hazards to a minimum.  \n7 That no vehicles, such as forklifts, are permitted near ammonia refrigeration components, including piping.  Vehicle drivers are trained to use caution wherever refrigeration units are present.  \n7 That all operators and maintenance personnel must be properly trained before they are permitted to work on, or operate, the refrigeration system.  \n7 That all operators and maintenance personnel are required to undergo 24 hour hazardous material training as per OSHA 1910.120 regulations.  This is done to insure their ability to participate in the correction or repair of conditions that might result in an accidental release.  \n7 That every employee, visitor, contractor or truck driver is informed of the safety aspects of the facility.  \n\nDescription of our facility and the regulated substances handled, including how and why we use ammonia.  \n\nOur company supplies refrigerated warehousing to companies in the food business.  Our building is basically a large refrigerator/freezer used to keep food from spoiling.  Refrigeration is an essential component of the health and safety in everyday life of the consumer.  Our facility supplies refrigeration services to thousands of food-related businesses to help insure safe storage and shipment of their products.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is utilized as the essential refrigerant in the cooling system.  Unlike the now-banned or restricted chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs such as certain Freons and Genetrons), ammonia is not an environmental ozone depleter.  When in"

In addition, ammonia is a highly efficient refrigerant.  This translates to lower energy costs, thereby resulting in savings to the consumer, less dependence upon foreign energy imports, as well as less production of public-utility-generated greenhouse gases.  \n\nDescription of the \"worst-case release scenario\" and the \"alternative release scenario\", including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  \n\nWe used the EPA-supplied RMP-Comp software package to perform the release scenario calculations.  As part of our modeling, we have assumed that the building structure will act in the capacity of passive mitigation, to decrease the rate of release to the environment.  \n\nWe have performed a \"worst case scenario\" calculation for a release from a ruptured storage vessel that could potentially hold 423 cubic feet of ammonia.  However, it is our normal operating policy to keep this vessel filled to only about 25 to 35% of capacity.  From our calculations we have concluded that there would be offsite consequences to the surrounding community in the event of an ammonia release.  However, due to our continuous inspection and maintenance procedures, we feel such a release is extremely unlikely.  \n\nWe have also performed \"alternative release scenario\" calculations.  The alternative release we have presented would be if a forklift completely broke one of the major lines in the system.  In this instance the effect on the surrounding location would be drastically less than in the worst case scenario described above.   This is even assuming no active mitigation devices.  However, our protection systems and devices in the refrigeration system make off-site impact even less likely.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and prevention steps relating to the ammonia r"
