A combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs are used to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protect the environment.  As a company, we are committed to excellence in health, safety, and the environment.\nArch Chemicals operates under the philosophy that all accidents are preventable all of the time.  We recently revitalized this commitment with an ambitious new initiative - \"The Goal Is Zero\".  This initiative is all about striving to achieve zero recordable injuries, zero environmental incidents, zero manufacturing process incidents, and zero distribution incidents.  The same dedication to excellence marks our Product Stewardship initiative, under which we address health, safety, and the environment throughout each products' life cycle.  \nThe following sections provide a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities in practice at the Brandenburg facility.  Also attached are the data elements from our risk management program that are required by EPA's RMP rule.\n\n2.0 Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Arch Chemicals Brandenburg facility is a 220-acre site located east of Brandenburg, Kentucky.  The facility is divided into twelve distinct units: Ethylene Oxide, Polysolvs., Light Hydro Carbons (LHC), Polychemicals, Polymer Polyol, Urethane Systems, TDI Terminal, Microelectronics, Pilot Plant, Utilities, and Waste Water Treatment. Primary products of the facility include ethylene oxide, ethylene, propylene glycols, polyether polyols, glycol ethers, and microelectronic chemicals.\n\nIn our processes, we use the following toxic chemicals that EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substant"

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios and our assessment of the potential off site consequences from accidental chemical releases, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario:\n\nToxics: Worst Case Release Scenario\nEthylene Oxide: The selected worst case release scenario assumes the failure of a storage tank containing 127,000 pounds of ethylene oxide.  The required assumption is that the entire contents of the tank are released in 10 minutes. Upon release the liquid forms a pool which evaporates at a rate of 406 lb/min. Using the EPA OCA tables, urban topography and stipulated meteorology (wind speed of 1.5 m/sec and F stability class), and passive mitigation measures, the ethylene oxide could travel up to 8.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  A release of this magnitude could potentially impact area residences and both the Meade County and Harrison County schools.  There are no EPA listed receptors within the impact distance.  Although unrealistic, this scenario meets the requirements of a release of the largest quantity from a from a vessel that has the potential for the farthest off site impact.  Although passive mitigation in the form of dikes were considered for this release scenario, the facility also has sprinkler and deluge systems that would be utilized in a release of this type but were not considered in the consequence analysis.\n\nToxics: Alternate Release Scenario\nIn accordance with the EPA RMP rule, a more credible \"alternate\" release scenario was considered for each toxic chemical.  This scenario is often called the planning scenario beca"

While a number of scenarios are considered for each of the chemicals covered by the RMP, only one for each toxic chemical is presented. All scenarios were evaluated using the EPA OCA tables and the stipulated alternate weather conditions of 3.0 m/sec windspeed and D stability class.\n\nThe alternate release scenarios included in the RMP for the Arch-Brandenburg facility are:\n\nAmmonia: The more credible alternate release scenario for ammonia considers the failure of an ammonia process line due to external erosion. Liquid ammonia is spilled to the gravel surface and 116 pounds is released to the air.  The release lasts for approximately 20 minutes and travels approximately 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\nEthylene Oxide: The more credible alternate release scenario for ethylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 370 pounds is released to the air in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel approximately 1.5 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\nPropylene Oxide: The more credible alternate release scenario for propylene oxide considers a release from a process safety valve in the polychemical area.  Approximately 2270 pounds is released to the air at a height of almost fifty feet in five 30-second lifts.  The resulting plume could travel approximately 0.8 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\nFormaldehyde: The more credible alternate release scenario for formaldehyde considers a leak in a 1.5-inch line.

Approximately 38 pounds of formaldehyde would be released over a ten minute period.  The formaldehyde could travel 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include the Ohio River.\n\n37% Hydrochloric Acid: An evaluation of credible releases of  37% HCl from the facility produced no scenarios that could potentially result in an offsite impact.  The most credible alternate release scenario for 37% HCl considers the puncture of a 55-gallon drum.  Approximately 550 pounds of HCl would spill to the ground.  The resulting plume could travel 0.04 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard. \n\nToluene Diisocyanate: The more credible alternate release scenario for toluene diisocyanate (TDI) considers the failure of a pressure relief valve on an incoming railcar.  Approximately 100 pounds would be released from the vapor space of the railcar.  The resulting plume could travel approximately 0.31 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include Doe Run Creek.\n\nAcrylonitrile: The more credible alternate release scenario for acrylonitrile is the rupture of an unloading hose from a tank truck.  An operator is always present during truck unloading and would stop the unloading pump in approximately one minute.  Approximately 833 pounds of liquid acrylonitrile would be spilled, resulting in a plume that could travel approximately 0.6 miles before dispersing enough to no longer pose a significant hazard to the public.

Because of shutoff valves at the tank truck and the reactor, only 12 pounds of EDA (the contents of the hose) would be spilled. The resulting plume would travel less than 0.06 miles from the area and would remain onsite.\n\nFlammables: Worst Case Release Scenario\n\nPropane: The selected worst case scenario for the group of flammable chemicals at the facility considers the release of a series of eight interconnected storage tanks with a total inventory of approximately 2,880,000 pounds of propane.  This release would result in a vapor cloud explosion that could sustain a 1 psi overpressure (capable of breaking windows, etc.) at distances up to 1.10 miles.  Potentially impacted public receptors would include area residences and the Ohio River.\n\nFlammables: Alternate Release Scenario\n\nEthylene: The selected alternate release scenarios for the group of flammable chemicals at the facility considers the release of approximately 20,000 pounds of ethylene from a storage tank within the Ethylene Oxide manufacturing unit.  This could result in a vapor cloud fire that could impact distance of 0.06 miles before dispersing to a level below its lower flammability limit. \n\n\n4.0 General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA systematic, proactive approach is taken to preventing accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs, including:\n\n7 Employee involvement\n7 Process safety information\n7 Process hazard analysis\n7 Mechanical integrity\n7 Operating procedures\n7 Training\n7 Management of change\n7 Pre-startup reviews\n7 Emergency preparedness\n7 Incident investigation\n7 Hot work permits\n7 Contractor safety performance\n7 Compliance audits\n\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\n1.
