We have located our business in the Industrial Park of Okeechobee County so we are not directly located near subdivisions or private homes or schools.  There are many open areas in the park as well as other companies that carry hazardous chemicals.  We have the cylinders chained in a fenced location and  close to the entrance of the property so that it is easy access for the emergency vehiclies in case there would be a need for emergency assistance.  In the event that a accident occurs we would first call the local emergency authorities, suit up with the SCBA and use the A Kit to contain the cylinder and call our local supplier to come with the coffin and picked up the damaged cylinder.  All of our employees are well trained and work extremely well in case a emergency if this should happen."
