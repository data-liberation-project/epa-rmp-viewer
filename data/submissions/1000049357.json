If an accidental release should occur, the facility will work with the local fire department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. An Emergency Response Plan has been developed and would be implemented in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nTHE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nThe primary business at the facility is to sell fertilizers, agricultural pesticides, and agronomic services to growers and ranchers. To conduct this business, the following activities occur at the facility:\n\na.    Storage and delivery of bulk and packaged containers of fertilizers, bulk and packaged containers of agricultural chemicals, and packaged seed. All fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and seed are distributed to growers. No mixing or formulating of agricultural chemicals occurs at the facility.\n\nb.

Per EPA guidance, the results of the worst-case and alternative release scenarios are not reported in the Executive Summary, but are available in the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and U.S. EPA risk management plan (RMP) RMP report.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION"
