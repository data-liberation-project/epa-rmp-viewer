      "SummaryText": "Description of water system for Helena, Montana\n\nThe City of Helena's Water Department (HWD) goal is to ensure customer\nsatisfaction by consistently delivering high quality water today and in the future.\n\nThe HWD serves more than 25 thousand customers with 9364 service taps including 155 fire\nlines with an average of 5.2 million gallons of water per day on an annual basis. The total annual\ngallonage from all sources for 1998 is 1.866BG* with a peak day of 12.2MG*. To supply this\namount of water, we operate two surface water treatment plants--the Missouri River Water\nTreatment Plant (MRTP) located at 2560 Canyon Ferry Road, and the Tenmile Water Treatment\nPlant west of Helena at 1115 Rimini Road. The Tenmile Water Plant is in operation year round\nwhile the MRTP is used only during the summer months for peak demands.  Additional water is\nobtained from the Hale system which consists of the Oro Fino and Eureka well collectors. The\ndepartment's two treatment plants are maintained, evaluated and upgraded to stay abreast of\nadvancements in technology, health science and governmental regulations.\n\nThe Helena water distribution system consists of five finished water storage reservoirs (Malben,\nWinne, Hale and Upper Hale, Woolston) and pumping stations (Forrest Estates, Hale, Eureka,\nDahlhausen, Reeders Village) linked together with 185 miles of water transmission and\ndistribution pipelines. The Chessman (530MG) and Scott (195MG) reservoirs in the Tenmile\nwatershed also provide additional water for the Tenmile Water Plant during low flows. These\nreservoirs are filled with spring run off water.  \n\nCarollo Engineers of Boise, Idaho completed a Water Master Plan Update for the City of Helena\nin April 1997. The Public Works Department has copies of the Water Master Plan if customers\nwould like to review it. Phase one of this update determined that the existing Missouri River\nTreatment Plant should be rehabilitated or replaced due to age of equipment, public health risks,\nand oper"

The least\ncostly scenario was to replace the capacity of the existing plant with high quality groundwater\nsupplies if available. Test drilling of these wells has started in 1998.\n\nThe Facility and Regulated Substances\nThis is a local government owned and operated facility for the production of potable water for the\nCity of Helena.  The only reportable regulated substance for the RMP plan is chlorine.  One to\ntwo tons of chlorine are stored at this facility in ton cylinders.  No more than two ton cylinders\nare on line at a time.  The online tanks are on isolated regulators that reduce the chlorine pressure\nto a vacuum state.  Chlorine feed equipment supplies a vacuum to the tanks allowing the release\nof chlorine to the feeders.  All feed lines supply chlorine below atmospheric pressure.  Should a\nleak develop the feeders would be unable to supply enough vacuum to continue the release of\nchlorine and the feed would stop at the Chlorine Pressure Reducing Valve(CPRV) attached to the\ntank.  Each tank has its own CPRV.  No flammable substances are stored in the chlorine room.\n\nTwo operators are required for changing chlorine tanks as part of our standard operating\nprocedures.  Self Contained Breathing Apparatus(SCBA) are stored in an adjacent room on wall\nmounted quick release brackets.  An emergency repair kit is available.  A chlorine detector is\ninstalled in the room connected to an alarm panel and autodialer.  If an alarm condition exists it\nwill call personnel till acknowledged.  All alarms and autodialers are on uninterruptable power\nsupplies, batteries. \n\nWorst-Case Scenario\nThe worst case scenario would be the total loss of one ton of chlorine through catastrophic valve\nor tank failure.  There are no mitigation controls.  Response time could be so limited(less than an\nhour)that under the right conditions total loss of one ton of chlorine is possible.\n\nAlternate Scenario\nValve failur"

Operators would close the tank valve thus\nshutting off the chlorine so repairs can be made.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention\nOperators are trained in the proper way to change tank CPRV's.  Regular maintenance is kept on\nthe CPRV's, lines, and feeders.  Cylinders with exceptionally difficult or tight valves are\nreturned.  SCBA's are kept in a separate room.  Operators are trained in proper leak detection and\ncorrection needed.  Two operators are required for tank changes or repairs.  A third operator is\nnotified of any leaks and told to notify emergency responders if no communications for more\nthan 20 minutes. \n\nFive Year Accident History\nNo accidents in the last five years.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nAs written in the plant emergency response manual.  This manual is stored on  the office desk. \nThese manuals are stored in plain view by office door.\n\nPlanned Changes\nNew improvements include a groundwater supply in combination with a new Missouri River\nTreatment Plant.  This includes a new clearwell, chlorine equipment, and high service pump\nstation.  Storage includes a new east side reservoir.  This new construction will begin in one to\ntwo years from now depending on budget restraints and final approval from City and Community\nadvisory groups."
