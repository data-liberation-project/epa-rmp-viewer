This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training site personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of the facility's processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will evaluate the situation, take actions within the capabilities of the facility, and notify the necessary outside agencies. The Latham Gas plant is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals (flammable mixture), so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe Latham Gas plant located near Platteville, Colorado uses cryogenic fractionation to separate heavier hydrocarbons from feed gas to produce marketable natural gas. As a result of this operation, several EPA regulated flammable substances (a flammable mixture containing methane, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane, iso-pentane and n-pentane) are processed, recovered and stored at the facility.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place for the covered process at the facility.\nLatham Gas plant has a program in place to comply with the provisions of the accidental release prevention regulations under 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the existing release prevention program.\n\nProcess Safety Information [40 CFR Part 68.65]\nLatham Gas plant maintains a detailed record of process safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs assoc"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP (Hazard and Operability). The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Latham Gas plant maintains detailed written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nLatham Gas plant has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nLatham Gas plant carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment include pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices. Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change [MOC] [40 CFR Part 68.75]\nWritten procedures are in place at Latham Gas plant to manage changes in process chemicals, tec"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nLatham Gas plant conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nLatham Gas plant promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum period of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation [40 CFR Part 68.83]\nLatham Gas plant believes that Process Safety Management and accident prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Latham Gas plant employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP and PSM rules, including information resulting from Process Hazard Analyses in particular.\n\nHot Work Permit [40 CFR Part 68.85]\nLatham Gas plant has a hot work permit that requires issuance of a hot work permit for hot work operation"

Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out. Latham Gas plant has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards associated with the contractor's work and the corresponding processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\n\nLatham Gas Plant has had no accidental releases during the past five years that meet the criteria for an accidental release as discussed in 40 CFR 68.42.\n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\n\nThe Latham Gas Plant retains a written site-specific formal emergency action plan (EAP), which includes the designated actions the company and all personnel will take to ensure personal safety from fire, unwanted releases of highly hazardous chemicals, and other emergencies.  The intent of this plan is to facilitate the prompt evacuation of employees when necessary and to account for all personnel.  The emergency plan also includes procedures for handling small releases. This facility is a non-responding facility and relies on the Platteville Fire Department to respond to chemical releases. \n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nLatham Gas plant plans to continue to evaluate the regulated process as required under the PSM/RMP standards to ensure safe operations.
