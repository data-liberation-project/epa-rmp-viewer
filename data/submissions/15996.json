The entire amount of anhydrous ammonia on site is approximately 22,000 pounds and is entirely contained in one system that is used for plant refrigeration and product freezing.  Carolina Culinary Foods is commited to the safety of the ammonia refrigeration system and the implementation of the requirements under the Risk Management Program of 40 CFR Part 68 and the Process Safety Management Program of 29 CFR 1910.119.  \n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods, L.P. is dedicated to the safe operation of its refrigeration system and to the safety of the employees, public, and environment.  Carolina Culinary Foods conducts employee training in accordance with the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200.  We also perform annual HAZWOPER training and retraining of key employees who will perform entry work during an ammonia release.  Carolina Culinary Foods has also invited the Cayce Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT members onsite to make them more aware and informed of our plant, process, and system.\n\n\"Worst Case\" Scenario and \"Alternative Release\" Scenario\n\nIn following with the requirements of the RMP, Carolina Culinary Foods has determined a \"worst case scenario\" and an \"alternative release scenario\" for anhydrous ammonia from our system.  The \"worst case scenario\" involves a rupture of our high pressure receiver.  Through review by  the manufacturer of the ammonia system it has been determined that the HP Receiver has a maximum inventory of 12,320 lbs.

Per the Cayce Department of Public Safety, the approximiate population within a 1.5 mile radius of Carolina Culinary Foods is 4,007.  The \"alternative release scenario\" involves an overpressurization of the condensing tower resulting in a shank relief valve discharge.  Through review by the manufacturer and plant maintenance we have come to the conclusion that the relief valve would stay open for approximately 5 minutes and release approximately 21 pounds per minute resulting in a release endpoint of .1 miles.\n\nFive Year Accident History:\n\nNo accidents in past five years.\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard and has imlemented a  Process Safety Management Program to minimize the exposure of its employees, the public, and the environment from an anhdrous ammonia release.  The ammonia system is constantly monitored by computer and employees to ensure that all equipment is operating within expected parameters.   Procedures have been written and implemented on how to properly isolate and shutdown the refrigeration system components in the event of an emergency.  Multiple safety devices are used on each piece of equipment to protect from an accidental release.  \n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nCarolina Culinary Foods has developed a plan to provide notification and evacuation of plant employees and the surrounding public.  Procedures have been developed to notify the Cayce Fire Department and Lexington County HAZMAT Team to respond to any substantial ammonia release.  Procedures have also been developed for the notification of the Lexington County LEPC and the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).  Key employees have been trained in either 24 OR 40  Hour HAZWOPER so that they will able to assist the Cayce Fire Department an"

Through this review process we identify and implement changes to improve system safety."
