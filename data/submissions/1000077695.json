The operation of this facility adheres to the guidelines of the Chlorine Institute and\r\nto the OSHA regulations regarding Process Safety Management. Process Safety Information is\r\nreadily available to all personnel and is updated when changes are made.\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)The original PHA review was conducted in June 2009 appropriate to the\r\ncomplexity of the chlorination process that identified, evaluated, and controlled potential hazards\r\nusing the What-If Checklist and a Hazard Review Checklists processes. These processes\r\ninclude the analysis of hazards due to equipment malfunction and human error. It describes steps\r\nused to detect and monitor releases. This PHA will be updated every three years and the Corning WWTP will conduct reviews whenever major changes occur to the process.\r\nOperating Procedures. The WWTP plant operator has prepared written standard operating\r\nprocedures specific to their operations that provide clear instructions for the safe operational\r\nactivities associated with the process. These procedures are included in the facility operations\r\nmanual and the Process Safety Management manual.
