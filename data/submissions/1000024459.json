Rohm and Haas became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company in 2009.  As such all Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC operations in Cincinnati, Ohio share leveraged support and management and are collectedly called Cincinnati Operations.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nCincinnati Operations is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Reading Fire Department and the Hamilton County Emergency Planning committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.  \n\n\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces several different specialty chemicals and additives.  Most are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  Since the 2006 RMP submittal, there have been very few changes with the manufacturing processes.  \n\nCincinnati Operations handle and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP regulated toxic substances at the Cincinnati Operations:\n\n     Chlorine\n\n         Methyl Chloride\n\n         Ammonia\n\n\n\nThe alternative release scenarios provided within this RMP have been developed by considering the following: previous incidents at the facility (e.g., hose leaks, seal failures, safety valve releases) that have involved chemicals, items"

The RMP regulations provide for the use of assumptions influencing dispersion that are more likely to occur during an alternative release scenario.\n\n\n\nThe worst case consequence analysis indicated that using the EPA guidelines there could be off-site impact in the event of an incident.  For example, a catastrophic release of chlorine from a railcar (defined by the RMP regulations as the worst case) would impact 14 miles of the surrounding community.  The alternative release scenarios that were developed for each chemical indicated that the impact zone would be significantly reduced by comparison to that predicted for the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nThe likelihood of either of these scenarios occurring is very small demonstrating Cincinnati Operation's ability to handle chemicals in a safe manner.  In fact, the reduced impact areas of the alternative scenarios compared to the worst case scenario is one measure of the effectiveness of Cincinnati Operations prevention and safety programs.\n\n\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDEDNT HISTORY\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been only one accidental release as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.   \n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION POGRAM\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations general prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA, RMP, OSHAs PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.  Key elements include:  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations maintain a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.  Examples include Material Safety Data Sheets for all the hazardous chemicals.  Equipment Design Specificati"

This information is maintained up-to-date and is available to operating personnel.  \n\n\n\nProcess hazard Analysis\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified, evaluated, and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include:  Checklists, What If/Checklists (combined), Audits, Reactive Chemical Process hazard Analyses, Chemical Exposure Index, Fire & Explosion Index, and Layers of Protection Analyses.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at regular intervals.  Any findings related to the hazards analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, The Cincinnati Operations maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided on a continuing basis.  \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations carry out a highly documented Planned Preventative Maintenance Program (PPM) which provides checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others:  pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent system, emergency shutdown system, controls, pump and compressors.

Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations require management of all modifications to process equipment, procedures, raw materials, and processing conditions other than \"like for like\", by identifying and review them prior to implementation of changes.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and are trained to deal with the modification.   \n\n\n\nPre-Startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews, related to new processes and to modification in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at the Cincinnati Operations.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintence procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operations.\n\n\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nSelf assessments and audits are conducted on a regular basis to determine whether the provision set out under the RMP rule are being implemented,  Audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe prompt manner.\n\n\n\nIncident investigation\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations investigates any incident that has the resulted in, or could reasonably result in a significant release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort.

Cincinnati Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractors work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Reading Fire Department and the Hamilton County Emergency Planning Committee.  \n\n\n\nThe Cincinnati Operations carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid, and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.  \n\n\n\nTo ensure proper functioning, routine emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.
