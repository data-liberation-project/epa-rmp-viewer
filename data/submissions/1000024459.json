Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is performed.   Cincinnati Operations has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractors work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\r\nThe emergency response program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  Detailed emergency response plans are developed and coordinated with the Reading Fire Department and the Hamilton County Emergency Planning Committee.  \r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati Operations carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid, and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas.  The plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our process that would require a modified emergency response.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure proper functioning, routine emergency drills are conducted to enhance skills and tactics for responding to an accidental chemical release.

Cincinnati Operations has reviewed the chemicals currently used on site as part of the compliance program involving the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, RCRA, Spill Prevention and Contingency Planning and Accidental Release Prevention.  Further, Cincinnati Operations conducts Process Safety Management reviews at least every three years to ensure that each process that utilizes hazardous chemicals are thoroughly examined, including Hazardous and Operability (HAZOP) analysis and Major Accident Prevention Program (MAPP) studies. \r\nCincinnati Operations strives to continually improve employee training, chemical processes, control technology, inspections, repair and maintenance of process equipment in order to improve safety.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PROGRAMS AND CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\r\nThe Rohm & Haas Chemicals LLC Cincinnati facility is governed by a set of OSHA and USEPA regulations that require planning and facility activities to prevent a release of hazardous material, or if a release inadvertently occurs, to minimize the consequences of a release to the employees of the facility, the public, and the environment.

Rohm and Haas became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company in 2009.  As such all Rohm and Haas Chemicals LLC operations in Cincinnati, Ohio share leveraged support and management and are collectedly called Cincinnati Operations.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\r\nCincinnati Operations is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If such a release should occur, our highly trained emergency response personnel are at hand to control and mitigate the effects of the release.  We are also completely coordinated with Reading Fire Department and the Hamilton County Emergency Planning committee which provides additional emergency response expertise.  \r\n\r\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\nThe Cincinnati Operations is a manufacturing facility that annually produces several different specialty chemicals and additives.  Most are intermediates used in other processes or sold to customers who convert them into finished products.  Since the 2006 RMP submittal, there have been very few changes with the manufacturing processes.  \r\nCincinnati Operations handle and stores threshold quantities of the following RMP regulated toxic substances at the Cincinnati Operations:\r\n\t Chlorine\r\n         Methyl Chloride\r\n         Ammonia\r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenarios provided within this RMP have been developed by considering the following: previous incidents at the facility (e.g., hose leaks, seal failures, safety valve releases) that have involved chemicals, items"

The RMP regulations provide for the use of assumptions influencing dispersion that are more likely to occur during an alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nThe worst case consequence analysis indicated that using the EPA guidelines there could be off-site impact in the event of an incident.  For example, a catastrophic release of chlorine from a railcar (defined by the RMP regulations as the worst case) would impact 14 miles of the surrounding community.  The alternative release scenarios that were developed for each chemical indicated that the impact zone would be significantly reduced by comparison to that predicted for the worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nThe likelihood of either of these scenarios occurring is very small demonstrating Cincinnati Operation's ability to handle chemicals in a safe manner.  In fact, the reduced impact areas of the alternative scenarios compared to the worst case scenario is one measure of the effectiveness of Cincinnati Operations prevention and safety programs.\r\n\r\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDEDNT HISTORY\r\nThe Cincinnati Operations has had an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last 5 years.  Due to our stringent release prevention policies, there has been only one accidental release as defined by the RMP rule of regulated substances, during this period.   \r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVETION POGRAM\r\nThe Cincinnati Operations general prevention program consists of compliance with the EPA, RMP, OSHAs PSM standard, and implementation of Dow's Operating Discipline Management System.
