The plant was initially constructed in and, as is true with most industrial plants, has undergone extensive modifications and additions over the years. This plant is subject to the EPA Risk Management Program Rule as it has an ammonia refrigeration system which contains more than 10,000 pounds of ammonia. Ocean Beauty Seafoods has complied with both the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard and the EPA Risk Management Program.\n\nThe City of Kodiak is located on the northeast coast of Kodiak Island and the plant is located in the industrial/commercial are of the City, to the Southeast of the city center. Topographically, there is a steep mountain ridge close to and north and west of the plant. Under the worst case release scenario, the ammonia cloud reaches only to the end of the marina where it dissipates to below 200 ppm before reaching the city center. The only human receptors in this are other seafood processing plants and commercial businesses that support the fishing industry. As these other seafood processing plants are also subject to the Risk Management Program, they are prepared with emergency plans in the event of a release. \n\nThe more sensitive types of receptor such as schools and hospitals would be unaffected for two reasons. First, the public schools and the hospital in Kodiak are located beyond the furthest point of the worst case distance that the ammonia cloud would travel. Secondly, both the schools and the hospital are several hundred feet of elevation gain above sea level where the release would have occurred. Since ammonia clouds follow the lowest path, it is unlikely that any significant ammonia would reach these locations.\n\nWith a significant release (>500 pounds), the affected receptors are in industrial and commercial establishments near the plant.

      "SummaryText": "es would be contacted by phone so that they can initiate their emergency plans.\n\nThe Kodiak area, like much of Alaska, is rich in wildlife and eagles, deer and other animals may wander near the plant site, although this happens infrequently. It is possible but unlikely that an animal may be caught in the cloud. Since this is an unlikely event and there are strong populations of animals on the island, this remote possibility should not be viewed with alarm.\n\nThe Ocean Beauty Kodiak plant is committed to a strong safety and accident prevention program. Even before the RMP rule applied, Ocean Beauty participated in emergency response training and drills. There is a continuing dialogue with the Kodiak Fire Department who would be the first responder in the event of a significant release.\n"
