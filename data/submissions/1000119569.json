      "SummaryText": "cation is situated along Kilroy Road, approximately 0.6 miles south of West Main Street and 0.7 miles west of Highway 99. The area is primarily industrial with sparse residential areas to all sides. \n\nThe facility manufactures food products such as orange juice, flavored drinks, ice cream, sour cream, cheese, and yogurt. The facility was originally built in 1988. The facility was later expanded in 1994 to install additional processing equipment, covering approximately 148,000 square feet. In 2018, Super Store Industries began construction on a second refrigeration system for additional manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThe Super Store Industries Turlock Dairy Division uses anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant within two separate closed systems. The systems, consisting of piping, valves, and equipment, cycle ammonia through various physical states (high pressure liquid, low pressure liquid, low pressure vapor, high pressure vapor, then back to high pressure liquid) in order to provide refrigeration for cold storage rooms and process equipment. Changes in pressure are directly related to changes in temperature. For example, lowering the ammonia pressure lowers its temperature. Low pressure (cold) liquid ammonia provides refrigeration by removing ambient heat. Removal of ambient heat causes the liquid ammonia (contained within the system) to vaporize. Heat is later removed from the ammonia as it is condensed back into a liquid. Typical operating conditions range from vacuum (approximately 14.4\" Hg) on the low pressure side of the system to 150-160 psig on the high side.\n\nAmmonia is used as the refrigerant in the refrigeration processes. \n\nAmmonia refrigeration systems do not experience any chemical reactions or internal corrosion. The only composition change that occurs within the systems are phase changes, as ammonia is cycled through various stages of liquid and vapor, similar to a household refrigerator. The refrigeration systems are closed-loop system without any regular"

A priority list is developed, and target dates are set for the recommendations to reduce or eliminate hazards.\n\nOperating Procedures\nWritten procedures and policies are in place that establish how the refrigeration system is operated and maintained. Super Store Industries has developed standard operating procedures for the required operating phases such as the safe and normal operation and shutdown of the Super Store Industries refrigeration system. The manufacturer\u0092s OEM manual may be used for reference. The standard operating procedures are periodically reviewed to ensure they reflect the current operating practices and certified to such annually.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nPrevention is the primary reason regular and scheduled inspection, testing, and maintenance is performed on the Super Store Industries refrigeration system. The system shall follow manufacturer recommendations, industry RAGAGEP, and/or industry practice to help maintain the system. The facility utilizes a mix of authorized and trained personnel and outside contractors to perform routine and emergency maintenance on the system.\n\nIncident Investigation\nWritten procedures and forms are in place detailing how and when the facility must investigate releases. Super Store Industries investigates releases and near misses that could have resulted in a release of anhydrous ammonia. Recommendations are addressed and corrected by facility management. Reports are kept for five years. \n\nTraining\nSuper Store Industries certifies operators following completion of operator training and confirmation of the operator's ability to apply what they have learned.
