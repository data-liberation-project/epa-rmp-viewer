Accordingly, Provisions Food Company, Inc., has implemented the Process Safety Management System (PSM) as the standard for managing the operation and maintenance of the ammonia refrigeration systems at its facility. In doing so, Provisions Food Company, Inc., ensures that the company will meet or exceed the OSHA standard 29 CFR OSHA 1910.119 governing the use and storage of hazardous materials.  Provisions Food Company, Inc .,  has not experienced any releases of hazardous materials within the past 5 year period.\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant in a large number of industrial facilities.  Ammonia is a toxic gas under ambient conditions and ammonia releases therefore have the potential for harmful effects on workers and the public.  OSHA and EPA regulate facilities with quantities of hazardous materials which exceed certain threshold quantities (10000 pounds for ammonia).  Provisions Food Company, Inc ., Uses 13000 pounds of ammonia in the operation of refrigeration systems that are necessary in the manufacture of wholesome dairy products. \nThe Company's commitment to maintaining our safety record is unequivocal.  We seek to institutionalize an effective ammonia process management program throughout the organization that maximizes safety while optimizing performance.  The elements of this program include training and participation of all employees (including management) in the appropriate preventative actions and response to accidental release of ammonia.  The program incorporates the conduct of audits, periodic reviews of plans and documents and periodic certification of personnel, safety equipment, and alarm systems.  \nA sophisticated matrix of primary and backup safety devices and alarm systems, both passive and active in natu"

Third party safety inspections are conducted on routine and/or unannounced basis by local community safety authorities.\nThe emergency response program\nOur emergency response program is the outgrowth of the company emergency preparedness planning accomplished within the PSM.  The Emergency Preparedness Plan is the central document to all pre-emergency planning.  This document defines the responsibilities of responders and the facilities relationship with outside agencies.  In the event of an emergency procedures have been established to facilitate the emergency response process.  All emergency telephone numbers and evacuation routes are posted in locations throughout the facility.  Controlled copies of the Emergency Preparedness Plan have been distributed to the staff to use as reference and training tool.  All personnel who have specific responsibilities, other than evacuation, during an emergency, are trained to carry out their responsibilities.  The presence of all hazardous materials has been communicated to the Visalia Fire Department.  Training drills are held semi-annually to ensure that every employee participates.  Drills include the participation of the Local Fire Department to familiarize them with the facility layout.  Additionally, copies of the Material Safety Data Sheets has been furnished to Kaweah Delta district Hospital and Valley Industrial Medical Clinic to facilitate medical response to possible chemical exposures."
