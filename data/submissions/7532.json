      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nLocated in southeastern Pennsylvania, the Borough of West Chester is the county seat of Chester County and is an industrial and commercial center with approximately 18,000 residents.  The Borough of West Chester covers an area of approximately 1.9 square miles and lies across two watersheds: Goose Creek, a tributary of the Chester Creek, and Taylor Run, a tributary of the East Branch of the Brandywine Creek.\n\nThe Borough of West Chester maintains two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), one serving each watershed.  The Taylor Run WWTP was built in 1923 and rebuilt in 1984.  Taylor Run WWTP is capable of treating 1.8 million gallons per day to the level required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nThe primary purpose of a WWTP is to protect public waterways from environmental harm and to promote the recreational, commercial, and/or industrial use of these waterways.  The WWTP helps to achieve and maintain water quality goals by achieving a high degree of treatment of all incoming wastewater prior to discharge to Taylor Run.\n\nAll incoming wastewater is disinfected by using chlorine to kill any pathogenic organisms before discharging the water.  A maximum of 2 one-ton containers (4,000 pounds) of chlorine may be stored onsite at any time, with 1 chlorine container in use at any given time.  The containers are located in a brick building designed specifically and solely for the safe movement, storage and use of chlorine.\n\nTaylor Run WWTP's accidental release prevention program is designed to ensure that the facility operates in compliance with the RMP Rule and with industry standards of performance, such as the guidance documents written by the Chlorine Institute.  The prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n* High level of training of the operators\n* Preventive maintenance program\n* Use of state-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n* Use of accurate "

      "SummaryText": "and effective standard operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators\n* Performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n* Implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nPreventive maintenance is regularly scheduled and performed.  Trained, experienced vendors clean, service and replace pipes, valves, chlorinators, rotameters and other equipment, as needed.\n\nChemical-specific prevention steps include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), worn by operators during connection/disconnection of chlorine supply, awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of chlorine, and the presence of chlorine detectors.\n\nChlorine gas is fed into the wastewater with vacuum operated equipment, which offer the safest operation for low capacities.  Piping and connections are kept to a minimum for safety.  The piping was designed to be the shortest necessary length, and is properly supported and protected from risks of excessive heat or fire.\n\nTaylor Run WWTP is not required to maintain a site-specific emergency response program, as defined by OSHA and EPA.  However, it does have an Emergency Plan which has been coordinated with the LEPC, which gives specific details regarding emergency contacts, potentially affected areas, evacuation routes, and other information regarding the WWTP.  The WWTP would contact the local fire department and the Chester County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) in the event of an accidental release, since it does not train its employees to handle such an emergency.\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis includes consideration of two chlorine release scenarios, identified as \"worst case release\" and \"alternative scenario\".  The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the owner or operator shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes,\" due to an unspecified failure.  EPA also requires the assumption of worst-case atmosph"

The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\".\n\nThe worst-case scenario for an accidental release of chlorine is the catastrophic failure of a one-ton container.  The toxic endpoint selected by EPA for chlorine is 3 parts per million (ppm), which is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action\".  This is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG-2).  The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance has to be defined \"to estimate the population potentially affected\".\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions, a distance to toxic endpoint of 1.0 miles and an estimated residential population potentially affected of 2,300 was obtained.  The building that houses the containers was considered as a passive mitigation system to reduce the potential risk.\n\nThe alternate-case release scenario is identified as a major leak caused by a bad valve, a poor connection, or a piping failure.  This scenario was selected as \"a more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario\" based on the past history of chlorine releases at this facility and at other WWTPs that are similarly designed.\n\nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for the alternate scenario was performed, a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.2 miles and an estimated residential population potentially affected of 30 was obtained.  In addition to being enclosed in a building (passive mitigation) when the containers are in use, active mitigation measur"

An aerial photograph was used to confirm the estimated residential population in the alternate case scenario.\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of chlorine in the past five years.\n\nBased on the hazard evaluation, the compliance audit, and other actions taken to prepare this RMP, a few areas were identified for improvement and changes were made to improve safety at the facility.  This included the following:\n\n* Updating the Material Safety Data Sheet for chlorine;\n* Writing a standard operating procedure for connecting and disconnecting containers;\n* A more formal documentation system for employee training;\n* Revising the preventive maintenance procedures;\n* Developing an Emergency Action Plan."
