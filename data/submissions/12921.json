      "SummaryText": "Foremost Farms USA (Foremost Farms) stores up to 10,770 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the dairy plant located at 2294 Randall Road, Athens, Wisconsin (the Property).    Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the fluid milk dairy facility. The quantity stored exceeds the 10,000 pound TQ for ammonia, and is therefore regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  Foremost Farms contracted Northern Environmental to prepare a Risk Management Program for ammonia at the Milan facility.  The Risk Management Program consists of five elements:  the management system, hazard assessment, prevention program, emergency response, and the risk management plan (RMP) submittal.\n\nThe Foremost Farms-Milan management system lists Mr. Dan Williams, Plant Manager, as having overall responsibility for implementation of the risk management program. Facility managers and supervisors assist the plant manager as delegated.\n\nThe hazard assessment included an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) and a summary of the 5-year accident history.  The OCA's worst-case release scenario was the loss of 2,570 pounds of ammonia from the refrigeration system, resulting in a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.9 miles. The OCA's selected alternative release scenario was a release of 2060 pounds of ammonia in ten minutes and a distance to toxic endpoint of 0.3 miles.  According to 1990 Census data, there are a total of 68 persons within the worst-case vulnerable zone, and 8 persons within the alternative release vulnerable zone.  Recreation areas are also located within both the worst-case and alternative release vulnerable zones. There have not been any accidents within the last five years that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nBecause ammonia is also regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the prevention program elements under Program 3 of 40 CFR Part 68 apply.
