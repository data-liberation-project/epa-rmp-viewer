We promote health, safety, and the environment through programs of awareness, compliance, prevention and protection.  These programs include a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n\n\nA.    Description of our facility and the use of substances regulated by EPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule.\n\nB.    Overview of our accidental release prevention programs.\n\nC.    Five-year accident history for accidental releases.\n\nD.    Overview of our emergency response program.\n\nE.    Overview of planned changes to improve safety.\n\n\n\nThis accidental release prevention program is being submitted to establish an RMP for the Furnace Off-Gas System as well the inclusion of the existing Process Safety Management Plan for the Off-Gas Conversion section of the Acid Plant.\n\n\n\nA. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Rio Tinto Kennecott Smelter, Furnace Off-Gas system is located approximately 5 miles west of Magna, Utah.   The Smelter receives concentrated ore (concentrate) produced from the nearby Bingham Canyon Mine and processes it through a set of high-temperature furnaces to produce a high-grade copper anode. The combustion of the sulfur-bearing copper concentrate in the furnaces generates an exhaust stream of which sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a significant component. This exhaust stream is then captured by the Off-Gas system and transported via ductwork to the Sulfuric Acid Production area, where the SO2 is converted into Sulfur Trioxide (SO3) with Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) being the final product offered for sale to various industrial markets.\n\n \n\nIn our process, we u"

The Rio Tinto Kennecott Smelter is located a safe distance from any residential area, however, it is located adjacent to an independent industrial facility providing production materials for the Smelting process. It is the proximity of this facility (public receptor) and the additional presence of a chemical covered by the OSHA PSM regulation, Sulfur Trioxide (although not it is below EPA Threshold  quantity), that mandate the Rio Tinto Kennecott Smelter be classified as \"Prevention Program Level 3\" as set forth in Section 68 of the EPA regulations.\n\n\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Kennecott Utah Copper Smelter does not use, store, or handle any flammable materials covered by the RMP regulation. The Smelter does store propane for use strictly as fuel gas for the operation of our own furnaces in the event our natural gas supply is curtailed or interrupted, however, the EPA considers fuel gas stored for this purpose to be exempt from the RMP rule.\n\n\n\nB. GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe centerpiece of the accidental release prevention program is the Risk Management Program (RMP).  The twelve (12) elements of the RMP constitute the framework by which process safety and accident prevention are managed in the unit.  These twelve (12) individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases. Rio Tinto Kennecott and our employees are committed to the standards required by these management systems and to the prevention of accidental releases.  In addition to the above prevention program elements, we also have specific prevention measures that are employed as part of our operating procedures and engineering and administrative controls to help contai"

This equipment includes portable fire extinguishers, self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), encapsulated chemical protective suits, rescue and medical equipment, and firefighting apparatus capable of delivering high volumes of water and firefighting foam.  An inspection, testing and preventive maintenance program is in place for emergency response equipment.\n\n\n\nE. PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nRio Tinto Kennecott is continually striving to make the Smelter a safe workplace for our employees, contractors, our neighbors and our community.  Our focus is safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operations, and proactive management of these issues.  Process Hazard Assessments (PHA) have recently been performed for the furnace Off-Gas system, as well as the Sulfuric Acid Production unit. These assessments are designed to identify opportunities for improvement. Compliance audits of the RMP program are conducted every three years, and any changes found in the PHA are required to be resolved within one year. These recommendations are presently being resolved as will any future opportunities for the prevention of accidental release per the regulatory schedule referenced above.\n\n"
