      "SummaryText": "Programs for chlorine release prevention and emergency response policies are reviewed and up-dated by Worthington Public Utilities staff in coordination with the MMUA (Minnesota Municipal Utilities Association).  Chlorine is the most hazardous substance that we handle and any release will set the Emergency Response Plan into motion.  The Wastewater Plant is a facility that uses chlorine for the disinfection of wastewater just before the water enters the receiving stream.  The chlorine is contained in metal cylinders which hold 2,000 lbs of chlorine, the maximum number of ton cylinders on site will be two during the required disinfection months of May---October.  The cylinders are housed in a separate building at the southeast corner of the plant.  The months of Nov---April no disinfection of the water is required and the plant will have below the threshold limit of chlorine (2,500lbs) on site.  A worst case scenario would involve a one ton cylinder being dropped during handling and rupturing causing the entire contents to spill onto the ground which would immediately start vaporizing.  The chlorine gas would form a cloud that would stay low to the ground and move with the wind.  If the wind was from the north-east the cloud would travel across the surface of the ground and across a ditch to a safe endpint three miles away.  The town is one mile from the plant in southerly direction, this spill would necessitate the evacuation of nearly 13,000 people. At this point the Emergency Response Plan would be set into motion.  An alternative release scenario would be a leak from a lead gasket between the container main valve and the chlorine pressure-regulating valve after a new container is connected. General accidental release prevention at the site include a warning system with a chlorine gas detector which is mounted on an adjacent wall according to specifications, in the chlorine building, and will activate an audible alarm at the site if chlorine gas is detected."

      "SummaryText": "A written policy on chlorine building entry as well as chlorine handling procedures are posted at the building site and/or at the main control building.  All connections and piping are checked on a regular basis.  Training is required of all employees on the handling of chlorine and the safety programs involved with chlorine.  There has been no accidental releases of chlorine at the wastewater plant up to the present time.  The emergency response program involves coordination with the Nobles County Emergency Operation Plan during a chlorine release.  The Nobles County Emergency Management Coordinator would direct required responses of the various units of government involved. The plant has a emergency plan on site for step by step procedures that must be taken depending on the severity (level one or two) of the release.  The improvement of the safety programs at the plant will be continually reviewed and any new control equipment will be looked at and evaluated.  Training will be an ongoing program involving personal protective equipment (PPE), classroom training and policy reviews."
