This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention programs and policies at our facility regarding items such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls for prevention of possible releases of hazardous substances.  If such a release should accidently occur at Frac 6,8 our responses are coordinated with authorities such as Mont Belvieu's Police & Fire Departments, and Mutual Aid Mont Belvieu (MAMB).\n\nThe Frac 6,8 plant involves activities related to extraction and fractionation of products from raw Y Grade feed. The Stationary Source consists of two units, Fractionator 6 and Fractionator 8 both capable of processing approximately 150,000 BPD each of Y Grade feed. Feedstock is delivered to Mont Belvieu via pipeline. Frac 6 and Frac 8 are designed to produce purity Ethane, Propane, N-Butane, Iso Butane, and Natural Gasoline Products.\n\nThe \"general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\" taken by Frac 6,8 were developed to be compliant with the accident release prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68. The following sections briefly describe elements of the release programs in place at the facility.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nFrac 6,8 maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nThe facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  Frac 6,8 uses a variety of widely recognized quantitative and qualitative process hazard and risk analysis methodologies such as \"Hazop\", \""

The studies are conducted by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations.  Studies are revalidated at a regular interval not to exceed 5 years.  Any findings brought to light by the hazard and risk analysis studies are to be managed and resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\nFrac 6,8 maintains written operating procedures to promote the safe conduct of activities for our covered processes. These procedures address various modes of operation such as startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is periodically reviewed and validated.  These procedures are readily accessible to operators involved in these processes.\n\nTraining\nFrac 6,8 provides comprehensive personnel training and testing programs to ensure employees who operate our processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every three (3) years, and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nIn order to ensure proper operations Frac 6,8 conducts documented maintenance review and checks on process equipment.  Examples of process equipment included in the preventative maintenance program includes, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, instrument controls, pumps, valves, gas detectors, flame detector, and temperature and pressure switches.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices with specialized training as needed.  Any equipment deficiencies identified through maintenance checks will be managed and resolved in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\nWritten procedures are in place at Frac 6,8 to manage changes in process chemicals, techn"

These reviews are in place to confirm construction, equipment assembly, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to introducing hazardous material and returning or placing equipment in operation.  \n\nCompliance Audits\nFrac 6,8 audits the RMP program on a scheduled basis in an effort to confirm provisions set out by the RMP rule are being properly and adequately implemented.  Comprehensive audits are to be conducted no less frequent than every three (3) years.  Any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are to be addressed in a safe and timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\nFrac 6,8 will promptly investigate any incident that results in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations will be conducted with the purpose of identification of the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence.  All reports are to be made available to the affected workforce and retained for a minimum of five (5) years.\n\nEmployee Participation\nEnergy Transfer Mont Belvieu Division Frac 6,8 management and personnel believe process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort and is committed to plant wide employee involvement and participation.   Company employees are encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.  In addition, our employees have access to information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses, audits and other.\n\nContractors\nOn occasion, Frac 6,8 hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.

Due to our stringent release prevention practices and policies no release of substance triggering the RMP accident reporting requirement has occurred.  During this period there have been no deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage from an RMP related incident.\n  \nEmergency Response Plan\nEnergy Transfer Frac 6,8 maintains a written emergency response plan dealing with contingencies from an accidental release of hazardous materials.   The emergency response plan includes first aid/medical treatment, evacuations, local emergency response agency and public notification, as well as post incident decontamination plans for affected areas. To ensure proper function, our emergency response equipment is regularly inspected, tested and serviced.  Drills are performed periodically to test plan response.  The emergency response plan is routinely reviewed for changes in our process or community.  Recognized significant change will be addressed and the plan revised to reflect emerging change and a modified emergency response.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nEnergy Transfer is committed to continuous safety improvement efforts.
