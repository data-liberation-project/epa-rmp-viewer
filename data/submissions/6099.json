The maximum process quantity is 96,000 lbs.,\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia gas is stored as a pressurized liquid in a single\n(1) tank located outdoors.  Maximum liquid ammonia inventory in each\ntank is 85% of the tank water volume of 20,000 gallons.  The ammonia\nvolume is converted to a mass of 97,000 lbs. by assuming an ammonia\ndensity of 42.5 lb/ft3.  The maximum process quantity is 97,000 lbs.,\nignoring negligible quantities in the piping.\n\n3    HAZARD ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Hazard Assessment has been completed for the RHWTP.  Offsite\nconsequence analysis modeling was performed based on the following\nprinciple elements:\n\nA.   Meteorological parameters for the dispersion modeling analysis\n     were determined using National Weather Service data collected at\n     the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.  Highest daily\n     maximum temperature and average relative humidity over the last\n     three-year period were used for worst-case scenarios.  Typical\n     meteorological conditions based on the data over the last \n     three-year period were used for alternative release scenarios.\n\nB.   Total quantity in the single largest tank was used for chlorine\n     and ammonia worst-case scenarios.  A leak from a liquid line near\n     the outdoor storage tank was assumed for either chlorine or\n     ammonia alternative release scenario.\n\nC.   No mitigation measure was considered in worst-case scenarios. \n     The excess flow valve, however, was considered for either\n     chlorine or ammonia alternative release scenario.\n\nD.   Distances to toxic endpoints for chlorine and ammonia worst-case\n     scenarios were modeled using a dense gas dispersion model,\n     DEGADIS.\n\nE.   Distances to the toxic endpoints for c"

Offsite impact was evaluated with LANDVIEW III for each release\n     scenario.\n\nThe accidental release of chlorine from a storage tank is considered\nthe worst-case scenario. A distance of 4.8 miles between the release\nsource and the toxic endpoint was modeled in the offsite consequence\nanalysis.  The alternative scenario impact distance is 1.2 miles for\nchlorine and 0.25 miles for ammonia.\n\nFor the worst-case scenario, LANDVIEW III estimated a population of\n150,000 persons within the worst-case scenario impact radius of 4.8\nmiles.  Populations are 6,900 and 0 persons for chlorine and ammonia\nalternative release scenarios, respectively.\n\nPublic receptors within the worst-case scenario impact area include\nschools, residences, hospitals, correctional facilities, recreation\nareas and commercial, office, or industrial areas.

Plant employees are limited\nto responding only to incidental releases covered by maintenance\nprocedures.  Appropriate procedures have been developed and are in\nplace that provide clear instructions on 1) how to determine if a leak\nis considered an incidental release, and 2) how to notify local\nemergency responders in the event of an uncontrolled release.  Current\nprocedures were reviewed and revised to meet regulatory requirements,\nsuch as emergency notification, evacuation, training, documentation,\navailability, etc., under 29 CFR 1910.38(a).  Regulated processes at\nthe RHWTP are not included in the community emergency response plan\ndeveloped under 42 U.S.C. 11003.  The local emergency responder is\nthe Emergency Management Office in association with the City of Fort\nWorth Fire Department.  Adequate safety information regarding\nregulated processes has been provided to the Emergency Management\nOffice who has developed and implemented specific emergency response\nplans, provided suitable training, and conducted necessary drills in\nemergency response for regulated chemical releases from regulated\nprocesses.
