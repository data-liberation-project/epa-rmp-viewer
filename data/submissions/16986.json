      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN\nThe E&J Gallo Livingston Winery is located at 18000 West River Road in Merced County, California.  The facility crushes grapes in order to produce wine and distilled spirits.  These products are stored prior to shipment to another Gallo facility for bottling and distribution.\n\nThe facility operates anhydrous ammonia refrigeration systems to provide product cooling.  Refrigeration systems have storage vessels (receivers) sized to contain all the liquid ammonia in the system, with additional capacity for thermal expansion. \n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system is a closed loop heat transfer system.  Ammonia moves through the system due to pressure differences produced by the compressors.  A brief description of the ammonia refrigeration cycle follows:\n\n1.  The receiver vessel stores liquid ammonia under pressure.  High pressure liquid ammonia flows from the receiver through liquid lines to the expansion valve, which partitions the pressure and temperature.  Liquid ammonia at reduced pressure and temperature is then piped into the chiller shell.  \n \n2. Product is circulated through sealed stainless steel tubing within the chiller shell.  Heat from the warm product transfers through the tubing walls to the cooler refrigerant, causing liquid refrigerant to boil off as low pressure vapor.  The rate of vaporization, and thereby the cooling of product, is determined by the amount of pressure in the chiller as controlled by a back pressure regulator, and suction from the compressors.\n \n3. The compressors draw the low pressure vapor from the chiller, compress it into high pressure vapor, and discharge to the evaporative condenser (cooling tower).\n \n4. In the evaporative condenser, ammonia vapor flows through tubing which is sprayed with water and located within fan driven air flow to promote cooling.  The ammonia vapor transfers heat through the tubing walls to the cooling water.  The ammonia condenses back to a liquid which drains by gra"

This is an unrealistic scenario and highly unlikely to ever occur.  Among other things, it does not take into account the plant's safety programs and specific operational and prevention programs.\n\nTOXIC ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIOS:  \nSulfur Dioxide - An alternative  release scenario would involve damage to piping due to contact from motorized equipment operating in the area.  If damage was sufficient to cause a failure, it could result in a 1 square inch opening.  The release of sulfur dioxide from the opening could be expelled into the air and onto surrounding surfaces.  Under more typical weather conditions (stability D, wind speed 4.5 meters per second)  the predicted distance to the 3 ppm toxic endpoint would be  2.8 miles from the source. \n \nAmmonia - An alternative release scenario would involve damage to liquid ammonia piping at a chiller due to contact from motorized equipment operating in the area.  If damage was sufficient to cause a failure, it could occur at a flange due to bolt failure, and result in a 1 square inch opening.  The release of liquid ammonia from the opening could be expelled into the air and onto surrounding surfaces.  Under more typical weather conditions (stability D, wind speed 4.5 meters per second)  the predicted distance to the 200 ppm toxic endpoint would be  0.51 mile from the source.   \n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nThe E&J Gallo Winery employs refrigeration mechanics, supported by Engineering.

Changes expected to have a significant safety effect on quantity, systems, or procedures will be referred to the appropriate Risk Management Program team for further study.  \n\nCOMPLIANCE AUDITS\nE&J Gallo Winery will perform an annual Risk Management Program compliance audit.  The specific items in the Risk Management Plan will be re-examined, and compliance documented.  The team reviewing these systems will consist of personnel from Engineering, Instrumentation, Maintenance, and Operations.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nHazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS) were performed for ammonia systems (in 1997), and sulfur dioxide systems (in 1995).  The study teams were composed of engineering, maintenance, and management personnel from E&J Gallo Winery.  As a result of the study, numerous improvements were made to existing systems, and included in major renewal and upgrade projects.  These improvements were completed prior to submission of this Risk Management Program document."
