Akzo Nobel has received accreditation from the International Standards Organization (ISO) for both a Quality Management System (ISO 9001) and an Environmental Management System (ISO 14001).  Both management systems allow for safety and environmental reviews to be performed before any requested process change can be made at our facility.\n\nIn August of 2002, our Pasadena facility was again designated a STAR site by OSHA under its Voluntary Protection Plan (VPP).  This was our second time being designated a STARsite by OSHA, which is the highest designation within the VPP program.  Akzo Nobel has undertaken this voluntary program to ensure that our facility's existing safety program meets or exceeds all of OSHA's safety requirements.  In addition to performing all of the program elements associated with the VPP program, the site continues to undergo periodic inspections by OSHA to ensure the continuation of our safety efforts.  Volunteering for OSHA's VPP program is yet another example of how the site has made a commitment in ensuring the highest degree of chemical, employee, and plant safety.   \n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS SUMMARY\n\nThe offsite consequences associated with both the worst case and alternate release scenarios have been removed from the Executive Summary pursuant to April 9, 2004 Federal Register.\n\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nAkzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals has not had any accidental releases of either allyl alcohol, 2-mehtyl-1-butene, or isopropyl chloroformate which required any of our employees to seek medical attention or resulted in any off-site impacts to be experienced.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nAkzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals is subject to various Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) emergency response program regulations.

The site also conducts four real-time emergency drills annually, with at least two of the exercises involving simulated hazardous material releases.  Akzo Nobel is a member of the Channel Industries Mutual Aid (CIMA) Association, and participates in an annual drill involving member CIMA companies.  Our site also undergoes periodic site inspections by CIMA to ensure our overall level of emergency response readiness.\n\nShould an emergency event ever occur onsite, the public would be informed of the event by a representative of Akzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals placing a recorded message on the local Community Awareness Emergency Response line (281-476-CAER or 281-476-2237).  The person with overall responsibility for coordinating our response to an onsite emergency (Incident Commander) has the responsibility of ensuring that all agency and community notifications are promptly made."

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION TO RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN (RMP) REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nAkzo Nobel Polymer Chemicals produces a variety of products at our Pasadena, Texas facility - an organic monomer for the lens manufacturing industry and organic peroxides for the plastic manufacturing industry.  Three of our organic chemical manufacturing processes use regulated chemicals above the RMP applicability threshold.  The organic monomer manufacturing process contains a diked allyl alcohol bulk storage tank (RMP toxic chemical).  One of our organic peroxide manufacturing processes contains a diked 2-methyl-1-butene bulk storage tank (RMP flammable chemical), while another one of our organic peroxide manufacturing processes utilizes a refrigerated building for drum storage of isopropyl chloroformate (RMP toxic chemical).\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION and EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nSenior management within Akzo Nobel is very committed to chemical, employee, and plant safety at our facility.  Their commitment is demonstrated by:\n\n     *   maintaining a staff of safety professionals onsite to properly manage all aspects of safety;\n     *   implementation of the Chemical Manufacturing Association's Responsible Care Initiative, which\n             requires member facilities to implement several different management codes of practices that\n             address various aspects of pollution prevention, process safety management, and site security;\n     *   annual reviews by senior management to verify the implementation and execution of CMA's\n             Responsible Care Initiative; \n     *   availability of corporate health & safety professionals for consultations;\n     *   encouraging active participation in both the Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC) and the\n             Channel lndustry Mutual Aid (CIMA) Emergency Response Association, which is the local emergency\n             response association that would respond to an emergency at our facility;\n     *   encourages active participa"

The Process Safety Management Standard, which is commonly referred to as PSM, requires subject facilities to perform specific accident prevention activities.   USEPA's Risk Management Plan (RMP) also requires applicable facilities to develop an accident prevention program; RMP essentially adopted all of PSM accident prevention program requirements as RMP program requirements.  The accident prevention program requirements that Akzo Nobel has implemented include:\n\n     *   Conduct comprehensive process hazard analyses to identify potential causes of accidents\n     *   Develop and maintain detailed operating procedures for all processes\n     *   Provide comprehensive employee training on subject processes\n     *   Periodically verify, through non-destructive testing, the integrity of key process components\n     *   Develop Management of Change written procedure for reviewing proposed process changes\n     *   Conduct pre-startup reviews whenever any qualifying modification is made to the subject process\n     *   Conduct PSM and RMP compliance audits every 3 years\n     *   Conduct incident investigations whenever an incident could have resulted in a catastrophic release\n     *   Employee participation in conducting process hazards analyses\n     *   Ensuring contractors are fully trained and periodic review of their performances\n\nSeveral different management systems have been developed to ensure that chemical, employee, and plant safety and environmental protection is a top"
