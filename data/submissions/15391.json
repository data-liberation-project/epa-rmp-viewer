In the event of a release, we are prepared to work with the local fire department and minimize the impact of the release on the employees, local residents, and the environment of the area.\n\n                    Ag Service Inc. is an ag retail business that sells fertilizer & chemical for use in crop production to local farmers.  The primary activity at the facility is the blending of ag fertilizer for use by local farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is purchased at our plant to be resold and then applied by our local farmers.\n\n                    The maximum amount that can be stored at our facility is 53000 lbs or approximately 10200 gallons anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum amount unloaded or present at our facility at any one time would be 53000 lbs. \n\n                     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes.  The maximum amount released would be 53000 lbs which it 85% of our storage tank capacity.  The distance to the endpoint is 1.63 miles with residential population within distance at approximately 100 people.\n\n                      The most likely potential release incident would be from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the endpoint is .83 miles with a residential population within distance of approximately 100 people.\n\n                      We have implemented and have posted at our anhydrous plant our emergency response guidelines for handling anhydrous ammonia.  These guidelines include responses in case of fire, spills or leaks, and first aid.  Employees have been trained in regards to all of these emergencies.  Ag Service has a written emergency ac"
