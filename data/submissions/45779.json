This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.  We also work closely with our public emergency responders providing them with training and equipment so that they can respond safely and efficiently to emergencies that might occur at our facility.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nThe East Carlsbad Gas Plant is a natural gas processing plant designed to process 25 MMCF per day through two process skids.  Approximately 18 MMSCF/D is processed through the cryogenic skid and the remainder goes through the QBJ Refrigeration unit. Operations are continuous 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  \n\nThe plant takes in, uses, and produces various streams.  The streams can be broken into broad categories of inputs, catalysts, chemicals, outputs, and waste streams.  Each of these categories may contain one or more materials.  The process also uses several utilities.\n\nThe East Carlsbad Gas Plant does not use, process or store a reportable quantity of toxic regulated substances.\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nFive-Year Accident History\n\nWithin the past five years the processes have had no accidental release that caused offsite impacts provided in the risk management program rule (40 CFR 68.10(b)(1)).\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the East Carlsbad Gas P"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the East Carlsbad Gas Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating.  The results and findings from these updates are documented. The team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the finding is documented.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe East Carlsbad Gas Plant maintains written procedures which address modes of process operations, i.e. (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures can be used as a reference by  experienced  operators, and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.
