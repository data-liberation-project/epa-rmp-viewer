The Memphis facility is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan.  \n\n\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers and co-ops.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n\n\n\nThe Helm Memphis facility stores and handles anhydrous ammonia and aqueous ammonia, which are subject to reporting under this filing to the EPA.  The facility receives anhydrous ammonia via barges and railcars, and the anhydrous ammonia is stored onsite in numerous storage vessels until it can be loaded into trucks for shipment.  In addition, the facility utilizes an aqua ammonia converter to add water to the anhydrous ammonia to create 19.5% and 29.4% aqueous ammonia, which is stored at the facility until it is loaded for shipment at a common loadout location. \n\n \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\n\nThe Helm Memphis facility has implemented the Program Level 3 prevention program requirements under the RMP regulations.

Additional details related to emergency procedures can be located in the facility's Emergency Action Plan.\n\n\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\n\nHelm is committed to continuous improvement and looks for opportunities to improve safety systems and programs at the facility.\n\n"
