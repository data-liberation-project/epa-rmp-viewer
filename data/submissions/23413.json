Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nWe at Brenntag Mid-South , Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is inherent to a comprehensive accidental release prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  Unforeseeably, if such a release does occur, we are completely coordinated with the HENDERSON FIRE DEPARTMENT which provides highly trained emergency response personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n\n2.    The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Distribution of chemical products.  We have 5 regulated substances present at our facility.  These substances include Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia.  Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide is received into Henderson in 180,000 pound railcars.  Anhydrous Ammonia is received into Henderson in 44,000 lb. tanktrucks. These product are then repackaged in different size containers for distribution to customers and in the manufacture of Sodium Hypchlorite, Sodium Bisulfite and Aqua Ammonia.  Hydrofluoric Acid is received prepackaged in different size containers.  Chlorine, Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia  is also used  for resell to our customers.\n\nThe maximum inventory of Chlorine at our facility is 794,550 lbs. while Sulfur dioxide (anhydrous), Hydrofluoric Acid, Anhydrous Ammonia and Aqua Ammonia  are present at our facility in quantities of 1,070,715 lbs., 121,680 lbs., 231,149 lbs.  and 242,131lbs.  respectively.\n\n\n3.

The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario submitted for Program  3 toxic substances as a class involves a catastrophic release from a 180,000 pound railcar of chlorine.  The scenario involves the release of 180,000 lb. of chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes.  Under worst case weather conditions, namely Class D atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 25 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  .0087 mg/L.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a release from a Ton CHLORINE CONTAINER STORAGE process.  The scenario involves the release of 2000 lb. of Chlorine in a gaseous form over 10 minutes. \n\nWith Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 1.5 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.5 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release scenario for Sulfur Dioxide (anhydrous) involves a release from a pipe  on the bottom outlet on the storage tank.  The scenario involves the release of 89,000 lb. of Sulfur Dioxide in a gaseous form over 60 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum distance of 1.9 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0078 mg/l. \n\nThe alternative release scenario for Hydroflouric Acid involves a release from a 350 gallon portable tank in storage.  The scenario involves the release of 3262 lb. of Hydrofluoric Acid  in a liquid form over 4.5 minutes. With Class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 6.7 m/sec the maximum distance of 0.44 miles is obtained corresponding to"

With class D atmospheric stability and windspeed of 3.0 m/sec the maximum  \ndistance of 0.2 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/l.\n\nThe alternative release for Anhydrous Ammonia involves a release from a transfer hose. The scenario involves the release of 51,234 lbs. of Anhydrous Ammonia in liquid form over 60 minutes. With class D atmospheric stability and windspeed  of  3 .0 m/sec the maximum distance of 1.40 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of  0.14 mg/l.\n\n\n\n4.    The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.

A number of processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of our release prevention program that are in place at our stationary source.\n \nProcess Safety Information\n\nBrenntag Mid-South, Inc. maintains a detailed  record of written safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is     \"WHAT IF\"  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of three years.
