      "SummaryText": "1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nMid-Freezer Warehouses Ltd. In Plymouth, FL  is committed to protecting its employees, the surrounding community and the environment from an accidental release of the anhydrous ammonia used in our refrigeration system. The release prevention program addresses such issues as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and training to ensure that releases do not occur.  Frequent inspections, regular maintenance, detectors, rigorous, supervised on-the-job training and 24 hour security/surveillance of the process reduce the liklihood of an acidental release.  If a release does occur, however, employees are trained to contain the spill from a safe distance and implement notification procedures.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the City of Apoka Fire Department, located less than a mile from the Facility and the Florida District 6 LEPC.\n\n2.  Regulated Substance\n\nThe facility is a cold and dry storage warehouse and anhydrous ammonia is used as a cooling media in a closed system.  There is approximately 39,500 pounds of ammonia within the system and it is the only regulated substance at the site that exceeds the threshold quantity.   Due to the amount of product and the location of public receptors, this facility is covered as a Level 3 facility under RMP regulations and also is subject to the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative-Release Scenario\n\nA variety of scenarios for both the worst-case and alternative case were calcualted using Risk*Comp  and LandView V software.  The worst case would be the release of the entire contents of a high pressure receiver (6000 lbs) over a 10 minute release period at a rate of 600 pounds per minute.  Under worst case weather conditions (Class F, 3.4 miles/hour windspeed) the distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L or 200 ppm, was .9 miles, affecting a population of 1343  .  There were severa"

There were no environmental receptors in the zone of influence. \n\nIn selecting the alternative-release scenario, all of the most likely events that would lead to the largest product release were calculated using the available data and Risk*Comp.   The event would be forklift collision with and damage/breakage of a 1 1/4 pipe containing pressurized liquid ammonia, in an outside area.  Under weather conditons of windspeed 6.7 miles/hour and atmospheric stability Class D, Risk*Comp calculated a release of  10,785 pounds at a release rate of 2157 pound per minute for five minutes which would make the distance to the toxic endpoint .3 miles, affecting a population of 155.  There were public receptors identified within the zone of influence, including churces, a recreation area and commerical/industrial areas.  There were no environmental receptors in the zone of influence.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThe facility has developed all prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accident Release Prevention requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 68 and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard. \n\nProcess Safety Information -  The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with all applicable state and industry codes.  Diagrams, drawings and written information has been prepared and maintained on site.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis - PHA was conducted, deficiencies identified and corrections implemented.  \n\nOperating procedures -  were developed and implemented for all activities relating to the process and prepared in accordance with OSHA and EPA guidelines.  They are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to remain consistent with the process.  \n\nTraining - Employees have extensive experience in operating and maintaining the process (25-35 years) and receive refresher training every 3 years or mor"

Thorough inspections, (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) are preformed and deviations or deficiencies corrected immediately.  Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMPs)  have been written for all maintenance and inspection activities and are reviewe annually to ensure that they are current.\n\nManagement of Change - There is a written management of change procedure in place.\n\nPre-startup Reviews - conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system or its components are opened for repairs, tie-ins or modifications.  A checklist has been developed (Based on IIAR bulletin 110) and used to ensure safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits - audits will be conducted every 3 years and corrective actions as a result of the audits implemented immediately.\n\nIncident Investigation - there is a program in place to promptly investigate any incident that resulted in, or had the potential for an accidental release of ammonia.  The process is designed to identify root causes and indicate preventative measures to prevent a reoccurrence.  The reports will be maintained on file for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation - Every employee at the facility has participated in all phases of the establishment of the Risk Managment Program.  Each is dedicated to the prevention of product releases and subsequent potential injuries to themselves, their coworkers, the surrounding community and the enviornment.\n\nContractors - A procedure for reviewing the safety performance and past safety history of any contractor hired to work on or with the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has been developed and will be adhered to.  The policy includes an obligation to inform the contractor of the hazards they and their workers will be exposed to as well as emergency response procedures.

Five-year Accident History - there have been no ammonia releases in the past five years.\n\n6.  Emergency Response Plan - In the event of a leak, employees with HazWOper Operations Level training would control the leak using defensive measures (shutting down valves) diking from a safe distance, and otherwise using measures from outside the danger zone.  The Apoka Fire Department would be contacted immediately and provide spill response.  If the leak were large, the facility would be evaucated.  We have coordianted our emergency response plan with The Florida District 6 LEPC and the City of Apoka Fire Department.\n\n7.

All deficiencies noted on audits, inspections and walk-thoughs will be corrected and recommendations based on PHAs implemented immediately."
