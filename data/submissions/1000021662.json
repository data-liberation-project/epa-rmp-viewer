The Chlorine is injected via vacuum with induction units using effluent to the head of the Chlorine Contact Basin.  We have only one tank (1 Ton Cylinder) hooked up to the process feeding approximately 20 lbs./day.  Chemical safety is of the utmost importance to this facility.  Safety measures are in use involving the handling and usage of chlorine and complying with all state and federal laws and regulations.  Employees are trained on Chemical Safety an the proper procedures to follow for change-outs, precautionary measures, use of Scott Air Paks and other safety devices at their disposal.  An Emergency Response Plan is in place and coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Service in the event of an accidental release.\n\nRegulated Substances Handled\n\nThe Franklin Wastewater Treatment Plant has not had any accidents at this facility during the \"Five Year History\".  It still holds true today that to my knowledge, there has never been an accidental release of chlorine at this facility since its construction in 1984.\n\nEmergency Response Plan\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan for the Wastewater Treatment Plant is based on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Division of Emergency Management's \"Tab Q-7\".  This plan is incorporated into the county's Emergency Response Plan for Simpson County by the LEPC.  This plan is periodically reviewed by the LEPC and updated by individual facilities.\n\nPlanned Safety Improvements\n\nWe continue to be very safety oriented and will continue to strive to improve safety measures at this facility.  The Franklin Wastewater Treatment Plant will continue to use safety audits, inspections, and safety meetings to focus on improving our operating procedures regarding the use of chlorine.\n\nIncluded in the ERP are truck routes used by the chlorine vendors that would be us"

Qualified personnel are on hand during loading and off-loading of Chlorine Cylinders.  The room used to house the Chlorine is in a separate building at the rear of the wastewater plant.   The building was constructed according to ten state standards.  Alarm systems are in place in the storage area plus additional alarms and analyzers located in the Administrative Building.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nIn a worst case scenario, chlorine gas would be released from the building using the model that was indicated under the \"Worst Case Scenario\" section of this RMP.  The total amount of chlorine that could be released under this scenario would be 2000 lbs.  We would certainly hope that through administrative controls, mitigation measures and participation with LEP in \"mock\" disasters that we would be prepared for such an accidental release.\n\nFive Year Accident History"
