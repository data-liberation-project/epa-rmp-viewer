Riverdale Chemical Company is committed to providing a safe, healthy and environmentally conscious work-place for its employees and neighbors.  Riverdale coordinates all of the emergency response activities with the Cook County LEPC, and Chicago Heights Fire Department.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled.   Riverdale manufacturers water-based herbicides consisting of one main process area where the herbicides are produced and a designated dimethylamine (DMA) tank location.  The herbicides are produced in batch processes.  Riverdale has 1 regulated substance, dimethylamine (DMA), at the facility.  The DMA is stored as a 60% (by weight) aqueous solution.  The maximum inventories of the regulated substance is summarized below:\n60 % DMA  - 44,000 pounds\n\nWorst case release scenario(s) and alternative release scenarios, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.  The RMP Rule requires the development of scenarios for the accidental release of toxic and flammable substances.  Riverdale reviewed Process Hazards Analysis, Environmental Release (RQ) Reports, Incident Reports, and Five Year Accident History to identify and model these release scenarios.  EPA's Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance dated May 24, 1996 was utilized to model the release scenarios.  Riverdale has identified one worst case scenario and several alternative case scenarios (only one is included in RMP Submit). \n\nThe flammable worst case scenario for the Riverdale facility involves the instantaneous failure of the DMA storage tank located on the south side of the site.  100% of the DMA inside the tanks is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to detonate.

There were no administrative controls or passive mitigation considered for this scenario.  \n\nThe flammable alternative case scenario for the Riverdale facility involves the catastophic failure of the DMA storage tank fill piping.  100% of the DMA inside the tanks is assumed to form a vapor cloud within the upper and lower flammability limits, and the cloud is assumed to detonate.  As a conservative assumption, 3 percent of the flammable vapor in the cloud is assumed to participate in the explosion.  This scenario results in off-site impacts to residences and industrial areas.  There were no administrative controls or passive mitigation considered for this scenario.  \n\nGeneral accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps. Riverdale has implemented programs to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements outlined by EPA. \n\nProcess Safety Information\nRiverdale maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information.  This includes information pertaining to hazards of regulated substances, the technology of the process and the equipment in the process.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\nRiverdale has performed initial process hazard analysis to comply with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) and these hazard analysis apply to processes covered by RMP.  The Riverdale Site utilizes the What-if Method to identify hazards of the process, to identify previous incidents that may result in a release of a regulated substance, to ensure proper detection systems are in place, to consider consequences of failure of administrative and engineering controls, to identify human factors that may contribute to the release of a regulated substance and to evaluate safety and health effects of possible releases of regulated substances.\n\nOperating Procedures\nRiverdale has writte"

Training documentation provides records of when training was received and whether or not the training was understood.\n\nMechanical Integrity\nRiverdale has written procedures for maintaining the mechanical integrity of process equipment.  Maintenance employees receive training for maintenance activities.  Periodic inspection and testing are performed on process equipment, and records are kept to document this inspection and testing.\n\nManagement of Change\nRiverdale has a written procedure established to document and manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures.  Employees are notified of and provided training for changes to the process.\n\nPre-Startup Review\nRiverdale performs pre-startup reviews for changes in a process that require modification to process safety information.\n\nCompliance Audit\nRiverdale will evaluate compliance with the provisions of 40 CFR part 68 every three years.\n\nIncident Investigation\nRiverdale conducts an incident investigation for every incident that resulted in or could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.\n\nEmployee Participation\nRiverdale has a written employee participation plan that allows input from employees on the development and analysis of process safety management.  PHA's and all other RMP information are available to employees.\n\nHot Work Permit\nRiverdale has a procedure for the issuance of hot work permits for hot work done on a covered process.\n\nContractors\nRiverdale hires contractors to perform maintenance and various other activities at their facility.
