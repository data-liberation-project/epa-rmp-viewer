      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary\nIntroduction \nChemicals are widely used in industry, in the home, and in the environment.  They are transported on roads, water, and railways.  The Minneapolis Water Works\u00c2\u00bf (MWW) Fridley Complex stores chemicals that it uses in its daily operations. The Fridley Complex includes the Fridley Filter Plant (FFP), which uses chlorine stored in up to two 90-ton railroad tank cars and up to fifteen 1-ton containers, and the Fridley Chemical Building (FCB), which uses chlorine stored in up to 84 1-ton containers.    The FFP also stores anhydrous ammonia stored in 6,000-gallon and 1,000-gallon bulk storage tanks.  Chlorine and ammonia are used at the FFP and FCB to disinfect treated water prior to distribution to customers in Minneapolis and surrounding communities.  The natural world contains more that 1,500 chlorine-containing compounds.  Chlorine is also used to disinfect wastewater, disinfect our swimming pools and protect human health through the destruction of disease-causing organisms. The World Health Organization estimates that 25,000 children who die daily could be saved through the use of an effective water disinfection agent such as chlorine.\nChlorine and ammonia are non-explosive and non-flammable. However, they support combustion under some circumstances.  They are both respiratory irritants, and exposure through inhalation or eye or skin contact can pose a health risk.  As a precaution, the FFP and FCB have special safety systems that are an integral part of the chlorine and ammonia systems.\nWe take our safety obligations in storing and using chemicals as seriously as we take providing the community with safe purified drinking water.  The following document describes the steps we take everyday to ensure a safely operating plant, what could happen if there was an accidental release of a chemical stored on site, and what to do in the event of an emergency.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nThis document complies w"

The Risk Management Program requires facilities that use certain substances above certain quantity thresholds to develop a plan to reduce the likelihood of an accidental release of the substances to the atmosphere and reduce the likelihood of serious harm to the public and the environment. This plan is referred to as the Risk Management Plan (RMP).\nChlorine and ammonia are stored in quantities at the FFP and FCB above the regulatory thresholds at which a RMP is required.  This RMP document summarizes our existing safety systems, policies, procedures, and on-going actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine or ammonia to the environment. \nThe Fridley Complex has a detailed and comprehensive emergency response plan to handle accidental releases.  In addition, MWW staff were closely involved in the formation of the Fridley Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) unit in 1993.  The group has since expanded to include several surrounding communities and is now referred to as North Metro CAER unit.  The purpose of CAER is to integrate existing emergency response plans and procedures of local industry and the public safety organization.  The North Metro CAER unit includes the Fridley Complex and the Fridley Fire Department.  The organization maintains updated emergency databases, plans drills and special events, develops training programs, and shares information to improve response procedures.  \nThe Fridley Complex has been handling chemicals since 1925.  To date, no chlorine or ammonia releases causing a safety or health hazard affecting the surrounding community have occurred. Minor releases that have occurred at the plant have been safely remedied using existing emergency response procedures and techniques.   \nU"

      "SummaryText": "nderstanding the Chemicals Used at the Fridley Complex\nThe Fridley Complex, operating since 1925, is located at 4300 Marshall Street NE in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Raw water supplied from the Mississippi River is treated at the Fridley Softening Plant and the FFP, and treated water is distributed to customers in Minneapolis and the surrounding communities.  The water treatment process includes screening, softening, coagulation, filtration, and disinfection.  The MWW produces an average of approximately 70 million gallons of water per day from all of their treatment plants.  The FFP and FCB have chlorination systems that use chlorine gas fed from liquid chlorine storage containers and the FFP has an anhydrous ammonia system that uses ammonia gas fed from liquid anhydrous ammonia storage containers.\nThe railroad tank cars containing chlorine are delivered to the FFP by rail.  Chlorine is also stored in 1-ton containers at the FFP and FCB.  Liquid or gaseous chlorine is withdrawn directly from the rail car or 1-ton containers and delivered to the disinfection process.  Liquid ammonia is brought to the plant by the chemical supplier and is transferred to the bulk storage tanks.  Liquid or gaseous ammonia is also withdrawn from the bulk storage tanks and delivered to the disinfection process.  The FFP and FCB use state-of-the-art equipment to maximize the safety for plant staff and the community at large.  Some of the specific features are as follows.  Chlorine and ammonia leak detectors continuously monitor for leaks in the bulk storage areas and in the chlorine and ammonia process areas.  Leak alarms activate an audible alarm throughout the plant and the alarms sound at the central and local control panels. \nOther alarms on the chlorine system include high pressure in liquid piping, evaporator malfunction, low vacuum at the chlorinator, and low injector water pressure.  These alarms sound at the chlorine central and local control panels.  Process related factory-set pr"

Pressure relief valve discharges are continuously monitored by leak detectors that sound an alarm when activated.  Chlorine rail cars include automatic shutoff valves.  The rail car discharge valve will automatically close in response to a leak alarm, a sudden loss in line pressure, or a power outage.  1-ton containers at the FCB include automatic shutoff valves that will automatically close in response to a leak alarm or fire alarm.\nThe chlorine and ammonia process rooms are enclosed in a building and the process areas are equipped with ventilation systems.  The chlorine process area includes an automatic ventilation system that operates when the chlorine leak detector detects chlorine in the room.  The FCB emergency ventilation system activates a scrubber when chlorine is detected in the room.  The scrubber neutralizes the chlorine gas and discharges treated air to the atmosphere.  The scrubber is sized to treat the entire contents of one 1-ton chlorine container.\nThe Fridley Complex is surrounded by a fence and access to the plant is controlled. A surveillance camera is provided in the chlorine rail car area that is monitored by plant operators at the operator workstation. The plant is staffed 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. \nRMP Requirements\nThe RMP consists of three major parts. The first part is the Hazard Assessment. The Hazard Assessment is done to determine the potential effects that a release of a regulated substance could have on the public surrounding the facility. The second part is a Prevention Program that consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release. The third part is the Emergency Response Program, which develops a plan for dealing with a release in the unlikely event that one would occur. Because the regulations are very similar, the Prevention Program and the Emergency Response Program also serve as the OSHA P"

The Hazard Assessment considers two release scenarios\u00c2\u00bfa \u00c2\u00bfworst case\u00c2\u00bf and an \u00c2\u00bfalternative case.\u00c2\u00bf  The results of the Hazard Assessment are reported to EPA.\nPrevention Program\nThe Prevention Program consists of 12 elements designed to improve the system safety and decrease the likelihood of a release.\nEmployee Participation \nThe participation of the MWW staff in preparing the RMP/PSM program was critical to the program\u00c2\u00bfs successful implementation. Employee participation is valuable because it increases the safety awareness of the staff and it allows the staff\u00c2\u00bfs experience in operating and maintaining the processes to be incorporated into the plan.\nPlant staff participated in the development of the Prevention Program through a series of meetings and workshops. Another way that the MWW staff participated in the development of the RMP/PSM was the Process Hazard Analysis that is described below.  \nProcess Safety Information\nThe RMP/PSM regulations require that information concerning process chemicals, technology, and equipment be compiled as part of the RMP program. Emergency response planners can use such information to develop training programs and procedures, or as a general resource. The information is also supplied to contractors who will work in the chlorine and ammonia process areas as part of the requirements outlined in the Contractors element of this program.

This information was used by plant staff to improve safety and reduce the likelihood and potential consequences of an accidental release. Equipment, instrumentation, utilities, human actions, and external factors that might affect the process were the focus of the PHAs that were performed for the chlorine and ammonia processes.\nThe chlorine and ammonia PHAs were conducted by an interdisciplinary team of plant staff familiar with process operation and maintenance. The PHA was done using a combination of \u00c2\u00bfWhat-If\u00c2\u00bf and \u00c2\u00bfChecklist\u00c2\u00bf methods. Based on the results of the PHAs, numerous changes in operating, maintenance, and other process safety management procedures that would improve the overall safety of the plant were identified. Several changes have been adopted by the plant and incorporated as part of the overall RMP/PSM program. Other improvements and process modifications to reduce or eliminate potential hazards are scheduled to be implemented or incorporated.\nOperating Procedures\nOperating procedures for the chlorine and ammonia processes have been developed as part of the RPM/PSM plan. Written operating procedures assure continuous, efficient, and safe operation of the facility. The goal of the operating procedures is to provide clear instructions to safely operate the process. Operating procedures are also used to train new employees and to provide refresher training for existing staff.\nTraining\nAn effective RMP/PSM training program can significantly reduce the potential for accidental release incidents.

The mechanical integrity program also addresses equipment testing and inspection, preventative maintenance schedules, and personnel training. The intent is to ensure that equipment used to process, store, or handle chlorine and ammonia is maintained and installed to minimize the risk of releases.\nThe plant maintenance staff schedule preventative maintenance (PM), provide safety procedures for work orders, and maintain an inventory of parts and materials. In addition to preventative maintenance, the plant staff performs corrective maintenance in the event of equipment malfunction or breakdown. The staff that perform maintenance tasks are all trained as part of the RMP/PSM program.\nHot Works Permits\nRMP/PSM regulations require employees and contractors to employ safe work practices when performing \u00c2\u00bfhot work\u00c2\u00bf in, on, or around the chlorine or ammonia processes.

The intent is to require that all modifications to equipment, procedures, and processing conditions other than \u00c2\u00bfreplacement in kind\u00c2\u00bf be managed by identifying and reviewing them before implementation. A Management of Change Committee that consists of plant engineering, operations, and/or maintenance staff is formed to evaluate any modifications that are covered under the RMP/PSM. The committee will complete a Management of Change Form that must be reviewed and authorized prior to initiation of a covered change.\nIncident Investigation\nEach incident that resulted in or could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release of chlorine or ammonia must be investigated. A process to identify the underlying causes of incidents and to implement procedures for preventing similar events has been developed. To investigate an incident, facility management will establish an investigation team. As part of the investigation, the investigation team will prepare an incident report to recommend system changes.\nCompliance Audit\nThe plant is required to complete a compliance audit for the RMP/PSM program.
