These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards, and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs). \r\n\r\nHAZARD REVIEW\r\n\r\nHazard Reviews are conducted on a periodic basis. The review teams consists of engineering, maintenance, operations, safety, and environmental personnel, as well as a team leader and design engineers provided by contractors.  The process hazard analysis method chosen for evaluating the ammonia system was a HazOp.  During the HazOp analysis, the design intent and conditions for each major piece of equipment were identified.  Guide words and potential deviations were postulated for each system.  Recommendations for improved safety are recorded with a schedule to incorporate the change in the timely fashion.  \r\n\r\nMercer Generating Station has written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators.  These procedures will be periodically reviewed and certified as current and accurate. \r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, PSEG Fossil has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees i"

Maintenance personnel have received training on (1) an overview of the process, (2) safety and health hazards, (3) applicable maintenance procedures, (4) emergency response plans, and (5) applicable safe work practices to help ensure they can perform jobs in a safe manner.  Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment is functioning properly.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\r\n\r\nPSEG Fossil has no accidents in the past 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\r\n\r\nPSEG Fossil maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.

This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of processes.  PSEG Fossil's policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThe PSEG Fossil - Mercer Generating Station is located on Lamberton Road in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey.  Mercer Generating Station has one regulated toxic substance, aqueous ammonia.  The concentration of ammonia within the solution is between 29.4% and 29.8% by weight.  Aqueous ammonia is utilized as an integral component of the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system on Units No. 1 and 2 to reduce Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions.\r\n\r\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFor Mercer Generating Station, the potential worst-case toxic release scenario involves the entire contents of one aqueous ammonia storage tank.  The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RMP*Comp model was used to determine that the distance to toxic endpoint for such a release remains within the property boundary and, therefore, does not affect any public or environmental receptors.  The storage facility is equipped with a secondary containment and an underground concrete vault to contain spills.  The vault is designed to mitigate accidental spills and to provide safety for employees and the community. \r\n\r\nThe alternative release scenario analyzed was a break in the transfer hose from a tank truck during the aqueous ammonia unloading.  Also using RMP*Comp, the distance to toxic endpoint remains within the property boundary and, therefore, does not affect any public or env"
