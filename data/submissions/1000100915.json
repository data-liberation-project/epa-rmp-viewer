This summary is presented in response to the requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 68 (40 CFR 68) and Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act. The PGP ethanol facility is subject to the RMP rule due to the storage of natural gasoline (denaturant), a regulated flammable mixture, above the respective threshold quantity. This RMP submittal is to meet the five (5) year submission requirements of the EPA Title 40 Part 68 requirements for the facility.\r\n\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies [68.155(a)]\r\n \r\nPGP is committed to protecting the environment and operating facility in a manner that promotes the safety of employees and the general public. Management has adopted and implemented policies that adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. The design and construction of the facility has incorporated physical and operational safeguards to prevent accidental releases. Through the proper design, installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment, and the training of our personnel, PGP has minimized the hazard to human health and the environment from fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous materials.  \r\n\r\nIn the event that a release does occur, the facility's emergency response actions are described in its Emergency Action Plan (EAP). The EAP includes procedures to coordinate response actions with local emergency response personnel (i.e., law enforcement, fire, and rescue departments, emergency medical services, hospital and government personnel, etc.) as well as any potentially affected neighbors. In addition, the EAP is used to familiarize local emergency response personnel with the t"

Ethanol is produced through the conversion of corn starch to sugars and then conversion of the sugars to ethanol (i.e., grain alcohol) through a fermentation and continuous distillation process. \r\n\r\nRegulated substances stored at the facility include natural gasoline which is used as a denaturant in the ethanol fuel product.\r\n\r\n3.\tAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps [68.155(c)]\r\n\r\nPGP has programs in place to address accidental release prevention measures required by EPA, Process Safety Management (PSM) requirements from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and notification requirements of EPA's Emergency Response and Community Right-to-Know regulations. The facility complies with PSM for the management of ethanol and natural gasoline (denaturant).\r\n\r\nEmployee Participation\r\n\r\nPGP has developed an employee participation program. All process safety information, process hazard analysis (PHA) results, recommendations, action items, incident investigations, compliance audits, operating procedures, emergency response plan, and records of management of change are available to the operating personnel at any time.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis and Process Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe facility utilizes the HAZOP (Hazard Operability Study) PHA methodology. The PHA identified the following potential major hazards: fire, explosion, over-pressurization, corrosion, over-filling and equipment failure. The facility utilizes process controls such as vents, check valves, manual shutoffs, automatic shutoffs, interlocks, alarms and procedures, and grounding equipment to prevent or limit releases.  \r\n\r\nPGP maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain sa"

Chemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in Safety Data Sheets (SDSs). The facility also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical rating of equipment, and piping and instrumentation drawings.\r\n\r\nOperating Procedures and Training\r\n\r\nPGP maintains written procedures that address the various modes of process operations, including operations and emergency shutdown. The facility has developed and implemented a training program for all employees involved in facility operations.  \r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe contractor safety procedures establish minimum guidelines and activities in order to assure that the contractor's employees follow safe work practices and procedures. The procedure includes a contractor screening process and hazard awareness, safety and emergency procedures training. All contractors performing work on or near a covered process is required to undergo Contractor Prequalification prior to acceptance as a qualified contractor to perform work at the facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews\r\n\r\nPGP performs a Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and the equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.\r\n\r\nMechanical Integrity\r\n\r\nThe facility's mechanical integrity program includes task and testing schedules, equipment design and installation information, and regular inspections and equipment testing procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, pumps, emergency shutdown systems, and controls in a safe operating condition.  \r\n\r\nManagement o"

Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards, and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by a process change.  \r\n\r\nIncident Investigation\r\n\r\nPGP has procedures to promptly investigate any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a release of an RMP regulated substance. The procedure establishes the minimum guidelines and activities of the incident investigation program in order to reduce the likelihood of repetitive occurrences of events which could reasonably lead to catastrophic releases. Investigations will be undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent a similar release in the future.\r\n\r\nCompliance Audits\r\n\r\nThe facility performs regular compliance audits of the provisions of RMP to verify that procedures and practices developed under the standard are adequate and are being followed.
