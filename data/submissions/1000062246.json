The Carbon Dioxide is purified, compressed and refrigerated into liquid form and the liquid Carbon dioxide is stored under pressure as a refrigerated liquid.  The facility also manufactures and processes various forms of solid Carbon Dioxide (dry ice).  Ammonia is used as the refrigerant in an Ammonia refrigeration system located on the facility.  An ammonia receiver stores the Ammonia refrigerant  in addition to various heat exchangers, compressors, condensers and connecting piping and valves.\n\n\n\nOur worst case scenario for ammonia system is a failure of the ammonia receiver resulting in the release of ammonia.The quantity of the release is estimated to be 18,000lb of ammonia over a 10 minute period of time with most stable of atmospheric conditions which minimizes dispersion of a release and thus the worst case of quantity released and worst case due to atmospheric conditions.  The calculated toxic endpoint of which the concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 1.7 miles.  These calculations were based on the EPA's \"Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  Public receptors identified within 1.7 miles of the facility include residences, schools, recreational areas and commercial/industrial areas.\n\n\n\nAn alternate release scenario was also calculated using EPA guidelines.  A leak from a pipe, pump or vessel was assumed to create a release rate of 180lb per minute.  The atmospheric condition are assumed to be more typical of the area and the toxic endpoint of which the ammonia concentration is calculated not to exceed 200ppm is 580ft (0.1 miles).  Again, calculations were based  on the EPA's \"Risk Management Guidelines fro Ammonia Refrigeration.\"  Public receptors  within 0.1 miles of the facility include commercial/industrial facilities.\n\n\n\nThis facility complies with the EPA's accidental release preve"

In addition, this facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management  Program. Our comprehensive prevention program includes documented  process safety information  to ensure safe and reliable plant operation, process hazard analysis to identify and train all effected employees in the hazards associated with the operation of an ammonia refrigeration system, mechanical integrity procedures to ensure adequate and proper plant maintenance.  Should an accident or near miss occur, procedures are in place to thoroughly investigate the incident and take corrective action as necessary. We believe the key to preventing incidents is continuously improving our operating and prevention procedures and better educating our employees.\n\n\n\nThis is a relatively new facility with all refrigeration components being made within ASME and ASHRAE specifications.The system is also to be thoroughly inspected and tested on an annual basis.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an Ammonia release, the plant has developed  an emergency response plan and procedure.  If necessary, the Sheridan Township Fire Department  will be contacted and emergency response procedures  will be coordinated with the Sheridan Township Fire Department and the Calhoun Co. LEPC and any other local authorities in order to most effectively  protect our employees, our property and our community."
