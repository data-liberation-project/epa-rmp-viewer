This commitment is an inherent part of our comprehensive accidental\nrelease prevention program in place that covers areas such as design, installation, operating\nprocedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is\nour policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. \nUnforeseeably, if such a release does occur, our trained emergency response personnel are at hand\nto control and mitigate the effects of the release.    We are also coordinated with Thief River Falls\nFire Department which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n  2.

The Worst Case Release Scenario and the Alternative Release Scenarios\nTo perform the required offsite consequence analysis for our facility, we utilized RMP Comp \nprovided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The following paragraphs provide details\nof the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario involves a catastrophic release of the entire contents of the\nanhydrous ammonia storage tank (120416 lbs.) in gaseous form over 10 minutes.   At Class F\natmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 5.0 miles is obtained\ncorresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.14 mg/L (Figure 2).\n\nThe alternative release scenario involves a release from a anh"
