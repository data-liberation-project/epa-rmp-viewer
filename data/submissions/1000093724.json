The same properties that make Chlorine valuable as a water treatment chemical also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling the material.\n\n\n\nThe prevention of unnecessary human exposure reduces the threat to the health and safety of employees as well as nearby members of the community.  The primary goal of this Risk Management Plan is to ensure the safety of the employees of this facility and all residents that may be impacted by a release from this facility.\n\n\n\nIt is the policy of the City of Nashville to adhere to all applicable federal and state rules and regulations. Safety depends upon the manner in which Chlorine is handled, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, and the training of the personnel.\n\n\n\nThe Risk Management Program, including the Emergeny Response Program, was developed with the assistance of Gibson Consulting, LLC and NRS Consulting Engineers, Inc. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notification of the appropriate agencies and potentially affected members of the community. In addition,I provides  procedures for mitigating any  releases that may cause harm  to the community.\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of this facility is to produce treated water by utilizing the regulated chemical Chlorine.  The maximum amount of Chlorine stored at this plan is 8,000 pounds.  Chlorine is received in individual one-tone cylinders and store until needed. Chlorine is injected into the water system by automatic feeders. The feed system uses a vacuum \"shut-off\"system which is designed to automatically shut the system down if a leak occurs.\n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, authorized management personnel and authorized contractors.\n\n\n\nA worst-case scenario for this facility involves the failure of and total release from the largest storage tank when filled to capacity, resulting"

      "SummaryText": " in a release of 2,000 pounds of Chlorine. When Chlorine is released into the air, it creates a hazard. Therefore, the worst-case scenario has been used. Active mitigation has been considered for this scenario. The Chlorine storage tanks are located in the Chlorine Cylinder Room with is constructed of a CMU wall on three sides and one side with double fiberglass doors. It is assumed that theentire contents are released as a vapor.  The distance to the endpoint of 0.0087 mg/l for the worst-case scenario is 2.6 miles.\n\n\n\nAn alternative scenario has  been developed for this facility.  The alternative scenario is based on the type of prevention system in place, and the release should  be minimal. The vacuum \"shut-off\" system has been determined to be effective in preventing greatger than small amounts of Chlorine from being released.  Estimations based on the line capacity for the feeder lines would be approximately 10 pounds released into the atmosphere.  The amount of Chlorine vapor released would result in a distance to end point of approximately 0.48 of a mile.  \n\n\n\nThis water treatment plant complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable State of Arkansas codes and regulations.\n\n\n\nThere have been no accidental releases of Chlorine in the last five years.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Program was developed for the City of Nashville and the surrounding areas with the assistance of NRS Consulting Engineers.  This program has been discussed with the Arkansas Office of Emergency Preparedness and the Nashville Fire Department. \n\n\n\nThe Chlorine feed system was upgraded at this facility in 2005 and meet all desigh requirements for and complies with all applicable regulations for water treatment facilities.\n\n"
