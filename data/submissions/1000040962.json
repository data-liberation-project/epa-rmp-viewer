              "Description": "The alkylated formaldehyde resins process is a batch process carried out in a jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor).  The reactor can be oil-cooled or heated to control the reaction rate and temperature.  The reactor is equipped with overhead reflux condensers to condense the unreacted overhead vapors and to return them to the reactor.  The condenser is also used to control the temperature of the reaction by condensing water.  The reactor is equipped with safety relief devices, either safety relief valves or rupture discs or both, to prevent overpressurization of the reactor that could cause a catastrophic release of toxic chemicals.  The reactors are vented to the plant absorber systems or flare (or both) to minimize the release of toxic chemicals to the atmosphere when loading or depressurizing the reactor.\n\n\n\nThe listed chemical for this process is a formaldehyde (50 percent) in water solution (i.e., formalin).  The largest quantity of this chemical onsite is in an aboveground storage tank.  The formalin storage tank is a stainless steel resin, vertical, atmospheric storage tank vented through a scrubber.  The tank and piping are visually inspected for corrosion on an annual basis.  Because this tank is an atmospheric tank and the formalin vapor pressure is low, there is virtually no chance of overpressurization and catastrophic failure of this tank.  The formalin in the storage tank is replenished by tank truck deliveries.\n\n\n\nFormalin deliveries are scheduled on an as needed basis to prevent overfilling the tank.  The formalin is transferred by pipe from the storage tank to the reactor.  Check valves are installed in the piping to prevent backflow and possible contamination of the storage tank or overflow from the tank.  The formalin feed rate is controlled to stabilize the reaction, temperature, and pressure in the reactor.  The formalin tank is periodically inspected for corrosion and wall thickness by an outside contractor to ensure tank integrity.  A maintenance program is in place to inspect the piping, pumps, reactor, and process vessels and to promptly make appropriate repairs if a problem is discovered.\n\n\n\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of formaldehyde.  They are also required to attend monthly safety meeting.  The operators and supervisors are instructed in the following areas:  a) overview of RCRA rules and regulations; b) emergency response and spill prevention; c) Right-to-Know Laws; d) use of safety equipment; e) job-specific training; f) chemical safety training; g) respiratory protection; and h) confined space entry procedures.  A file of safety data sheets (SDS) are readily available for the employees and the public at the site.  ",

              "Description": "The two regulated chemicals for this process are ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO).  The oxyalkylated products process is a batch process carried out in a jacketed, stirred tank, pressure vessel (reactor).  The reactor is protected from a catastrophic failure caused by over pressurization by the installed safety relief devices.  The reactor pressure is also managed by the controlled addition of EO or PO and by the reactor cooling jacket.  The reactors are vented through a vent condenser to a flare to minimize emissions of EO and PO to the atmosphere.  The flare destruction efficiency is greater than 98 percent.\n\n\n\nThe largest quantity of EO and PO onsite are located in the respective storage vessels.  These storage tanks are horizontal pressure vessels rated at 150 psig.  They are equipped with safety relief devices to prevent a catastrophic release of EO or PO as a result of tank over pressurization.  The EO and PO in the tanks are blanketed with nitrogen to prevent an explosive atmosphere in the tanks.  The nitrogen pressure does not exceed 75 psig, which is well below the 150 psig pressure rating of the tanks.  No-leak design, canned pumps are used to transfer the EO and PO from railcars to the bulk storage tanks.  EO and PO are transferred between storage tanks and to the reactors using double sealed centrifugal pumps.  The transfer lines contain check valves that inhibit reverse flow from the reactor to the storage tanks to prevent contamination and/or over pressurization of the storage tanks.  The storage tanks and piping are periodically inspected for thickness and corrosion by an outside contractor to ensure mechanical integrity.\n\n\n\nThe EO and PO storage tanks are loaded by railroad tank car.  A system is used to recycle vapors from the storage tank to the railcar while the liquid EO or PO is pumped into the storage tank.  This system prevents venting of EO or PO to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of EO and PO.  They are also required to attend monthly safety meeting.  The operators and supervisors are instructed in the following areas:  a) overview of RCRA rules and regulations; b) emergency response and spill prevention; c) Right-to-Know Laws; d) use of safety equipment; e) job-specific training; f) chemical safety training; g) respiratory protection; and h) confined space entry procedures.  A file of safety data sheets (SDS) are readily available for the employees and the public at the site.",

              "Description": "The esterification process is a batch process utilizing a jacketed, stirred tank, pressurized vessel (reactor).  All safety devices described on the other batch reactors also apply to this reaction system.  Safety relief devices protect the reactors from catastrophic failure caused by over pressurization.  These reactors vent through a condenser to an acid/base absorber/scrubber system and a final activated carbon bed or the flare to minimize harmful emissions to the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe regulated chemicals for this process are anhydrous ammonia and acetaldehyde.  The largest quantity of ammonia onsite is contained in a horizontal 250 psig pressure rated storage tank.  The acetaldehyde is received in a trailer tank.  The trailer tank contains enough acetaldehyde for 24 batch reactor runs and is removed from the site at the completion of the production run, which lasts approximately two and one-half hours. A maximum of two batches are made per week, with a maximum of 24 runs per year.  Acetaldehyde is not stored onsite.  The trailer tank is DOT rated and inspected for the safe transportation and storage of acetaldehyde.  Both the trailer tank and ammonia storage tank are protected by safety relief devices to prevent rupture by over pressurization.  When onsite, the acetaldehyde trailer is within ten feet of the batch reactor.  Excess acetaldehyde is vented through the reactor to the flare via the plant scrubber system.  The trailer tank has an excess flow valve.  The ammonia storage tank is loaded from a delivery tank truck using a closed, vapor recycle system to prevent ammonia emissions to the atmosphere.  The ammonia tank also has an excess flow valve that will shut down the flow of ammonia within one minute, in the event of a line leak or excessive flow to the reactor.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia tank is periodically inspected for corrosion and wall thickness by an outside contractor to ensure tank integrity.  A maintenance plan is enforced to maintain mechanical integrity of the process. \n\n\n\nAll operators and supervisors are trained in the safe handling of anhydrous ammonia and acetaldehyde.  They are also required to attend monthly safety meeting.  The operators and supervisors are instructed in the following areas:  a) overview of RCRA rules and regulations; b) emergency response and spill prevention; c) Right-to-Know Laws; d) use of safety equipment; e) job-specific training; f) chemical safety training; g) respiratory protection; and h) confined space entry procedures.

Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe safety of employees, company operations, and the public are facility management's most important objectives. The Nalco Champion Safety Policy states that the company is committed to providing the processes, facilities, standard training, discipline and work culture to ensure a safe work environment for all employees, safety for the communities in which we operate, safe competitive products for our customers and protection of shareholder assets. The Fresno Facility has developed a comprehensive operational program designed to minimize the potential for accidental releases and to facilitate effective response to accidental releases which includes protection of the public.\n\n\n\n2. The Stationary Source and the Regulatory Substances Handled\n\nThe Nalco Champion facility - located at 3130 FM 521 in Fresno, TX - is comprised of a manufacturing plant and global technology center.  The manufacturing plant, which is the primary operation at the facility, utilizes batch chemical processing to produce industrial organic chemical products that are used primarily in the oil and gas industry.  The plant is further divided into four smaller plants (each consisting of reactors and/or blenders) that utilize common auxiliary equipment and utilities. The plant is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round and full time security personnel are present at the facility. \n\n\n\nRaw materials, including intermediates, are brought into the plant in containers (super-sacks, bags, totes, or drums), railcars, and tank-trucks. These materials are then transferred into storage tanks or warehoused until needed for product manufacture. The following six RMP-regulated substances are present as raw materials:\n\nAnhydrous Ammonia (NH3) - Toxic regulated\n\nEthylene Oxide (EO) - Toxic regulated\n\nFormaldehyde (37% Solution) - Toxic regulated\n\nFormaldehyde (50% Solution) - Tox"

Raw materials charged into a reactor undergo any combination of mixing, temperature, and/or pressure changes to form the desired product. Those raw materials charged to a blender do not undergo forced temperature or pressure changes to make a product.\n\n\n\nRaw material charging to a vessel is performed using various methods. Raw materials in storage tanks are piped directly to vessels or transferred to totes and drums at drop connections for charging into vessels via hose connections. Likewise, raw materials delivered to the plant in drums or totes are charged to a vessel through the use of hose connections. Dry raw materials in super-sacks are charged to vessels though vacuum systems, however, bags are poured into a vessel through the manway.\n\n\n\nAfter a product is manufactured, it will either be transferred into a tank-truck, a container (totes or drum), a storage tank, or to another reactor/blender acting as holding vessel. All products are eventually delivered to off-site customer locations or to other Nalco Champion plants as intermediates.\n\n\n\n3. The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nA number of processes at this facility are subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. The plant's PSM program incorporates all of the PSM elements identified in the regulation. The standards and procedures developed for the PSM program are applied uniformly in the plant to both PSM covered processes and other chemical processes to ensure that the p"

The accident prevention program is applied to all RMP-regulated processes at Champion. Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accidental scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human error.\n\n\n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nNalco Champion has implemented a written emergency response plan to handle accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including bringing releases under control (when feasible), adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and the notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of affected areas. Employees receive training in emergency procedures. To ensure proper functioning, emergency response equipment is regularly inspected and serviced. In addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within processes that would require a modified emergency response. The emergency plan has been coordinated with and verified by the Fort Bend County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).\n\n\n\nAt all times there is at least one employee either on the facility premises or on-call (i.e., available to respond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time) with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This emergency coordinator is thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facility's emergency response plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the location and "

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe Fresno Facility continues to improve safety through capital investments in facilities and technology to minimize and, where possible, eliminate the potential for releases (including improved perimeter controls and security). The plant is also a Responsible Care member and has developed a site-specific management system conforming to the RC14001 Management System standard which includes processes for managing safety, security, and community awareness and protection."
