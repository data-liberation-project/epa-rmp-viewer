At this Site, our focus is on protecting our employees, the families that live in nearby communities, and the environment.\r\n\r\nWe have designed our process areas to safely manage the chemicals used and produced by our production facilities. It is our policy to not only to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations, most notably as a Responsible Care Company.  We have developed and implemented the following to help achieve our goals:\r\n\r\n* State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes\r\n* Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\r\n* A well-defined safety, health and process safety management system\r\n* Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\r\n* An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\r\n* Site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\r\n\r\nIn addition to these preventative programs, it is the Site's policy to maintain an emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue. The Site coordinates with area, community, emergency-response agencies providing them with information on operations and response programs in addition to  frequent interaction/communication  with members of the local emergency response agencies.\r\n\r\nThe Site has seven substances that exceed the RMP threshold quantities.  These compounds are acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, bromine, chlorine, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus trichloride and trimethylamine.  T"

During unloading, the truck is stationed in a containment area designed to hold 110% of the truck's contents. Acrylonitrile is unloaded via top unloading system into its storage tank. A designed tank truck and unloading station are used to ensure that only the correct raw material is unloaded into the storage tank.

The total ammonia inventory is 55,000 pounds. This includes the amount in the storage tank and associated piping that handle anhydrous ammonia. \r\n\r\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling system consists of an unloading station with secondary containment system, a storage tank, two pumps and piping.

Internal audits are completed using a wide range of Site resources.  Site personnel conduct routine general inspections of Site facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly).  Site and Corporate personnel conduct  plant-wide audits at a minimum three-year frequency.   These audits include safety, housekeeping, transportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechanical integrity inspections.
