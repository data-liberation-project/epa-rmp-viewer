At this Site, our focus is on protecting our employees, the families that live in nearby communities, and the environment.\n\n\n\nWe have designed our process areas to safely manage the chemicals used and produced by our production facilities. It is our policy to not only to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local rules and regulations but also to voluntarily go beyond these requirements to ensure our continued successful and safe operations, most notably as a Responsible Care Company.  We have developed and implemented the following to help achieve our goals:\n\n\n\n* State of the art process equipment and process control design incorporating safety devices and systems needed to properly handle, store or use materials in our processes\n\n* Well-defined and documented operating procedures and control systems\n\n* A well-defined safety, health and process safety management system\n\n* Well-trained production employees coupled to a trained technical staff\n\n* An extensive preventive maintenance and equipment inspection program\n\n* Site access is restricted to authorized employees, management personnel, and authorized contractors\n\n\n\nIn addition to these preventative programs, it is the Site's policy to maintain an emergency response plan and trained personnel and response equipment to be prepared to respond to potential emergencies involving fire, releases of hazardous material, medical emergencies, and confined space rescue. The Site coordinates with area, community, emergency-response agencies providing them with information on operations and response programs in addition to  frequent interaction/communication  with members of the local emergency response agencies.\n\n\n\nThe Site has seven substances that exceed the RMP threshold quantities.  These compounds are acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, bromine, chlorine, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus trichloride and trimethylamine.  T"

During unloading, the truck is stationed in a containment area designed to hold 110% of the truck's contents. Acrylonitrile is unloaded via top unloading system into its storage tank. A designed tank truck and unloading station are used to ensure that only the correct raw material is unloaded into the storage tank. The storage and handling system design minimizes potential leaks by eliminating all tank bottom nozzles and by using the latest control devices.\n\n\n\nThe acrylonitrile storage tank is housed in a secondary containment area. It is pumped to the chemical processing equipment to make the agricultural products. A scrubber destroys all fumes from the unloading operation, the storage tank and the chemical processing steps. The total plant inventory is about 66,000 pounds. This total includes the maximum allowable acrylonitrile in the storage tank, in pipes & hoses, and the amount in the chemical process.\n\n\n\nAmmonia\n\n\n\nLiquid, anhydrous ammonia is received by tank truck (approximately 26,000 pounds per truck) and is stored in a single steel tank at ambient temperature and under its own vapor pressure. This tank is located within a concrete secondary containment system.  The tank is equipped with overpressure protection and is rated to withstand full vacuum. The total ammonia inventory is 55,000 pounds. This includes the amount in the storage tank and associated piping that handle anhydrous ammonia. \n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia handling system consists of an unloading station with secondary containment system, a storage tank, two pumps and piping.  As for all operations at this facility, this system is governed by well-established operating procedures.\n\n\n\nBromine\n\n\n\nBromin"

      "SummaryText": "ading, each truck is stationed in a containment area designed to hold 110% of the truck's contents. A designed tank truck and unloading station are also used to ensure that only the correct raw material is unloaded into its designated storage tank.\n\n\n\nThe storage tanks for phosphorus oxychloride and phosphorus trichloride are installed in a diked area. Each material is pumped to the chemical processing equipment to make the agricultural products. A scrubber destroys all fumes from the unloading operation, the storage tank and the chemical processing steps. The total unit inventory of phosphorus oxychloride is about 100,000 pounds. The total plant inventory of phosphorus trichloride is about 74,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nTrimethylamine\n\n\n\nTrimethylamine (TMA) is shipped to the Site in bulk trailers. Each shipment is about 40,000 pounds. TMA is shipped under pressure in the bulk trailer. Unique pipefittings are used to ensure that only the correct material is unloaded into the TMA storage tank. TMA is transferred to the chemical process to make an intermediate for an agricultural product. The total Site inventory is 83,000 pounds.\n\n\n\nThe Site has a well-established accident prevention program. The primary purpose of the program is to eliminate those events which have the potential to result in personal injury, property loss and environmental or community impact. The secondary purpose of the program is to ensure reliable and predictable operations. The objective of the program is to eliminate all unexpected events. The program consists of four fundamental elements: (1) written procedures; (2) training; (3) auditing; (4) process reviews or evaluation.\n\n\n\n(1) The written procedures include personal health and safety, work practices, equipment operation, loss prevention, and related topics. The procedures are implemented using administrative, engineering and personal protective equipment controls. The procedures receive periodic review and are revised as necessary.\n\n\n\n(2) The trainin"

The frequency of the training varies within a three-year cycle depending upon the employee group and the topic.\n\n\n\n(3) The auditing activities include both internal and external audits.  Internal audits are completed using a wide range of Site resources.  Site personnel conduct routine general inspections of Site facilities on a regular basis (e.g. daily/weekly/monthly).  Site and Corporate personnel conduct  plant-wide audits at a minimum three-year frequency.   These audits include safety, housekeeping, transportation, ergonomics, emergency systems, industrial hygiene, process safety management and mechanical integrity inspections.  Corporate and Division staff, state and federal agencies, insurance companies, etc. also conduct external audits.\n\n\n\n(4) Process Hazard Analyses are completed for each manufacturing and related support facilities on a 5-year cycle in accordance with applicable OSHA Process Safety Management regulations. Selected management of change activities also requires a hazard analysis. The analyses evaluate the impact of unexpected events to both in-plant and off-plant receptors.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history: The Site maintains records of all chemical releases. Our records document that we have had no accidental releases of the RMP-listed substances meeting the RMP rule criteria for the past five years.\n\n\n\nThe Site also has a well-established emergency response plan. Its primary purpose is to guide Site personnel during emergency situations. The secondary purpose is to communicate to the surrounding communities and area response agencies how the Site intends to respond to potential emergency situations. The plan's objective is to provide a coordinated response to potential Site emergencies that could threaten employee health and safety, the local community, the environment or Site prope"

      "SummaryText": "rty.\n\n\n\nThe Site maintains experienced personnel who are fully trained to respond to potential emergencies arising from fires, hazardous material releases, and medical emergencies and confined space incidents. The various teams are equipped to respond to Site emergencies.  The Site recognizes the potential need to utilize community emergency response agencies during some emergency situations. Therefore, Site emergency response teams coordinate with members of the Palmyra, Hannibal, Quincy and Hannibal Rural Fire Departments sharing Site response information. \n\n\n\nThe Site has an effective safety program as indicated by its excellent safety performance record.  The Site has implemented effective programs to minimize the potential for off-site releases. At this time, there are no specific changes planned for the safety program related to the RMP activities. The Site's Operations Leadership Team and Responsible Care Steering Group meet on a regular basis to evaluate performance and to modify and improve the Safety and Environmental programs, as needed."
