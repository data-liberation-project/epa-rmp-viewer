Most of the 299 employees at the McIntosh facility live in Washington, Mobile, Clarke and Baldwin counties. Olin employees are involved in the communities and care about the environment which all of us in Southern Alabama share and enjoy.\nMaintaining open, positive relationships with the communities is a priority at our plant. We understand that we are an integral part of the community. We support the Olin Community Advisory Panel which was formed in 1988 and is comprised of community members who represent business, education, religion, and youth interests. Monthly, members gather with plant management to share information on topics of mutual interests. Annually, representatives of the McIntosh panel join interested community members to tour the McIntosh facility.\nMany items we use every day depend on the products manufactured at the Olin McIntosh Plant. Our primary products: chlorine, and caustic soda, are used to make everything from paper products, clothing, clean water, household bleach, and pharmaceuticals, to plastics, vinyl products, antifreeze, fuels, and paints.\n1.0 ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\nSince it's beginning, Olin has had a safety and environmental program, which relies on the fundamental belief that all accidents are preventable. Our \"Goal is Zero\" incidents for environmental, safety, and transportation. To help insure that an emergency situation with offsite implications is unlikely to occur, Olin has put six layers of safety protection in place. Employees, Mechanical integrity, Process Hazard Reviews, Process Controls, Safety Systems, and Emergency Preparedness.\nAt the Olin, McIntosh, Alabama facility, we are committed to operating and maintaining all of our processes in a safe and responsible manner. We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensur"

These components are used in the Titan space launch vehicles, which have been the Air Force's principle launch system since the mid 1960's. They are also used in satellites for positioning and to operate on-board power systems.\nIn our processes, we used the following RMP covered chemicals that EPA has identified which are Chlorine and Hydrazine compounds.\nTOXICS\nChlorine is shipped primarily by rail car.\nHydrazine is unloaded/loaded, blended, and stored and  shipped in trucks and cylinders. The three hydrazine components handled include: Methyl hydrazine, Dimethyhydrazine, and Hydrazine.\nAlso, included in the RMP list of Regulated Substances and handled at the McIntosh facility, but exempt from the  regulation are Hydrogen and Hydrochloric Acid solutions.

There has been one RMP release in the past five years.\nAs part of our prevention efforts, we have implemented the following prevention steps:\n* Site wide chlorine monitors and area perimeter hydrazine monitors\n* Automatic shut off valves for loading operations\n* Well trained work force\n* Preventative and predictive maintenance systems through mechanical integrity"
