If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to respond as per the procedures set forth in our Emergency Response Plans manual for Cabras Distribution Terminal, South Pacific Petroleum Corporation. As part of our response procedures, the Guam Fire Department will be immediately notified and requested to respond to the emergency.\n\n\n\nA description of your facility and the regulated substance handled: This facility is a wholesale LPG Distribution Terminal. We receive, store, and distribute LPG. Our Facility consists of two 300 metric ton storage bullets mounded together under bedding sand and encased in concrete, a bulk loading gantry, and associated pumps, compressors, and piping.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios: The worst-case scenario would be, during a typhoon, flying debris shearing/rupturing a pipeline(s) at a point below an isolation valve immediately above a storage bullet. If the entire contents of a full storage bullet were to be released and ignited (744,000 lbs) the resulting vapor cloud explosion endpoint distance would extend off-site and have public receptors within that endpoint distance. Our alternative release scenario would be a two inch diameter liquid line hose rupture at the bulk loading gantry resulting in a momentary release and explosion. The end-point distance from that explosion would extend off-site but with no public receptors.\n\n\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps: This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule, the OSHA PSM standard and all applicable local and federal regulations. This facility is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance to NFPA-58.\n\n\n\nFive-year accident history: We have never had an a"
