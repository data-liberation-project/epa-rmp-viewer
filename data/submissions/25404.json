If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy\n to notify the Clarion fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nDescription of Facility:\n This facility is a reatil farm supplier. We sell anhydrous ammonia to farmers for the purpose of crop\n production. On site we have a 12,000 gallon storage tank and two 11,000 gallon storage tanks. These\n storage tanks are filled to a maximum of 85% capacity to allow for product expansion.\n\nWorst Case Release Scenario:\n Our worst case scenario is a gas release from one of our storage tanks. According to EPA's RMP Comp,\n the distance to endpoint is 2.00 miles. There are residences within the distance to endpoint, with a total\n of 124 people affected.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario:\nOur alternative release scenario is a transfer hose failure. According to EPA's RMP Comp, the distance to endpoint is 0.20 miles. There are residences within this distance, with a total of one person affected.\n\nThis facility has excess flow valves and emergency shutoffs in place to minimize the chances of a release occuring. All personnel are trained annually in the safe operation of the equipment and facility. We have also installed concrete barriers in traffic pattern areas in an effort to eliminate the threat of a vehicular accident.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes\n and regulations.This facility is annually inspected by in-house personnel and by the Iowa Department of\n Agriculture.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n We have never had an accident involving anhyd"
