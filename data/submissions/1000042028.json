This commitment is demonstrated by our efforts in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility is a natural gas compression and treating plant.  Low pressure inlet gas streams enter the plant from pipelines.  The gas is compressed and flows through an amine gas sweetening unit to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the gas.  The H2S and CO2 rich acid gas stream from the amine unit is sent to a RRC permitted underground injection well.  The sweetened gas from the amine unit flows through a glycol dehydration unit to remove any water present in the gas.  The gas is further compressed and sent via pipeline to a downstream gas plant for separation of gas and natural gas liquids.\n\n\n\nRegulated flammables are present in amounts greater than the threshold quantity and consist of mixtures of methane, ethane, propane, isobutane, butane, isopentane, and pentane.  The only regulated toxic chemical present in the flammable mixtures is H2S although it is not contained in amounts greater than the threshold quantity.\n\n\n\nOFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS RESULTS\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) associated with a release of flammable substances in Program Level 1 processes at the gas plant is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the full inventory of the largest storage tanks containing 108,700 pounds. A written procedure is in place to limit the storage inventory to 80% of the maximum tank ca"

Although numerous controls are in place to prevent such releases and to manage their consequences, no credit for passive mitigation measures was taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Big Lake Treating Facility. Because processes at the gas plant that are regulated by' the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program.\n\n\n\nEmployee Participation\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility encourages employees to participate in all facets of process safety management and accident prevention. Examples of employee participation range from updating and compiling technical documents and chemical information to participating as a member of a process hazard analysis (PHA) team. Employees have access to all information created as part of the facility accident prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved in the accident prevention program are documented in an employee participation plan that is maintained at the treating facility and addresses each accident prevention program element. In addition, the facility has a number of initiatives under way which address process safety and employee safety issues. These initiatives include forming teams to promote both process and personal safety. The teams typically have members from various areas of the facility, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant management.\n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treatin"

These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the treating facility are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. A table summarizing the reference documents and their location is readily available as part of the written employee participation plan to help employees locate any necessary process safety information.\n\n\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDSs). The treating facility ensures that the process is maintained within acceptable limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\n\n\nThe treating facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment. This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment. This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised. \n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process, as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary. \n\n\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution. Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team. This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention. All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed. The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operating. The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown, and (6) initial startup of a new process.

New employees receive basic training in treating facility operations if they are not already familiar with such operations. After successfully completing this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties and tasks. After operators demonstrate (e.g., through tests, skills demonstration) adequate knowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently. In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level. This refresher training is conducted at least every three years. All of this training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training. \n\n\n\nContractors\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.

In addition, the Big Lake Treating Facility evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor. Treating facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information. The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service. This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready. The PSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness. A PSSR involves field verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.

Written procedures help ensure that work is performed in a consistent manner and provide a basis for training. Inspections and tests are performed to help ensure that equipment functions as intended and to verify that equipment is within acceptable limits (e.g., adequate wall thickness for pressure vessels). If a deficiency is identified, employees will correct the deficiency before placing the equipment back into service (if possible), or a management of change team will review the use of the equipment and determine what actions are necessary to ensure the safe operation of the equipment.\n\n\n\nAnother integral part of the mechanical integrity program is quality assurance. The Big Lake Treating Facility incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.

Two incidents were found to qualify for reporting, one occurred on January 23, 2017 and the second on January 24, 2017, each lasting approximately two minutes.  These incidents were virtually identical in that condensate was released through the flare stack and resulted in a fire on the property neighboring the Big Lake Treating Facility.  The quantity of condensate released during the January 23, 2017 event was 50 pounds and during the January 24, 2017 event was 50 pounds.  The only impact from either incident was burned grass lands on the neighboring property, although neither incident affected an RMP-defined environmental receptor. Therefore, these incidents are being reported under the RMP accident history reporting requirements, but do not affect the program level status of the site per 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).\n\n\n\nA more recent incident occurred on April 14, 2018 when a DGP employee was exposed to an accidental release of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from the acid gas compressor lasting approximately 10 minutes.  The quantity of H2S released was less than one pound, but in a concentration higher than the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level, as measured by the employee's personal H2S monitor, and resulted in the fatality of this employee.  The cause was confirmed via an autopsy conducted on April 16, 2018.  There were not any offsite impacts.  H"

Therefore, this incident does not affect the program level status of the site per 40 CFR 68.10(b)(1).\n\n\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\n\n\nThe Big Lake Treating Facility maintains a written emergency response program that is in place to protect worker and public safety, as well as the environment. The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released. The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.\n\nEmployees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. When necessary, the emergency response program is updated based on modifications made to treating facility processes or other Big Lake support facilities. The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. \n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Big Lake Treating Facility is coordinated with the Reagan County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
