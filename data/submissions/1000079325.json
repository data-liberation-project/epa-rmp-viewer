      "SummaryText": "Risk Management Plan Executive Summary\r\n2019\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulation 40 CFR 68.  An RMP is required when chlorine of 2,500 pounds or greater is stored at the Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  The RMP is required to be updated and submitted to the EPA every five years.  The intent of the RMP is to enhance the safety of the community by the preparedness of the City to respond to emergency situations.  This is accomplished by the joint efforts of the police, fire, and public works departments.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a Process Safety Management Plan (PSM) is in place.  The PSM is required by OSHA Regulation 29 CFR 1910.119.  The PSM is required when chlorine of 1,500 pounds or greater is stored at the WTP.  The PSM and RMP work hand in hand to prevent or minimize exposure to chlorine gas for the safety of Utilities Division employees, residents of Apple Valley and surrounding communities.  A compliance audit of the PSM is required every three years and was last completed in May 2019. The Water Treatment Plant was constructed in 1989 and has been safely treating the community's drinking water supply for over 30 years.  An expansion and upgrade of the water treatment facility was completed in 2015.  The project increased the facilities filtered and treated water capacity from 12 Million gallons per day (MGD) to 18 MGD.  With the existing filter bypass capacity of 6 MGD a total of 22 MGD can be delivered to the residents and businesses within the City.  \r\n\r\nChlorine is used in two phases of the water treatment processes, pre-chlorination and post-chlorination.  In the pre-chlorination process, chlorine is used as an oxidizer to help facilitate bringing the minerals, iron and manganese, out of suspension so they can be removed from the water in the filtration process.  An additional oxidizer, sodium permanganate, is also utilized to oxidize the iron and manganese.  In the post-chlorin"

Construction of the WTP significantly reduced the amount of chlorine within the City for water treatment.  Previously chlorine was utilized at each well site.\r\n\r\nAn average of 6.8 million gallons of water are treated each day at the WTP.  The volume of water treated varies seasonally ranging from 3.5 to 4 million gallons per day in the winter to more than 18 million gallons per day in the summer.  For each million gallons of water pumped, slightly less than 20 pounds of chlorine are used in the treatment process.  Under normal operating conditions 4,000 pounds of chlorine are stored in two one-ton chlorine cylinders.  Up to 3 1-Ton cylinders,6,000 pounds, of chlorine may be on site during peak summer operating conditions when water demand increases, or when seasonal road restrictions limit shipment deliveries. Occasionally there may be an empty 4th 1-Ton cylinder also located in the chlorine room.  Since 2010, the chlorine cylinders in use are placed within a Chlortainer, an airtight enclosure that will contain the chlorine in the event of a chlorine leak.  The Chlortainers greatly increase the safety and security of the chlorine utilized in the treatment process. \r\n\r\nThe pre and post-chlorination processes utilize a vacuum feed principle that prevents the flow of chlorine if the vacuum is interrupted.  If no vacuum is present on the chlorine feed lines it is impossible for any chlorine demand to be created.  This minimizes the risk of a chlorine release in the event of damage to the chlorine piping system.  Scenarios were modeled to determine potential affected residents and businesses.  \r\n\r\nThe RMP Rule requires the Apple Valley Water Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility.  This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis fo"

The entire population was counted for each block fully or partially within the radius.\r\n\r\nNo significant chlorine releases have occurred.  Minute amounts of chlorine are infrequently released during the chlorine tank change out process.  Operational procedures outline the steps WTP operators must follow when changing chlorine cylinders.  Each time a cylinder is changed the chlorinator is inspected and the fittings are tested with an aqua ammonia solution to ensure there are no chlorine leaks.  A daily visual inspection is made of the chlorine room, pre and post- chlorinators, chlorine alarm, chlorine analyzer, and overall facility.  The chlorine suppliers also follow strict safety guidelines for chlorine cylinder and fitting testing as well as transportation and delivery procedures. \r\n\r\nSafety is of utmost importance.  Chemical safety training is required to be done annually by the chemical supplier for all Utility Division employees.  Simulated OSHA safety inspections are done periodically by the City's safety consultant.  Respirator and confined space training is done annually for all Utilities Division employees.  Fire Department employees do monthly inspections of the Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) at the WTP.  In addition, the Fire Department provides annual SCBA training and fit testing for the Utilities Division employees.\r\n\r\nAn emergency backup generator is on site and capable of running the entire facility plus one well during power outages or emergency situations.  \r\n\r\nThe WTP is included in the community emergency response plan.

The DCC will contact the Fire Department, who would assess the situation and, if necessary, contact the Dakota County Special Operations Team (SOT) and the State Duty Officer.  The SOT and State Duty Officer would determine if a HAZMAT team needs to be notified.  The Fire Department, Special Operations Team, Duty Officer, and HAZMAT teams are trained in handling emergency situations involving hazardous materials.  They would also be responsible for mitigating the effects of a release.  The Police Department is also familiar with the site and can provide emergency assistance, in addition to, coordinating evacuation procedures if needed. The Police are typically first on the scene of emergencies.  The Police, Fire and Public Works personnel are all trained in FEMA Incident Command.   \r\n\r\nIn accordance with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, a water system vulnerability assessment of security was done on the water system.  Recommended upgrades from the vulnerability assessment have been implemented; these upgrades should help ensure the security of the WTP and chlorination system.  In addition, an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the water system was initially completed in December 2004 and updated in 2009 to provide guidance for threat, disaster, or emergency operations.  The ERP recognizes the presence of chlorine at the WTP and establishes an Action Plan Guide, Threat Management Tree, and response procedures.  An Risk and Resilience Plan (formerly the Vulnerability Assessment) and Emergency Response plan is currently being updated by SL-serco to comply with regulatory guidelines.  The Risk and Resilience Plan is anticipated to be completed in early 2020.
