In order to minimize the amount of phosgene on-hand at any time, the unit operates on a demand basis.  Only the phosgene required by the consuming production units is being produced at any given time.  The change to on- demand phosgene production allowed the plant to eliminate the storage of up to 40,000 #s of liquid phosgene.  Both area and perimeter ambient air monitors are used to detect any phosgene releases.",

The production units are used to produce higher volume specialty chemicals.  The cold vent unit is designed to recover phosgene from the vent gas stream and recycle it back to the process, thus reducing the volume requiring destruction.  The area is fully fire protected by multiple permanently installed fire monitors.  Area ambient air monitors are used for early detection of any chemical leaks.  All units are automated and operate under computer control.  The plant operating personnel make a full visual check of the units ever four hours to ensure that there are no leaks and that the everything appears normal.",

PPG follows the Responsible Care Codes of Management Practice which are integral to the implementation of the PPG Environment, Health & Safety Policy.   The Responsible Care Community Awareness Code of Management Practice and PPG's  Community Awareness and Emergency Response (CAER) Policy are designed to assure  emergency preparedness and to foster community right-to-know.  PPG's CAER Policy requires each manufacturing  plant to have a pro-active community awareness and emergency response program to handle emergencies that might happen in that facility.

This is accomplished by developing site specific programs that address EHS issues.  These issues are addressed in management accountabilities to assure their effectiveness.  The environmental department and safety department are examples of  this commitment.\n\nRegulated substances handled.\nLa Porte is part of the Specialty Chemicals Strategic Business Unit of PPG Industries, Inc..  La Porte produces alkyl chloroformates, organic acid chlorides, blocked amino acids, both phosgene and non-phosgene based pharmaceutical intermediates and bulk active compounds, and various single use specialty chemicals.  The facility produces or stores chlorine, phosgene, methyl chloroformate, iso-propyl chloroformate, and n-propyl chloroformate.   \n\nWorst-case and alternative case release scenarios.\nAn off-site consequence analysis was performed for the largest quantities of  toxic materials in the facility.  The guidelines and Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance (OCAG) look-up tables were utilized in this process.   \n\nEPA rules require that a worst case scenario be analyzed which would involve the highly unlikely release in ten minutes of the entire contents of the largest vessel or container.  Based on dispersion modeling using OCAG look-up tables and the EPA specified assumptions, offsite concentrations of phosgene would cause offsite impact. \n\nAlternative case release scenarios (ACRS) were developed for each of the listed chemicals in the facility.  These scenarios followed the guidelines provided by EPA and used the OCAG look-up tables to perform the end-point calculations.  The local emergency planning committee and office of emergency planning will utilize the alternative case "

Training is an ongoing process that includes periodic retraining, as necessary.  Safety, environmental, operating, and training procedures are subject to periodic reviews and updates, as appropriate.  Additional systems are in place to review proposed changes and assure that any new training requirements are met.  Another system assures a detailed review for hazards in each operating unit on a prescribed frequency.  Training and updating procedures are monitored with multiple systems.  \n\nThe La Porte facility has an array of maintenance and inspection programs that minimize the possibility of equipment or piping failures.  Routine inspections of equipment are done in the same manner as the initial quality assurance inspections completed prior to installation.  Equipment inspections utilize procedures such as proof testing, where safeguard systems are forced to function in a controlled manner.  This assures that the safeguards will function if they are ever needed.  Preventive and predictive maintenance programs are utilized including, vibration monitoring, infrared images to detect differences in temperature, inspections by insurance specialists, and root-cause analysis procedures.  Piping is inspected and tested with X-rays and hydrostatic tests prior to installation. The piping is monitored by methods such as visual inspections by the operators or maintenance personnel, emissions monitoring using sophisticated instruments, or thickness measurements by people trained in testing procedures.  Maintenance personnel and supervisors are included in many of the training and testing programs that the operators utilize.  Additional training and procedures have been developed for activities that are specific to maintenance.  Although some of the training and testing is specific to maintenance, the s"

      "SummaryText": "ame monitoring process is used.\n\nFive-year accident history.\nThe La Porte plant has not had a release of a regulated chemical that meets the EPA's reporting guidelines in the past five years.\n\nEmergency response program.\n The La Porte plant has a written emergency response plan.  The plan includes\nprocedures for informing the public and emergency response organizations of an emergency condition; documentation of proper first aid and emergency medical treatment; and procedures and measures for emergency response.  The plant's emergency response plan has been reviewed and coordinated with the City of La Porte's emergency response program.  In addition, the plan is coordinated with the Channel Industries Mutual Aid plan.  \n \n In addition to the written plan, La Porte's emergency response program includes a permanently installed fire protection system; mobile fire fighting equipment; a PlantSafe computer based gas dispersion modeling program; membership in the local area-wide industrial emergency response organization; participation with the La Porte Local Emergency Planning Committee in coordinating emergency response plans and in planning and practicing emergency response drills\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety.\nPPG is committed to the process of continuous improvement.  This commitment extends beyond production issues into the environmental and safety aspects of all operations. Changes in control instruments are made on an ongoing basis, as necessary, to assure that the most reliable and effective controls are used.  A fugitive emission collection system is being installed to reduce the possibility of a gas release leaving the plant site. \n\nFor additional plant information, contact John A. Weihrich, Plant Manager, at 281-471-0943.  For additional information about PPG Industries, Inc., see www.ppg.com."
