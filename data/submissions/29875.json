This facility meets the definition of a small business stationary source in Section 507? of the Clean Air Act.\n\nGoldstar Cooperative \nW6311 Highway 63\nEllsworth, WI 54011\n\nFor further information contact: Thomas Overby, Compliance Manager\n\nRisk Management Plan ? EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1.The Facility Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Goldstar Cooperative are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\n2.Facility Information\n\n?The primary activity at the facility is the storage and blending of fertilizers for sale to farmers.\n?Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for both direct application and for blending into mixed-grade fertilizers for crop production nutrients.\n?The maximum quantity stored would be 84,000pounds in our 18,000 gallon storage tank. \n\n3.The worst-case release scenario and the alternate release scenario.\n\nA.The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released 84,000 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 5.1 miles.\n\nB.The alternative release scenario is a release from the break in a transfer hose. The distance to endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.3 miles.\n\n4.The accidental release prevention program.\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by the American"
