Accidental Release Prevention and Response Policies\n\nConstructed in 1973, the Atlantic Energy, Inc. Chesapeake Terminal provides a vital energy service to homeowners, commercial businesses, and industry.  The facility has an excellent safety record, and its employees are key players in achieving that safety record.\n\nAtlantic Energy is committed to safe and reliable operation for the protection of its employees, the community, and the environment.  Atlantic Energy is proud of its 32 year operating record, during which there has never been an incident that resulted in any off-site impacts to neighboring industries, residents or the community at large. This record has been achieved through consistent attention and total dedication by management and staff to safe operating practices and preventive maintenance.  Atlantic Energy has constantly made new investments in the latest technology in operating and maintaining the facility.  These practices form the backbone of Atlantic Energy's dedication to keeping the facility and its community safe.\n\n\nB. Description of the Source and Regulated Substances Handled.\n\nThe Atlantic Energy Terminal in Chesapeake, VA imports and stores fully refrigerated liquid propane (also called liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) at -45 deg F.  The terminal processes this product by heating it to +40 deg F for shipment to its customers by truck and rail.  Ethyl mercaptan, an odorizing agent, is added to the LPG being distributed from the terminal.  Both propane and ethyl mercaptan are regulated flammable substances.  The terminal has no RMP listed toxic chemicals in threshold quantities.\n\n\nC. Release Prevention Program\n\nThe terminal was designed and built in accordance with provisions of the following three recognized standards for LPG facilities:\n\n*  NFPA 58, Standard for the Storage and Handling of Liquefied Petroleum Gases, (National Fire Protection Association).\n"

Safety reviews have been undertaken periodically since that time.  Many recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented through equipment and procedural changes.\n\nThe intial process hazard analysis (PHA) for the facility was completed in October 1997.  The update and revalidation of that PHA was completed in January 2003.  Both PHAs led to plant improvements and similar results can be expected from future studies."
