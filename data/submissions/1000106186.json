The primary function of\nthe Air Liquide Electronics U.S. LP (ALEUS) facility at 32500 N 51st Ave is to supply bulk gasses to our customer via pipeline\non a 24 hour, 365-day basis. Bulk gasses other than hydrogen are inert and non-regulated by this program (Helium and CO2).\nThe facility manufactures hydrogen by process of catalytic reformation. During the process of manufacturing hydrogen,\nmethane is combined with steam at high temperatures in a two-phase reaction to generate hydrogen and water. Hydrogen is\nstored in liquid form in stationary bulk tanks and transported in gaseous form via pipeline to the on-site customer.\nThe ALEUS stationary source located at 32500 N 51st Ave, includes two 25,000 US gallon vacuum-insulated cryogenic, horizontal) tanks of liquefied hydrogen and small amounts of hydrogen within the process vessels and piping.\nThe chemical specific accidental release and accident prevention steps are those used to mitigate risk from flammable gases.\nEmployees are consulted and trained on the process using standard operating procedures.
