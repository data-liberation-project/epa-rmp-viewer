Additional ventilation to the outside has maintained a safe working environment in the maintenance area.\r\n\r\nA fiberglass contractor re-laminated the top of the aqueous ammonia tank to seal the crack permanently in early March of 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM:\r\nConklin Company has a written Emergency Response Plan that describes how emergency situations are to be handled. A contract is in place with a local chemical spill response contractor. Conklin's employee Emergency Response Team (ERT) is trained to respond to emergency situations. A team member is assigned to notify and communicate with the Minnesota Duty Officer, the spill contractor, and outside agencies in the event of an emergency release. ERT training consists of spill response, release-reporting requirements, air sampling equipment, personal protective equipment, emergency response procedures, first aid and CPR, and more.\r\n\r\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\r\nThe aqua ammonia storage tank, containment dike, and storage building were all newly constructed and installed in 1998 in compliance with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Minnesota Department of Agriculture rules and regulations. Construction of a new stainless steel tank for aqueous ammonia to replace the existing fiberglass tank is being evaluated."

The regulated substance, aqua ammonia (ammonium hydroxide), a 28-30% solution of ammonia and water, is stored on site for use in making fertilizer.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES:\r\nThis facility complies with Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Minnesota Department of Agriculture regulations for the storage and handling of ammonium hydroxide. It is our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and to take additional steps necessary to prevent releases from occurring. Should an accidental release occur, it is our policy to contact the Minnesota Duty Officer to report the incident and request any needed assistance, and to notify the National Response Center in the event of a release of a CERCLA RQ material. Conklin has contracted with a private spill contractor, should a major spill occur that is beyond the capabilities of Conklin's Emergency Response Team to safely handle.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\r\nThe Prevention Program has several components. It includes information on the regulated chemical, process technology, and the equipment involved. A process hazard analysis was used to identify hazards. Operating procedures describe the steps necessary for safely handling ammonium hydroxide from itA\u00bfs being received to its use in production. Operator training and contractor requirements help to ensure the safe handling of ammonium hydroxide and process equipment. Written procedures, equipment inspection and testing, quality assurance, and the training of maintenance personnel are completed to ensure the mechanical integrity of the system. A policy is in place to manage changes to the system to ensure they are reviewed for safety before implementation.\r\n\r\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\r\nOn Thursday, December 9, 202"

      "SummaryText": "1 about 12:05PM, at the conclusion of offloading a tanker of aqueous ammonia, maintenance staff noticed liquid on the floor in the maintenance area by the bulk storage tanks. After donning a respirator, Earl Krueger discovered aqueous ammonia present in the containment area of the bulk aqueous ammonia tank as well.  With an ammonia spill, the building was evacuated, 911 was called and Shakopee Fire and Police arrived shortly.  All personnel were accounted for.  The entire building was shut down for the day and staff sent home.  Earl Krueger maintained security on-site until Bay West LLC showed up later in the day.\r\n\r\nScott Hass with Scott County Emergency Management arrived shortly after emergency services and indicated that a call to the Minnesota Duty Officer was unnecessary if we had Bay West, LLC handle cleanup.\r\n\r\nBay West LLC was contracted to facilitate cleanup using all appropriate safety protocols.  They arrived around 5:30PM.  The outside of the ammonia tank and containment area were completely rinsed and the rinse water/ammonia was collected and placed in caged plastic totes for disposal.  Bay West LLC will determine disposition of the waste solution.  Waste cleanup was completed around 7:45PM. The total amount of material for disposal is only 180-200 gallons of water/ammonia.  Earl Kruger and Steven Holtzleiter were present while Bay West completed the cleanup.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, December 10, 2021, the interior odor was diminished and virtually undetectable in the south office areas.  There was still a slight odor in the maintenance area and the production areas.  For this reason, production was sent home for the day.  Office areas on the North end were open with only a minimally detectable odor present in those areas.  \r\n\r\nFurther inspection of the ammonia tank on Friday, December 10, 2021 discovered a crack on the top in the tank where the large vent pipe exits to the building roof.  This crack was temporarily sealed with a two-component polyurethane patch,"
