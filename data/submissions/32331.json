Raw water is processed and disinfected with chlorine in the treatment process. The Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains a maximum inventory of 8,000 pounds of chlorine in one-ton containers, which above the threshold level and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Risk Management Program.\n\nChlorine, a chemical required by regulation to be used in the disinfection process, has been in use at the Wastewater Treatment Plant since operation began.  One accidental release of chlorine meeting the requirements of the five year accident history has occurred at the Plant. The release resulted in no off site injuries, deaths or environmental impacts and only six persons off site were evacuated as a precautionary measure.\n\n\nPrevention Program\n\nThe Wastewater Treatment Plant is subject to Prevention Program 2 of the Risk Management Program.  In accordance with the requirements of Program 2, the Wastewater Treatment Plant maintains specifications for the equipment associated with the chlorine feed system and has documented the codes and standards adhered to in designing, constructing, and operating the system.  The safe operating ranges for the chlorine system are documented, and it is operated within these safe ranges.\n\nThe results of the original hazard review were evaluated in conjunction with the August 2002 compliance audit for the chlorine system. Identified action items from the previous review were in compliance at that inspection. An additional hazard review was conducted just prior to this update as required every five years. Plant personnel are currently undergoing training updates on the chlorine process and new safety equipment. The next hazard review will be performed in five years or when a major process change is made to the system. The next compliance audit will be performed in three years.  \n\nA compliance audit was also perform"

A team of City and Plant personnel conducts a compliance audit of the Plant operations and procedures once every three years or whenever a major process modification is made.  A compliance audit checklist has been developed based on American Water Works Association recommendations.  A system to correct any deficiency discovered during the compliance audit is in place.\n\nWritten procedures for the operation and maintenance of the chlorine system are in place at the Wastewater Treatment Plant. Procedures are currently under review and being updated to include new safety equipment.  Procedures are being updated in 2004 to incorporate the addition of the Halogen Emergency Control Valve system. Operators underwent initial training in October 2003 prior to installation and will be individually trained on new procedures during 2004. Once revision and re-training is complete, Plant personnel will continue to review procedures periodically or whenever a major process change occurs. \n\nWastewater Treatment Plant operators receive training in the operation of the chlorine system through classes and on-the-job instruction.  Competency is determined through supervisor observation and operator demonstration of activities.  Operators receive refresher training at least every three years, or more often as necessary.  Only qualified operators operate the chlorine system.\n\nIn the event of an accidental release, or a situation that could lead to an accidental release, there are procedures in place to investigate such incidents, develop findings and recommendations for corrective action, and implement the recommendations.\nPersonnel working at the Plant are trained to notify emergency personnel in the event of a significant chlorine leak.  In the unlikely event a chlorine release requiring the assistance of offsite emergency response personnel occurs, the City of Cleburne Fire Department is responsible for responding to the accident, coordinating "
