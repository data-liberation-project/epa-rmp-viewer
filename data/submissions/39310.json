Facilities are subject to the RMP rule if they have more than a threshold quantity of one or more of the regulated 77 acutely toxic substances, 63 flammable gases or volatile liquids in a process. Part 68 requires that sources with more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance in a process develop a prevention program, emergency response program and to communicate to the public the regulated substances handled, five-year accident history, worst-case release scenario and an alternative release scenario.\n     It is the Albany Water, Gas and Light (WG&L) policy to operate a safe Water Treatment Plant (WTP), reducing to the greatest extent possible of any hazards associated with the processes and reducing subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment. This policy includes working with the surrounding Community and local emergency response agencies to promote a spirit of cooperation and teamwork to orchestrate an effective contingency plan in the unlikely event of a process incident occurring at the Albany WG&L WTP.\n     The Albany WG&L WTP provides potable water to the city of Albany and portions of Dougherty County. We use chlorine for disinfecting drinking water per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1976 Safe Drinking Water Act.\n     Chlorine is one of the chemical elements. Neither the gas or the liquid is explosive or flammable; however, like oxygen, it is capable of supporting combustion. Both react chemically with many substances. Chlorine gas is greenish yellow in color; liquid is a clear amber color. Chlorine gas is about two and one-half times heavier"

One volume of liquid when vaporized will produce about 460 volumes of gas. Chlorine is extremely corrosive when in contact with moisture. Chlorine is easy to detect at very low concentrations and has a penetrating and irritating odor.\n     When receiving a new shipment or changing empty chlorine ton cylinders, there will a minimum of three plant operators, safety equipment and the WTP Chlorine Handling Standard Operating Procedure checklist.\nAll chlorine cylinders are received, stored and used in a chlorine storage room designed under the 1994 Uniform Fire Code (Article 80, Hazardous Materials, in particular), the 1991 Uniform Building Code and the latest NIOSH guidelines. The chlorine storage room has limited access, is visually monitored a minimum of six times daily by plant personnel and is equipped with a chlorine leak detector.\n     In the event of a chlorine leak, the chlorine leak detector will automatically start a chlorine room scrubber, activate a visual and audible alarm at the chlorine storage site and in the WTP control room. The chlorine scrubber is sized to an anticipated release including the flow rate, quantity of the leak and the volume of the room. Fresh air is introduced at the top of the containment room while contaminated air is removed from the bottom. The scrubber maintains a negative pressure in the room during the entire release and subsequent scrubbing period with a minimum over all system removal efficiency of 99.99%. The Scrubber will safely absorb more than 2350 pounds of chlorine (a ton cylinder plus 15%).\n     In the event of an uncontrolled chlorine leak, plant staff will call \u00bf911\u00bf.
