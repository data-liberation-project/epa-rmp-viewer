As a corporation, Albemarle has committed to following the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care&reg; program, including the Process Safety Code.  Albemarle Corporation's 2014 Health, Safety, Security and Environmental Policy states, in part:\n\n\n\nWe will take personal responsibility for safety and are committed to ensuring that we cause no harm to ourselves, our co-workers or the communities in which we operate. Our goal is to maintain an incident-free, secure and healthy workspace.  Working in a safe, secure and environmentally responsible manner is an inherent part of our jobs and a condition of employment for each of us. We will comply with all applicable legal requirements and company policies and procedures. Our commitment is deep and serious: Any employee, whether salary or wage, who violates safety, process safety, environmental or security policies and procedures at any time, or commits an unsafe act, whether there is a resulting incident or not, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Each of us will take appropriate steps, including discontinuing operations if necessary, to correct actions and conditions before they lead to incidents, and no one will undertake any task unless it can be done in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.  We adhere to the principles and expectations of Responsible Care&reg; in our daily operations.\n\n\n\nThe Albemarle Pasadena facility has a robust commitment to emergency response, coordinating site-wide emergency response teams with our site partners, Houston Ship Channel industry neighbors, and local authorities.\n\n&#8195;\n\n\n\nFacility and Regulated Su"

The primary product group at the plant is a family of chemicals known as organometallics.  The primary use of these chemicals is as a catalyst in the plastics and other industries.  Some of the organometallics are also used on-site in the production of other specialty organic chemicals, including industrial intermediates, agricultural chemicals, and curatives.  Albemarle Pasadena shares its site with three partner companies.\n\n\n\nPer ?68.130, there are six chemicals regulated under the EPA Risk Management Program that are present above the threshold quantity at the Albemarle Pasadena site.  Listed toxic chemicals are chlorine and methyl chloride.  Listed flammable chemicals are 1-butene, ethyl chloride, 2-methyl propene (isobutylene), and isopentane.  Anhydrous hydrogen chloride, ethylene, and hydrogen are used on the plant site, but in quantities below the regulatory threshold.\n\n\n\nRegardless of regulatory listing or quantity, Albemarle Pasadena manages all site processes and equipment as if they were covered by the OSHA PSM or EPA RMP standards.  Our release prevention plan and contingency planning programs are tools that we use to manage the potential hazards posed by these chemicals to our employees, the public and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nAlbemarle Corporation has always believed in taking a structured, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.  The most significant management system in place is the Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to comply with and exceed the requirements set forth by OSHA in 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n\n\nThe Albemarle Pasadena site has implemented an aggressive mechanical integrity and inspection program to identify and correct potential problems before they occur.

The plant program provides the essential planning and training to effectively protect workers, emergency responders, the public and the environment during an emergency.  Our emergency response plan is coordinated with that of the community, the Pasadena LEPC, the Channel Industries Mutual Aid Association (CIMA) and industrial neighbors who share our fence line (SunEdison, Ethyl and Enterprise).  This shared fence line defines our chemical complex.\n\n\n\nThe site emergency response team (ERT) is composed of members from all companies operating on the complex.  The ERT consist of  four sections that include the fire brigade, the haz-mat team, the rescue team and the emergency medical team.  All team members are trained to the hazardous materials technician level, which allows them to not only respond to fires, but also spills of hazardous material.  To assure that the ERT is ready for any complex emergency, frequent drills are held with our industrial neighbors on the complex.  In addition, the ERT also participates in the local mutual aid (CIMA) drills.  Drills are also used to evaluate the ability of complex personnel to understand and operate under the emergency plan.  In addition to our emergency personnel, our emergency response has a fully equipped ambulance, two fire trucks, a rescue vehicle and a haz-mat truck.  In addition to complex emergencies, these vehicles are also available to the Channel Industries Mutual Aid Association for off-plant responses.\n\n\n\nAlbemarle has the responsibility for maintaining the mobile emergency response equipment and for training of the members of the ERT.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nCon"

      "SummaryText": "tinuous improvement of safety performance is part of Albemarle Pasadena's operating philosophy.  This is handled through the PHA program, hazard recognitions, and other efforts.  Some current efforts include:\n\n\n\n- Layer of protection analyses are being applied to all covered processes to ensure that all safeguards are independent and adequate to prevent a catastrophic release.\n\n\n\n- Ventilation systems are being installed in a set of reactor cubicles to reduce the likelihood of an accumulation of flammable vapors due to a significant release\n\n\n\n- Safety instrumented systems are being designed and improved for a set of reactors.\n\n"
