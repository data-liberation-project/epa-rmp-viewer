The owner, management, and employees of Cropmate Company, Brayton, Ia. are commited to the prevention of any accidential release of anhydrous ammonia or propane. If an accidential release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local Fire Department, LEPC, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and to minimize the impact of the release on people and the environment.\n\nII. FACILITY INFORMATION.\nA. The primary activity at the facility is the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia and propane for sale to farmers and other customers.\nB. Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and disriibuted for application on crops as a fertilizer nutrient.\nC. Propane is received, stored, and distributed as LP- Gas to the end user.\nD. The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia stored would be 131000 pounds in a 30000 gallon storage tank.\nE. The maximum quantity of propane stored would be 110000 pounds in a 30000 gallon storage tank.\n\nIII. THE WORST CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO FOR ANHYDROUS AMMONIA.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 131000 pounds, which represents the volume of the tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200ppm) is 1.06 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario, is based on a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint(point of dispersion to 200ppm) is .59 miles.\n\nIV. THE WORST CASE AND ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO'S FOR PROPANE.\nA. The worst case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of the storage tank. The maximum quantity released would be 110000 pounds. The distance to endpoint(1-psi) would be .40 miles.\nB. The alternative release scenario, is based on a disch"
