      "SummaryText": "The Duke Water Systems Lake Hartwell Filter Plant is a water treatment plant that provides drinking water to customers in the area of Anderson, South Carolina. To ensure that our water remains safe throughout the distribution system to every tap, the Lake Hartwell Filter Plant adds a small amount of chlorine as a disinfection agent.\n\nThe concentrated form of chlorine is liquefied and stored in one ton containers. Before it is mixed with water, chlorine can be extremely hazardous if released to the air.  \n\nDuke Water Systems is committed to protecting its employees, the public, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used at its facilities.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases.  If there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through county emergency management agencies.\n\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\n\nThe Lake Hartwell Filter Plant has conducted an offsite consequence analysis including a worst-case release scenario.  As required by the EPA RMP regulations, the worst-case scenario is defined as the release of an entire one ton container as a gas in ten-minutes.  The regulations require assuming worst-case wind speed and atmospheric conditions that result in the greatest projected impact distance. \n\nFor the offsite consequence analyses, the \"endpoint\" concentration is defined by the Emergency Response Planning Guideline (ERPG-2) values developed by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).  AIHA defines the ERPG-2 value as, \"the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual's ability to take protecti"

In fact, release reporting databases and water industry experience suggest that the worst-case release scenario as defined in the RMP regulations is so unlikely that it should not be used as the basis for emergency planning.  A more reasonable potential release scenario for emergency planning is presented in \"The alternative release scenario(s)\" section below.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nA \"credible worst-case\" scenario was selected as the Lake Hartwell alternative release scenario. This scenario assumes that the vacuum regulator connection to the container is completely severed with the valve wide open resulting in a gas release through the maximum 5/16-inch valve body. .\n\nThe results of the process hazard analysis (PHA) and the facility's operating history suggest that even this credible worst-case is extremely unlikely to occur, but it can serve as the basis for emergency planning. \n\nBased upon Exhibit 4-15 of the EPA RMP Guidance for Wastewater Treatment Plants, the potential distance to the endpoint concentration f"

As with the worst-case scenario, actual distances and directions vary with terrain and weather conditions.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\n\nDuke Water Systems is committed to personnel safety, public safety, continued reliable operation and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Water Operations Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The Water Operations Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\n\nTo ensure a worst-case or alternative release scenario does not occur, the Lake Hartwell Filter Plant maintains a release prevention program with the primary focus of protecting plant employees and the public from the hazards associated with an accident or release involving chlorine.  The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n\n( vacuum feed of chlorine to minimize the chance of release if equipment fails;\n( chlorine detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n( process safety information to document the safe process design;\n( process hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n( operating procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\n( maintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations;\n( training, hot work permits, contractor safety and employee participation programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\n( management of change and pre-startup safety reviews to ensure that changes are document"

The plant has maintained an excellent safety record and we know of no accidental chlorine release throughout its more than 30 year operating history .  \n\nEmergency Response\n \nIn the event that a chlorine release does occur, the Lake Hartwell Filter Plant has an emergency response program that coordinates emergency response with the Anderson County LEPC. If such a release did occur, plant personnel would contact the Anderson County LEPC who would dispatch a trained HAZMAT team to the site to handle the chlorine release. \n\nMaintaining A Safe Operation\n \nThe Lake Hartwell Filter Plant continually works to safely manage the hazards of chlorine to protect employees and the community we serve. The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices. Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization."
