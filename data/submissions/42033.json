      "SummaryText": "The Catawba River Water Treatment Plant (CRWTP) located off of Hwy 5 in Van Wyck, SC uses chlorine gas to disinfect water. The chlorination process uses chlorine gas stored in 2,000 pound cylinders. The CRWTP has trained personnel onsite at all times. Filter personnel are trained in chlorine cylinder procedures, which include connecting, disconnecting and emergency procedures.The chlorination process is equipped with automatic shutoff valves in the event of a loss of vacuum pressure. The chlorine storage area has gas monitors to detect chlorine leaks that initiate startup of a chlorine scrubber that contains and neutralizes any chlorine gas escape from a vessel. The CRWTP purchases DOT approved cylinders. In the event of a chlorine gas leak that escapes the scrubber (equipment failure) CRWTP personnel are instructed to call the local HAZMAT team for emergency response. They will monitor wind direction and estimate the amount of chlorine in the cylinder at the time of the release. The worst case scenario would be a loss of 2,000 pounds of chlorine gas, and a failure of the scrubber, which would yeild a toxic endpoint distance of 3.0 miles. The alternative scenario would yeild a toxic endpoint distance of 0.6 miles. The CRWTP has not had an incident involving chlorine in the last five years. The CRWTP has not had an incident involving chlorine since it began processing water in 1992. With the addition of the chlorine scrubber, off site consequences have been eliminated."
