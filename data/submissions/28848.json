Nearly 20 acres are developed with the remaining area leased to a local farmer for the purpose of growing crops.  The facility formulates and packages crop protection products used to grow crops that provide high-quality, low-cost food for families throughout the world.\nAccidental Release Prevention Policy\nThe management and employees of this facility are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases, especially hazardous materials.  Accidental release prevention is critical to the safe operation of this plant, the safety of its employees and safety of the community.\nTo achieve its accident and accidental release prevention goals, Omnium is committed the following:\n\u00bf\tA knowledgeable, motivated and highly trained employee group\n\u00bf\tA well-designed facility that is maintained and operated in a superior manner\n\u00bf\tImprovements that enhance safety and accident prevention\n\u00bf\tExcellence in safety programs and practices, and an outstanding safety and accident record\n\u00bf\tPreparation and training for emergency response.\nEmergency Response Policy\nOmnium has a written Emergency Response Plan, as required by RMP and other EPA and OSHA rules, and is committed to respond to any accidental release to minimize the impact to employees, the community and the environment.  The response plan is coordinated with the LEPC and emergency response agencies.  Omnium personnel have interacted with these agencies for many years regarding the plan and activities at the facility.  In addition, employees are trained in the implementation of the plan and possible response activities that could be required in the event of an emergency.\nRegulated Substances Handled\nMethyl Merca"

If physical contact occurs, the skin or eyes may become irritated. Breathing of vapors may cause desensitization of the nose, depending on concentration and duration, increased respiration, convulsions, muscle paralysis and death.\nMethyl Mercaptan is highly flammable, having a flash point <-2\u00b0F (-17\u00b0C). Methyl Mercaptan reacts with carbon steel or iron in the absence of oxygen to form ferrous sulfide. Ferrous sulfide, when exposed to air, will oxidize and generate enough heat to ignite any Mercaptan vapors present as well as other flammable vapors. \n\nSynopsis of Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\nThe EPA has defined a worst-case scenario as the release of the largest quantity of a listed chemical from a vessel or process line failure without taking into account active mitigation controls.  The release distance is determined using EPA defined atmospheric conditions and is intended to provide an estimate of the maximum possible area that might be affected.  According to EPA, the worst-case scenario is intended to ensure that no potential risks to the public health are overlooked, but the distance to an endpoint estimated under worst-case should not be considered a \u00bfpublic danger zone.\u00bf  Possible causes of the extreme improbability that such releases may occur are not considered.\nOmnium\u00bfs hypothetical worst-case scenario regarding a toxic substance involves a 162,450 pound Methyl Mercaptan release from a delivery railcar.  The worst-case assumes, as required by RMP, that the entire contents of the vessel are released over a period of 10 minutes as a result of a catastrophic failure.  This worst-case scenario has off-site impacts.\nThe alternative"

In this scenario, it is assumed that the release occurs over a period of 4 minutes, at which time human intervention stops the release.  This alternative release scenario has off-site impacts.\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOmnium is subject to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, 29 CFR 1910.119.  Elements of the PSM rule are included in the Program 3 Prevention Program under EPA\u00bfs RMP rule.\nThe OSHA PSM/EPA Prevention Program consists of a set of facility management policies and procedures that promote and recognize process safety and the prevention of accidents in plants that handle, use, store, or process hazardous chemicals.  The procedures provide accident prevention process controls to all aspects of facility operations.\nOmnium adheres to the requirements of PSM and has written policies and procedures addressing all aspects of PSM and EPA Prevention Program requirements.  The facility has addressed the elements of accident prevention included in the programs throughout its years of operation.\nDue to the variety of substances Omnium handles in the normal course of doing business, several separate spill prevention programs and operating procedures are in place as an effort to reduce the risk or consequence of an accidental release.  A section in the plant\u00bfs Emergency Response Manual is devoted to general chemical spill prevention while a separate program is in effect for preventing spills of petroleum products.\nThe system which is designed an"
