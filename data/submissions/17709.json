In keeping with this policy, our objective as a company is to reduce waste and achieve minimal adverse impact on air, water, and land through excellence in environmental control.\n\nWe recognize that the responsibilities for safety, health and the environment\nare shared:\n1. We accept the responsibility for leadership of the safety & health program, and for its effectiveness and improvement, and for providing the safeguards required to ensure safe conditions.\n2. Our managers and supervisors are responsible for developing the proper attitudes toward safety, health and the environment in themselves and in those they supervise; and for ensuring that all operations are performed with the utmost regard for the safety and health of all personnel involved, including themselves.\n3. Our employees are responsible for wholehearted, genuine cooperation with all aspects of the safety and health program, including compliance with all rules and regulations, and for continuously practicing safety while performing their duties.\n\nOur environmental guidelines include the following:\n\n1. Environmental protection is a line responsibility and an important measure of employee performance. In addition, every employee is responsible for environmental protection in the same manner as for safety.\n2. Reducing or eliminating the generation of waste has been and continues to be a prime consideration in research, process design, and operations; and is viewed by management like safety, yield and loss prevention.\n3. Source reduction / waste minimization (reuse and recycling) of materials has been and will continue to be given first consideration prior to classification and disposal of waste.\n\nThe systemic program review and update shall include:\n\n1.

Revision of the Plan when necessary.\n\nOur St. Gabriel, LA chemical distributing facility has tank, tote, bag, and drum. It handles millions of pounds of chemicals / year. We have an Emergency Response Plan that assigns responsibilities for preventing hazardous releases.\n\nThe following chemicals are listed in program 2: Hydrochloric Acid (>37%), Hydrofluoric Acid (70%)\n\nIn regard to Hydrochloric Acid safety, this material is stored in drums and totes, outside, away from strong acids, strong alkalis, alkali metals, brass, copper, hypochlorites, and other incompatible materials. We have available self-contained breathing apparatus in case of an emergency spill or other release of liquid and vapor. The follwoing considerations are taken in the case of Hydrochloric Acid:\n\n1a. In a Worst Case Scenario (such as the bursting of a drum and releasing its contents), emergency services (such as the fire department) would be informed. Unnecessary personnel would leave the area to a distance of 0.50 miles. Other facilities would be informed within this distance, and appropriate personal protective equipment (including self-contained breathing apparatus) would be put on trained personnel, the spill would be contained by diking the spill area, and put into a salvage container for disposal. See our document ER 002 (Delta Emergency Response Plan).\n\n1b. In an Alternate Case Scenario (such as a minor leak in a drum, releasing some of its contents), the same procedure as the Worst Case Scenario would be followed except evacuation would only be necessary to a distance of 0.10 miles.\n\n2. There have been no accidents involving Hydrochloric Acid within the last five years.\n\n3.
