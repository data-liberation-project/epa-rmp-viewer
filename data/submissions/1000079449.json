Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Sealed Air Corporation (SAC) Holyoke facility  has many policies and procedures to ensure the safe operation of its facilities. Some of these include the written operating procedures describing how to execute a task safely, training employees on the procedures that are needed to perform their jobs, training employees how to respond to emergencies, and empowering employees to shut down activities that they believe are unsafe.  In addition, the Holyoke facility has implemented an accidental release prevention policy which integrated containment technologies, redundant safety systems, operating/emergency procedures and management processed.  The applicable procedures of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are adhered to. \n\n \n\n2 .  The Stationary Source and Regulated Substance Handled.\n\nSAC - Holyoke facility manufactures light weight foam packaging used in the consumer industry.  The plant uses propane as a blowing agent to make plastic foam.  This is the only regulated substance in threshold quantities at this location.  Propane (CAS 74-98-6) is a flammable aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to gasoline.  Propose is used and stored as a liquid, but is released (slowly out gassed) from the product during the manufacturing process.\n\n\n\n3.  The Worst and Alternative Case Scenarios.\n\nThe worst case release scenario as defined by EPA assumes out storage tank completely fails, all safety systems fail, worst-case weather conditions exist, the vapors find an ignition source and released forms a gas explosion.  The endpoint is 1psi overpressure is 0.3 miles.  The alternative release scenario is more credible scenario based on an analysis of potential hazards at our facility.  Maximum release of pounds from a catastrophic failure of the delivery piping system.  The impact distances is based on maximum distance at which the radiant heat affects of a vapor cloud fire might have serious consequences, >.1 "
