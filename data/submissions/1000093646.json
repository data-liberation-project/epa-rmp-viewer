The facility is located at 1925 and 2101 Lone Star Drive, Dallas, Texas 75212.  The SIC code for the operation is 2013; the NAICS code is 311612.  \n\n\n\nThere are two manufacturing buildings located at the facility.  The existing building (1925 Lone Star Dr.), located on the north side of the property, houses production, laboratories, maintenance areas, and management offices.  There is an ammonia refrigeration system located in the existing building.  This system is identified as System 1.  \n\n\n\nA new building (2101 Lone Star Dr.), located on the south side of the property, is used only for production.  It operates a separate ammonia refrigeration system that contains greater than 10,000 lbs of ammonia.  This system is identified as System 2.\n\n\n\nIt is possible for a catastrophic incident in System No. 1 to impact System No. 2 therefore they are being considered co-located facilities and one covered Process for RMP filing purposes. Separate Offsite Consequence Analyses are provided for clarity.\n\n\n\nThe facility has approximately 300 full time employees.  The facility typically operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 52 weeks per year.  Approximately 50 employees are assigned to the new production building, split between two operating shifts.  Staffing is greater during normal business hours due to the presence of management and administrative personnel.\n\n\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration systems are part of the process to keep products and raw materials fresh.\n\n40 CFR 68.130 lists anhydrous ammonia as a hazardous chemical subject to the RMP regulation with a threshold quantity of 10,000 lbs.  The final working capacity of each system exceeds 10,000 pounds.  The refrigeration systems operate 24 hours a day.  System loading varies with production and process demands but the"

The systems are inspected periodically for proper operation 24 hours per day.  System parameters are logged in a permanent record, as are routine maintenance activities.\n\n\n\nThe systems are equipped with a series of redundant failsafe devices, sensors, and overrides.  In the event a malfunction occurs that could result in an ammonia release, these protective devices shut the system down.  The systems cannot be restarted until the cause of the shutdown is identified and corrected.  The systems are equipped with alarm systems that are triggered by the presence of ammonia in the engine rooms.

These serve as the prevention plan required by RMP.  Qualified outside contractors are used for construction and major repairs or modifications to the system.  The facility's PSM programs include provisions for process hazard analyses, management of change, pre-start up safety reviews, safe work practices, inspections, testing, maintenance, compliance audits, and contractor qualifications.  The PSM program is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  All significant changes to the system are reviewed in accordance with the PSM / RMP management of change provisions in the facility's plans.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program - ?68.155(e)\n\n\n\nThe facility has made arrangements with the local fire department to respond to emergencies involving ammonia.  The facility conducts periodic incident response drills.  The facility has not experienced an ammonia release that resulted in employee, contractor or off-site injuries, or offsite evacuation or sheltering in place in the last five years.  Facility personnel are trained to safely control small, incidental releases of ammonia, in the event they should occur.\n\n\n\nThe facility has complied with the requirements of section 302 and 303 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) by notifying the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), and the Fire Department of the presence of ammonia at the site.  The facility files a Tier 2 Chemical Inventory each year with the SERC, LEPC and the Fire Department as required by sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.
