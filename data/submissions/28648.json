      "SummaryText": "Ameren Energy Generating Newton Plant\n\nThe Ameren Energy Generating Newton Plant is located on Newton Lake in Jasper County, Illinois, approximately 8 miles southwest of the city of Newton.  Newton Plant began producing electricity in 1977.\n\nOne ton cylinders connected to a common header feed system have been safely used at the Newton Plant for the past 26 years.  The system has been periodically upgraded through the years.  There have been no significant injuries or releases of chlorine during the entire operating period.\n\nThe plant typically uses 24000 pounds of chlorine each year to prevent bio-fouling of equipment associated with the water treatment plant.  Chlorine is continuously added to the feed water for the water treatment plant which produces ultra pure water for boiler makeup.  The system is equipped with chlorine leak detection monitors, and leak checks are performed during routine maintenance.  The chlorine cylinders are located on the east side of the water treatment plant which is along a frequently traveled plant road.  This location enables both Operations and Maintenance personnel to detect quickly any abnormal conditions. The water treatment plant chlorine injection system is a vacuum induced flow through a regulator and v-notch flow controller.  If the vacuum is lost, the regulator will close, and the feed for the injection system will be shut off.  Additionally, there is a chlorine gas detector located near the chlorine cylinders to detect any leakage from the cylinders or associated piping.  If this sensor detects the presence of chlorine gas, an alarm will sound in the Water Treatment Plant and in the main control room of the generating plant.\n\nThe plant also uses approximately 50 tons per year of chlorine at the Screen House to chlorinate non-contact cooling water to prevent bio-fouling of the plant condensers and heat exchangers.  Circulating water is pumped from Newton Lake, and chlorine is added by vacuum induced water flow through a regu"

If the vacuum is lost, the regulator closes and trips off the chlorine feed to the injection system.  Chlorine is injected for 15 minutes eight times per day.  Four one-ton chlorine cylinders will be connected via a common header system to minimize the number of times that chlorine cylinders have to be delivered to the plant and hooked up to the chlorination system.  The chlorine cylinders are stored at the Screen House and are checked by the Water Treatment Operators each shift.  \n\nThe importance of preventing any releases is stressed through on-the-job training for employees entering job responsibilities in this work area.  All plant employees are required to review the chlorine safety training materials annually."
