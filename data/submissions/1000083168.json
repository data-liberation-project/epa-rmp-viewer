Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies :  CENTAURI Technologies, LP produces variable specialty chemical products used in multiple industries.  Two of these products are specialty amines, one which uses Methylamine as a raw material  Thise raw material, in the amounts handled in our facility, are considered hazardous by the EPA.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  CENTAURI Technologies manages the safety of the regulated process by means of operating procedures, equipment testing and inspections, safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and other controls and systems designed to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals.  Safe work practices and training of personnel supplement the inherent safe design of the plant.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is based upon OSHA's HAZWOPER regulation.  The emergency response plan includes procedures for the notification of the local fire authority and Hazardous Material unit so that appropriate measures can be taken by local emergency responders to control accidental releases.\n\n\n\nThis document has been prepared in accordance with the EPA's Risk Management Plan regulation (40 CFR, Part 68).  The substance and process considered during the preparation of this RMP and the scenarios described were selected based on criteria established in the regulation.\n\n\n\n2.    The stationary source and regulated substance handled :  The primary purpose of this facility is the production of specialty chemical products.  CENTAURI receives bulk Methylamine as a raw material and unloads the material into pressurized liquid storage.  The Methylamine is then fed continuously from storage into a reaction system where it is mixed with another reactive species to form the specialty amine product.  Excess methylamine is removed from the reaction system effluent by a distillation process and recycled back into t"

      "SummaryText": "he bulk liquid methylamine storage tank.  The maximum amount of this substance at this facility would be 32,000 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The worst-case release scenario (WCS) : The worst case scenario, defined by the EPA, associated with Methylamine (flammable substance) at this facility is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) involving the maximum inventory of the methylamine storage tank.  A full vessel inventory of 32,000 pounds is assumed to be released and ignite, resulting in a VCE.  The maximum distance to the EPA defined endpoint of 1 psi overpressure does not reach receptors off-site (distance to endpoint 0.09 miles).  CENTAURI has active controls directed at preventing such releases and controlling the consequences, and no credit for active mitigation measures were taken into account in evaluating this WCS.\n\n\n\n4.    The general accidental release prevention program and specific prevention steps :  The facility developed prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Plan and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation.  This facility was designed and constructed to comply with applicable state and industry codes.\n\n\n\n5.    Five year accident history :  This facility came on line in September of 2001.  In the last five years, there have been no accidents involving or accidental releases of methylamine, propylene oxide or dimethylamine that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n\n\n6.    The emergency response program :  All facility employees have been trained to OSHA's HAZWOPER, First Responder Awareness Level in order to identify the need for an initiated response.  Retraining is conducted annually.\n\n\n\n    The facility maintains a Release Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan that contains specific procedures for employees to take in the event of an emergency or accidental release.

Planned changes to improve safety :  The facility resolves recommendations from PHAs and Incident Investigations, some of which may result in modifications to the plant design and operation procedures.\n\n"
