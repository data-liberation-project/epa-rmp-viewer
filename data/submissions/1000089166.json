Emergency response equipment in the plant is routinely inspected and maintained to ensure a state of readiness, and is summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nEmergency Vehicles\r\nAmbulance\r\nHAZMAT Truck\r\nFire Truck\r\nMobile Emergency Control Center\r\nRescue Truck\r\nRescue Boat\r\n\r\nEmergency Trailers\r\nHAZ MAT Trailer\r\nPCl3 Foam Trailer \r\nFire Fighting Foam Trailer\r\nAir Bottle Trailer\r\n\r\nAll of this equipment is maintained in the Fire Bay, except that the fire fighting foam trailer is maintained in the Emergency Equipment Bay (also known as the Project Warehouse).\r\n\r\nOther equipment is placed throughout the plant for quick response and includes (but is not limited to) fire hose houses and monitors, sprinkler and deluge systems, spill response kits, absorbent materials, Industrial Hygiene monitoring equipment, bunker gear, SCBAs and other equipment.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety:\r\nOver the next 5 years the plant plans to continue to improve safety through continuation of participation in programs such as VPP, continuing internal initiatives such as the Behavior Based Safety program, as well as conducting audits required by PSM and RMP.\r\n\r\nThis brief summary provides some insight into the extensive system Bayer utilizes to maintain safe operations.

      "SummaryText": "y Evaluations:\r\nThe Luling site utilizes an outside company (ISN) to screen, continuously review, and provide safety data to Bayer on all existing and potential contractors and their individual employees.  These evaluations are completed continuously for all contractors within their network; Bayer only uses contractors / vendors that have been screened using this service; and the database is reviewed prior to allowing any new contractors to perform work on-site.  Work-In-Progress (WIP) audits of each contractor regardless of the facility they work for are entered into the ISN database and available to all potential companies that are looking to use this contractor.  Therefore, Bayer can evaluate each contractor and their individual employees on a continuous basis with data from numerous facilities / plants / sites in the area.  This evaluation service (ISN) and their review, coupled with on-site safety department's periodic WIP and annual evaluations, ensured that contractor safety performance at the Luling site is maintained at a high level.\r\n\r\nFive-Year Accident History:\r\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no RMP-defined accidental release events.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\nIn accordance with the revised provisions of the RMP and PSM rules, Bayer's Luling facility has a documented Emergency Response Plan that includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of potential events such as inclement weather, fire, and toxic chemical releases.  Personnel responsible for implementing this procedure are available onsite at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) and other appropriate organizations. \r\n\r\nThe following actions take place in the event of an emergency:\r\n\r\n-\tDEP is notified immediately;\r\n-\tPlant person"

These procedures are developed and reviewed with active involvement from operating personnel, and are certified annually.\r\n\r\n-\tA change management system is utilized for changes in equipment, operating parameters, and personnel.  Each change is appropriately reviewed by a team of personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\r\n\r\n-\tThe site utilizes a number of contract personnel for a variety of services. Our Contractor/Guest program requires that contractors be selected using their actual safety performance as a criteria, and open communication exists between Bayer and contract employees to identify and control hazards.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we utilize a number of systems for specific chemicals.  Examples include:\r\n\r\n-\tProcess alarms and interlocks,\r\n-\tArea monitors to quickly detect leaks,\r\n-\tWater sprinkler systems to extinguish process fires, and\r\n-\tExcess flow valves which will stop chlorine flow under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nBoth the general and chemical specific systems work together to minimize the frequency and consequences of chemical releases.\r\n\r\nPeriodic Compliance Auditing:\r\nPeriodic compliance auditing is conducted through both the Environmental and Process Safety Management groups.  Auditing that reviews the elements of the RMP program are conducted in both of these programs.  The last full corporate compliance audit was conducted in 2017.  The latest full corporate compliance audit was started in 2020 as a virtual inspection due to the pandemic and associated travel / meeting restrictions.  It is not expected to conclude until later in 2020 when these restrictions have been lifted.  However, an additional corporate compliance audit was conducted in 2019 as a supplemental review of the 2017 findings and was completed by the Bayer corporate personnel to gauge compliance on an interim basis before the 2020 full audit was to be performed.\r\n\r\nContractor Safet"

Therefore, the facility is adding this chemical to the site's RMP program in 2020 as an added safety initiative that shows the company's commitment to safety and the environment.\r\n\r\nThis Risk Management Plan report is being updated in response to changes in facility information in Section 1, expanded worse case and alternate release scenarios for greater transparency, and Bayer is also taking this opportunity to conduct the full five year review of the plan as required by the regulations.  It is noted that the official transition from Monsanto to Bayer has occurred in August 2020.  The DUNS number provided (001350263) is for the United States corporate entity of Bayer Crop Science LP.  The previous Monsanto Company, Luling Facility DUNS was 001700756 and has been discontinued.  The Bayer Crop Science, Luling Site DUNS number has not been issued at this time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\r\nThe Luling plant is also subject to the provisions of the OSHA PSM regulation, whose provisions align closely with the major RMP prevention program elements.  Accordingly, the Luling Plant employs a comprehensive collection of safety systems to maintain the equipment and work practices utilized in our operation to comply with these rules.  Some examples include:\r\n\r\n-\tA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted at a minimum of every 5 years.  This involves a team of experts who review the hazards posed by the chemical, best industry practices for handling the material, and a defined system to identify hazards.  Recommendations for improvement are made, and priority is placed on implementing them in a prompt manner.\r\n\r\n-\tOur mechanical integrity system requires regular inspection of the equipment, relief devices, and other systems utilized in handling regulated materials.\r\n\r\n-\tInstructions"
