      "SummaryText": "RMP Executive Summary:\n\nBayer CropScience LP, Luling Plant\n\nLDEQ Agency Interest Number: 1096\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:\n\nBayer CropScience LP (Bayer) is an agricultural company.  We apply innovation and technology to help farmers around the world produce more while conserving more.  We help farmers grow yield sustainably so they can be successful, produce healthier foods, better animal feeds and more fiber, while also reducing agriculture's impact on our environment.\n\n\n\nTo facilitate these efforts, Bayer (formerly Monsanto Company) developed a \"Pledge\" several years ago.  This Pledge is our commitment to how we do business.  It is a declaration that compels us to listen more, to consider our actions and their impact broadly, and to lead responsibly.  It helps us to convert our values into actions, and to make clear who we are and what we champion.  One aspect of the Pledge is \"Respect\", which states: \"The safety of our employees, the communities where we operate, our customers, consumers, and the environment will be our highest priority.\"  Thus, Bayer's strong commitment to chemical safety begins at the upper level of the company.\n\n\n\nThis commitment extends to Bayer's chemical manufacturing facilities, including the Luling facility.  As evidence of this strong commitment, the Luling Plant received certification as a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) \"Star\" site in 1994, and has continuously retained this rating since then.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Handled:\n\nThe Bayer Luling facility is located in St. Charles Parish in Louisiana at 12501 River Road, Luling.  The facility manufactures Roundup(c) brand herbicide and ACL(c) brand active chlorine.  As part of its operations, the facility handles sufficient quantities of Chlorine, Formaldehyde, Phosphorus Trichloride (PCl3), and Isopropylamine (IPA) to make it subject to EPA's Risk Management Program rule.

Therefore, the facility is adding this chemical to the site's RMP program in 2020 as an added safety initiative that shows the company's commitment to safety and the environment.\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan report is being updated in response to changes in facility information in Section 1, expanded worse case and alternate release scenarios for greater transparency, and Bayer is also taking this opportunity to conduct the full five year review of the plan as required by the regulations.  It is noted that the official transition from Monsanto to Bayer has occurred in August 2020.  The DUNS number provided (001350263) is for the United States corporate entity of Bayer Crop Science LP.  The previous Monsanto Company, Luling Facility DUNS was 001700756 and has been discontinued.  The Bayer Crop Science, Luling Site DUNS number has not been issued at this time.\n\n\n\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe Luling plant is also subject to the provisions of the OSHA PSM regulation, whose provisions align closely with the major RMP prevention program elements.  Accordingly, the Luling Plant employs a comprehensive collection of safety systems to maintain the equipment and work practices utilized in our operation to comply with these rules.  Some examples include:\n\n\n\n-    A Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) is conducted at a minimum of every 5 years.  This involves a team of experts who review the hazards posed by the chemical, best industry practices for handling the material, and a defined system to identify hazards.  Recommendations for improvement are made, and priority is placed on implementing them in a prompt manner.\n\n\n\n-    Our mechanical integrity system requires regular inspection of the equipment, relief devices, and other systems utilized in handling regulated materials.\n\n\n\n-    Instructions "

These procedures are developed and reviewed with active involvement from operating personnel, and are certified annually.\n\n\n\n-    A change management system is utilized for changes in equipment, operating parameters, and personnel.  Each change is appropriately reviewed by a team of personnel to determine if there is any impact to system safety.\n\n\n\n-    The site utilizes a number of contract personnel for a variety of services. Our Contractor/Guest program requires that contractors be selected using their actual safety performance as a criteria, and open communication exists between Bayer and contract employees to identify and control hazards.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we utilize a number of systems for specific chemicals.  Examples include:\n\n\n\n-    Process alarms and interlocks,\n\n-    Area monitors to quickly detect leaks,\n\n-    Water sprinkler systems to extinguish process fires, and\n\n-    Excess flow valves which will stop chlorine flow under certain conditions.\n\n\n\nBoth the general and chemical specific systems work together to minimize the frequency and consequences of chemical releases.\n\n\n\nPeriodic Compliance Auditing:\n\nPeriodic compliance auditing is conducted through both the Environmental and Process Safety Management groups.  Auditing that reviews the elements of the RMP program are conducted in both of these programs.  The last full corporate compliance audit was conducted in 2017.  The latest full corporate compliance audit was started in 2020 as a virtual inspection due to the pandemic and associated travel / meeting restrictions.  It is not expected to conclude until later in 2020 when these restrictions have been lifted.  However, an additional corporate compliance audit was conducted in 2019 as a supplemental review of the 2017 findings and was completed by the Bayer corporate personnel to gauge compliance on an interim basis before the 2020 full audit was to be performed.\n\n\n\nContractor Safet"

      "SummaryText": "y Evaluations:\n\nThe Luling site utilizes an outside company (ISN) to screen, continuously review, and provide safety data to Bayer on all existing and potential contractors and their individual employees.  These evaluations are completed continuously for all contractors within their network; Bayer only uses contractors / vendors that have been screened using this service; and the database is reviewed prior to allowing any new contractors to perform work on-site.  Work-In-Progress (WIP) audits of each contractor regardless of the facility they work for are entered into the ISN database and available to all potential companies that are looking to use this contractor.  Therefore, Bayer can evaluate each contractor and their individual employees on a continuous basis with data from numerous facilities / plants / sites in the area.  This evaluation service (ISN) and their review, coupled with on-site safety department's periodic WIP and annual evaluations, ensured that contractor safety performance at the Luling site is maintained at a high level.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n\nDuring the past 5 years, there have been no RMP-defined accidental release events.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program:\n\nIn accordance with the revised provisions of the RMP and PSM rules, Bayer's Luling facility has a documented Emergency Response Plan that includes defined responsibilities and actions to be implemented for a number of potential events such as inclement weather, fire, and toxic chemical releases.  Personnel responsible for implementing this procedure are available onsite at all times.  In general, the plan describes actions which result in a safe response for company employees as well as prompt notification of community organizations.  The plan has been integrated with the St. Charles Parish Department of Emergency Preparedness (DEP) and other appropriate organizations. \n\n\n\nThe following actions take place in the event of an emergency:\n\n\n\n-    DEP is notified immediately;\n\n-    Plant person"
