This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes.  Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, facility trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe Houston Gas Plant processes raw gas from a field gathering system.  Produced natural gas is brought into the plant where it is first dehydrated to remove water.  The gas is then sent through refrigeration dew point control units where the condensable liquids will be extracted from the methane gas stream.  The gas is then sent through the turbo expander for additional pressure drop and liquids removal.  After passing through the turbo expander both the gas and liquids are sent to the deethanizer tower through different inlet trays.  The gas rises through the top and is ready to be sent into the sales pipeline.  The liquids are separated and sent through the bottom and to the surge tank and depropanzier.  A fractionator process then takes the B-G liquids and separates the iso- and normal- butane leaving natural gasoline.  \n\nLiquids are brought into the plant at the slug catchers and then are taken to the stabilizer where they are heated and separated, with the gas going back into the inlet process as described above.  The liquids are introduced into a depropanizer for separation into propane and B-G mixes.  Additional liquids will be brought into the plant and stored in Y-grade tanks for storage prior to entering the stabilizer and the remainder of the process.  \n\nA fractionator process then takes the B-G liquids "

An accounting of the various storage tanks, flammable mixture compositions, and determination of worst-case scenario is given following the PSM information below.\n\nFor additional detail of the various processes at the Houston Plant see the plant operations manager.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION \nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention in place for the process at the facility. Because the process at the facility that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) risk management program (RMP) regulation are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) process safety management (PSM) standard, this summary addresses each of the OSHA PSM elements and describes the management system in place to implement accident prevention.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information.  The reference documents are maintained on file at the facility to provide open access.\n\nChemical-specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations, is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDSs).

For the process, the facility has documented safety-related limits for specific process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition) in key process parameter documents.  The facility ensures that the process is maintained within these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained personnel, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems).\n\nThe facility also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, and electrical rating of equipment.  This information, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the process are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.  \n\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., will use one or more of the following techniques to identify hazards: what-if, checklist, what-if/checklist, hazard and operability (HAZOP), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), or fault tree analysis (FTA).  HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques and will be utilized for each major process change or renovation.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates haza"

Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned that highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the facility periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the process is no longer operative.  The results and findings from these updates are documented and retained.  Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.  \n\nOperating Procedures\n\nMarkWest Energy Partners L.P., maintains written procedures that address various modes of operations, such as: unit startup; normal operations; temporary operations; emergency shutdown; normal shutdown; emergency operations, and initial startup of a new process.

Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors: perform their work in a safe manner; have the appropriate knowledge and skills; are aware of the hazards in their workplace; understand what they should do in event of an emergency; understand and follow site safety rules; and inform facility personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with: a process overview; information about potential fire, explosion, or toxic release hazards; emergency response plan requirements; and safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, the Houston Gas Plant will only select contractors who submit certification that employees are trained in specifics and safe work practices associated with their job, and that provide safety performance documentation from the previous three years.  Finally, facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nCHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThe processes at the Houston Gas Plant have hazards that must be managed to ensure continued safe operation.

Personal protective equipment (e.g., chemical protective clothing).\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nThe Houston Gas Plant has had no accidents since its inception within the past 5 years.    \n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM INFORMATION\n\nThe Houston Gas Plant maintains a written emergency response program, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition,"

      "SummaryText": " the facility has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to facility processes.  The emergency response program changes are administered through the MOC process, which includes informing and/or training affected personnel in the changes. Periodic drills or tabletop exercises are conducted to test the response plan.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Houston Gas Plant is coordinated with the Washington County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.  The Houston Gas Plant has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Houston Gas Plant conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and the facility provides annual refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the facility.  \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Houston Gas Plant resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  At this time there are no findings to report.\n\n\nCALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE QUANTITY AND WORST- AND ALTERNATE-CASE SCENARIOS\nTanks Included in the Plan\nForward looking statements account for Pad #1-Pad #4 to be completely built out and the slug catchers to be completely built out.

This was chosen because while the weight of flammable material in a slug catcher is less than other scenarios, the other tanks are nearby the propane tanks, whereas the slug catchers are on a different side of the plant and may have a different sphere of influence.\n\nMethane Calculation:\nB-G tanks - 0%\nY-grade tanks - 0%\nSlug catchers tanks - 15.687%\nNatural gasoline tanks - 0%\nSlug catcher max:  19,900 gal x 80% x 15.687% x 0.446 sg x 8.34 l"
