      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis RMP has been developed by Belews Creek Steam Station (BCSS), a Duke Energy site, in order to comply with the standards established by the EPA's Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention (40 CFR Part 68). \r\n\r\nPLANT AND PROCESS INFORMATION\r\n\r\nBCSS operates an Anhydrous Ammonia (NH3) system as a component supporting the station's Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of the plant's boiler emissions. NH3 vapor, in the presence of the SCR catalyst, is used to reduce NOx compounds to nitrogen and water, in order to reduce the total NOx effluent emitted from the plant.\r\n\r\nThe NH3 system is comprised of six storage tanks, with three belonging to U1, and the other three to Unit 2. The station's Maximum Intended Inventory (MII) is < 645,000 gallons or 3,321,750 pounds. The MII includes the storage tanks and piping directly connected to the covered process and the rail cars on site, but, not directly connected to the covered process. This total quantity of NH3 exceeds the EPA's threshold quantity (TQ), which requires the station to comply with their Program 3 regulations. \r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION MEASURES\r\n\r\nBCSS is committed to public and employee safety, continued reliable operation, and regulatory compliance. Based on this commitment, the station manager has overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program. A management system has been developed through the station's Accident Prevention Plan (APP), which clearly defines how this program complies with the OSHA PSM Standard and EPA RMP Rule. To ensure that no serious NH3 releases occur, BCSS maintains a release prevention program, which is focused on protecting the public and station employees from the hazards associated with an accident or release. This multifaceted program includes the use of: Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) to evaluate chemical and process hazards and make recommendations for safety improvements; NH3 detection"
