      "SummaryText": "The Northern Star Company is a vegetable processing plant located at 3171 5th Street S.E., Minneapolis, MN. Anhydrous Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at this facility to provide cooling for production and storage areas. The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia in the system at any one time is estimated at 24,900 pounds.\n\nWorst-case Release Scenario for a Toxic Release\nThe Northern Star Company worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The maximum capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is 26,400 pounds. The normal operating level in the HPR is 15,840 pounds, so the worst-case release scenario takes in account the possibility the vessel would be 80% full holding 21,120 pounds. In calculating the area affected by this failure, the engine room enclosure, where the HPR is located, will provide passive mitigation, there by reducing the toxic endpoint of the release. The engine room has a continuous air ventilation of 2,640 cfm and an emergency ventilation in excess of 20,000 cfm. This allows for minimum of 7 air changes per hour in the engine room. Using the RMP Comp program downloaded from the EPA Home Page the calculated toxic endpoint was 0.6 miles down wind. Based on the census data provided the population within the radius of the toxic endpoint is 15,832, with two schools, residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses and some recreational areas. There are no hospitals located within the area.\n\nThe worst-case release is the catastrophic failure of the High Pressure Receiver in the ammonia system. The vessel capacity of the High Pressure Receiver is described above. Although the worst case scenario is a requirement by the RMP ruling it is not a likely scenario to take place. Northern Star Company follows the industrial standards to assure proper material is used in the ammonia refrigeration system. By following the industrial standards and the EPA / OSHA standards the shell failure unlikely.\n\nANSI"

The alternative release was a pressure relief valve function or failure was the most likely cause of an ammonia release. Using the tables provided a pressure relief valve release of 10 minutes releasing 130lbs/mn from the High Pressure Receiver. The toxic endpoint for the release would be .10 miles down wind. The estimated population within the distance would be 350 people. There is also one school, some residential housing, retail and light industrial businesses. There are no hospitals in the area.\n\nAccidental Release and Emergency response Policies:\nThe Northern Star Company has established steps to include initial training under the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.120 HAZWOPER. The facility has also established annual retraining for all personnel that are on the HAZMAT Team as well as periodic spill drills and plant wide evacuation drills to assure all employees are prepared in the event of an ammonia release.

The trained personnel have been trained at the level of the Technician Level Responder and also the Incident Commander on scene. The trained personnel will assess each release situation and determine by the risk assessment the appropriate emergency response to initiate. This could be by simply tightening a packing nut or a flange bolt or initiating a system shut down. Northern Star Company has established a written operating procedure for the ammonia system and has included in the procedure the Emergency Shutdown and Isolation in the event of a release.
