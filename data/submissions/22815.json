This vehicle is equipped with Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, Gloves, Safety Glasses, Class A tyvack Chemical Response Suits.  WVSA has personnel trained in Hazardous Material response and specializaton in chlorine.  The Medical care system at the WVSA consists of three (3) on staff Emergency Medical Technicians.  If required, the assistance of the local ambulance as well as local hospitals will be requested.  The clean up of the chlorine is to allow the residue to dissipate; therefore no clean up or recycling capabilities are necessary.  Also a scubber that is electrically activated is hooked up to the the chlorine facitlity and is automatically started if a leak were to occur.  WVSA chlorine suppliers have trained all personnel that work with the chlorine system in the safety, and proper procedures of working with the handling of chlorine."
