The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nThis facility has had no accidental releases in the last five years which meets the criteria set forth in 40 CFR 68.10.\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Petal NGL Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect worker and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.   \n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Petal NGL Terminal is coordinated with the Forrest and Lamar Counties Local Emergency Management District (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Petal NGL Terminal has around-the- clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the Petal NGL Terminal conducts periodic emergency drills that involve the LEPC and emergency response organizations, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of reg"

In addition, a written safety program designed to comply with all applicable OSHA safety performance regulations is strictly enforced at all Enterprise facilities, including the Petal NGL Terminal facility.  As part of the Enterprise safety program, the facility utilizes procedures that are included in the Enterprise program, but may not specifically be required at non-PSM and/or RMP Program 1 facilities (e.g. Safe work practice training; safe work permitting and hot work permitting).\n\nUniversal Prevention Activities\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all RMP covered processes at Petal NGL Terminal.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and human errors.\n\nSpecialized Safety Features\n\nThe Petal NGL Terminal has safety features on many units to help contain/control a release, to quickly detect a release and reduce the consequence of a release.  The following types of safety features are used in the covered processes:\n\nRelease Detection\n\n* Hydrocarbon (hazardous gas) detectors and alarms\n* Terminal video surveillance system\n\nRelease Containment and Control\n\n* Process relief valves that discharge to a flare to capture and incinerate episodic releases\n* Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n* Automatic shutdown systems for specific process parameters (e.g., high pressure).\n* Secondary containment (curbs and dikes) to contain any release of liquid chemicals\n* Redundant equipment and instrumentation where advisable\n* Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n* Hand-held fire extinguishers\n* Deluge system and fire water monitors\n* Diesel fire water pump and fire water system\n*"

The propane and commercial butane, along with a relatively pure liquid ethane product, are handled by the nearby Petal Storage Facility. The ethane is received from PHMSA regulated pipelines, sent to storage in an underground liquid storage well, and is returned to PHMSA regulated pipelines from storage.  The ethane, propane and commercial butane stored at Petal is in storage incident to PHMSA pipeline transportation and is exempt from the EPA Risk Management Program regulation. Up to 1,200 gallons of ethyl mercaptan is also stored at the facility for use as an odorant in rail car and transport truck propane shipments.  The quantity of ethyl mercaptan in storage is at all times less than the 10,000 pound threshold quantity specified in the EPA RMP regulation.\n\nThe Petal NGL Terminal is regulated by Federal OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119 and 40 CFR Part 68.  We have entered the facility as an RMP Program Level 1 facility.\n\nToxics\n\nThere are no toxic materials contained on site above the threshold limits.\n\nFlammables\n\nThe Petal NGL Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable substances exceeded the threshold quantity.  Listed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Petal NGL Terminal are propane and commercial butane.\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.
