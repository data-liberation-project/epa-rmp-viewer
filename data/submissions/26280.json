This Executive Summary includes a discussion of the various Risk Management Program elements as follows:\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n2. Stationary source activities\n3. Regulated substances handled\n4. Worst-case and alternative release scenarios\n5. General and chemical-specific accidental release prevention program\n6. Five-year accident history\n7. Emergency response program\n8. Planned changes to improve safety\n9. Summary\n\n\n1.  Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nIt is General Mills' policy to comply with all of the requirements of the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Program regulation as well as all other applicable Federal and State rules and regulations. The Lithonia Plant has developed an OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Manual  that documents safety and risk management policies pertaining to the prevention of accidental releases and emergency response. In addition to the PSM Manual, the Lithonia Plant has developed a Risk Management Program that includes the OSHA PSM elements, a description of the risk management system, the Offsite Consequence Analysis (OCA), and the five-year accident history. \n\n\n2.  Stationary Source Activities\n\nThe Lithonia Plant is located in Dekalb County, Georgia. The plant was previously owned and operated by the Pillsbury Company and was acquired by General Mills, Inc. effective October 31, 2001.  The facility produces frozen products, such as cookies and pie shells. The products are frozen and stored in a frozen goods warehouse prior to shipment. Ammonia is used to provide refrigeration for freezing and for frozen finished goods storage. \n\n\n3.  Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe ammonia for the refrigeration system at the Lithonia Plant is a regulated substance under the EPA's Risk Management Program rule. The ammonia system is a closed loop which recirculates and reuses th"

The system consists of compressors, receivers, evaporators and condensers and has a maximum intended inventory of 26,000 pounds of ammonia.\n\n\n4.  Worst-Case and Alternative Release Scenarios\n\nFor the worst case and alternative release scenarios, the EPA Model Risk Management Program and Plan for Ammonia Refrigeration (May 1996), the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines for Ammonia Refrigeration (1998) and the EPA Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998) were used for guidance. The Ammonia Guidance tables were used to derive the hazard distances for worst-case and alternative release scenarios. \n\nReleasing the contents of  the High Pressure Receiver in the condenser area which can contain up to 15,000 pounds (87.5% at 95F) of ammonia represents the worst-case scenario. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.  The alternative release scenario was chosen as a quarter-inch hole, which would be representative of a pump seal leak or a gasket rupture. The resulting distance to the endpoint also extends offsite, and public receptors immediately adjacent to the facility are within the distance to the endpoint\n\nDiscussion\nThe results included in this analysis indicate that the worst-case release for the ammonia process can extend offsite and reach public receptors. However, it is important to emphasize that a worst-case release is extremely unlikely to occur because of the many safety features inherent in the design and operational systems for the plant. \n\nOn the other hand, the alternative release scenario is based on credible assumptions. The alternative scenario was selected from a number of possible scenarios, based on their potential to reach offsite. As mentioned in the Amm"

Prevention Programs\n\nFor the Lithonia Plant ammonia system, General Mills followed the ANSI/IIAR 2-1992 Standard for Equipment, Design, and Installation of Ammonia Mechanical Refrigeration Systems and implemented an RMP Program 3 Prevention Program which is equivalent to the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program. This is one of the most important ways for preventing ammonia releases and for minimizing the impacts of any release that does occur. Some of the key elements of the Prevention Program are summarized below. \n\nProcess Safety Information(PSI) - A comprehensive set of process safety information has been compiled for the ammonia system. The PSI includes data on the chemicals, the equipment and the technology of the process.\n\nProcess Hazards Analysis (PHA)- A total system PHA was conducted in 1998. Recommendations made by the PHA team to improve the safety of the systems have been addressed.  In August 2001, a PHA was conducted for the installation of the  evaporators. Recommendations for that PHA have been completed.\n\nOperating Procedures - An Operations and Maintenance Manual provides detailed written operating procedures for the ammonia system and for safe work practices. \n\nTraining - Training is provided to each operator and maintenance person before they are certified to operate the system. \n\nMaintenance - All of the covered ammonia equipment is included in the Lithonia preventive maintenance program. Equipment inspections, testing and preventive maintenance activities are performed following a structured schedule according to IIAR Bulletin 109.\n\nManagement of Change (MOC) - An MOC procedure has been developed and is implemented for all changes made to the ammonia system, including the safety systems. \n\nPre-startup Review (PSR)- Pre-startup reviews are conducted whenever a change results in a change to the PSI. Checklists are used to direct the PSR proce"

The checklists are used to ensure that all essential elements of the prevention program (i.e., engineered systems and documentation) were in place prior to startup. \n\nCompliance Audits - Compliance audits have been conducted, the latest in May 2001. Findings from the audit have been  addressed.\n\nIncident Investigation - General Mills routinely investigates any ammonia related incident or accident that occurs at the Lithonia Plant. An Incident Investigation procedure has been developed to help the investigation team determine the root cause of an incident and to help them develop measures to prevent recurrence. \n\nEmployee Participation - An employee participation program (for safety and risk management) is in place and training in PSM has been conducted for all affected employees. Employee involvement in PHA studies and review of operating procedures is an important way in which employees take and retain ownership of the risk management programs. \n\nHot Work Permit Program - A hot work permit program is being used at the Lithonia Plant whenever hot work is conducted in and around the ammonia systems. \n\nContractor Safety - Contractor safety procedures have been developed and implemented.\n\n\n6.  Five-Year Accident History\n\nIn the last five years there has been one  release of ammonia from the Lithonia Plant that meets the RMP reporting criteria. During the incident which occurred on 11/12/99, a maintenance employee was injured.  There were no offsite injuries or impacts.\n\n\n7.  Emergency Response Program\n\nThe Lithonia Plant has an emergency response program, which is described, in the site Emergency Response Plan (ERP). This plan includes procedures for evacuations, notifying response agencies and adjacent businesses, emergency equipment list with maintenance schedule, and procedures for responding to any release that may occur. The plan also includes first aid procedures for toxic exposures to ammonia. The ERP is coordinated with the Dekalb County Fire Services and t"

A public communications meeting was held on May 27, 1999 in cooperation with the Dekalb County Fire Services and the Dekalb County Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\n8.  Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nAll recommendations from previous PHAs, MOCs, and PSRs are being addressed. However, it is General Mills policy to review operating, maintenance and emergency response procedures on a routine basis to ensure they are always applicable. This continuous review process does generate further recommendations for improved safety during the course of operations, but these measures are typically addressed in a very short time frame. \n\n\n9.  Summary\n\nThe design, operation and maintenance of the ammonia system according to IIAR Standards and Guidelines and the implementation of the PSM and RMP programs provide a high level of assurance that the hazards and risks associated with the use of ammonia are being managed in an appropriate manner. The likelihood of a release is minimized through the implementation of these programs. General Mills has developed an Emergency Response Plan that is coordinated through the local response agencies and has communicated the information in this Risk Management Plan to the local community."
