The Emergency Action Plan is detailed in the Emergency Planning and Response section of this PSM/RMP document. This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n  1.  To save lives.\r\n  2.  To minimize and avoid injuries.\r\n  3.  To protect the environment.\r\n  4.  To minimize property damage.\r\n\r\nThe emergency action procedures provide the reporting and notification procedures, evacuation procedures, and Mitigation procedures that may be implemented to ensure operators respond effectively to an emergency situation. This manual is distributed to all plant personnel upon initial employment and is readily available at the facility.\r\n\r\nB. STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\r\nThe Americold Plant #80570 facility is located at 660 Fifth Street in Turlock, California.  The facility is situated at the intersection of Firth Street and F Street, approximately one half-mile south of West Main Street. The immediate area is primarily industrial and commercial with residential areas primarily to the north and west.\r\n\r\nThe facility chills and stores a variety of food products such as fruit, fish, and poultry.  The facility operates the ammonia refrigeration system to maintain appropriate temperatures for storing these food products. The facility was originally built in 1953 Between 1956 and 1989 several additional cold storage rooms and an Instant Quick Freeze were added to increase freezing and storage capacity.  The facility currently covers approximately 6.3 acres.\r\n\r\nAmmonia in this facility exceeds the Threshold Quantity for Accidental Release prevention. The majority of the system is located in the engine room including vessels and compressors.  The condensers are mounted on the engine room roof, the diffuser is located outside the engine room, and all of the evaporators are located in their respective cold stor"
