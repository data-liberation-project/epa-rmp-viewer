Two one ton chlorine cylinders are attached to the vacuum demand chlorine regulator system; one is valved in service, the other isolated by cylinder valve.  The chlorination system is maintained at a slight vacuum, which allows the regulator to supply chlorine on demand.  This system isolates the distribution system from the cylinder should a leak occur. \n\nThe Worst Case Scenario was the full release of a one ton cylinder as modeled in RMP Comp.  The design feature of the Vacuum demand chlorine system makes the selection of the Alternate Release Scenario a leak or pipe failure at the regulator attachment point to the cylinder.  The potential consequences and end point were determined again using RMP Comp.\n\nTo minimize the risk of these events, procedures are in place to ensure the integrity of cylinders being delivered and stored on site.  The procedure to change cylinders is posted in the storage area and employees have observed demonstrations during their probationary periods and have been observed performing the evolution during the same period.  All operators are required to earn at least a Class III Louisiana Water Treatment Certification.  During preparation for the certification examination, the hazards associated with chlorine are covered in the training manuals.\n\nIn the event of a release with the potential for off-site release, the chlorine emergency plan requires the operator to notify the Emergency Operations Center in St. Charles Parish.  The Department of Emergency Preparedness will coordinate the necessary emergency response activities.  \n\n\n"
