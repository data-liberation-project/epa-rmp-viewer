If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department and law enforcement personnel to mitigate any release to the population and the environment of our community.\n\n2.  Facility Information:  This is a new facility.  The primary activity at this location is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received and stored while awaiting delivery to the farmers.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia stored at this facililty is approximately 152,200 pounds.  This amount includes our main storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worst-Case Release Scenario:  The worst-case  release scenario would be the release of the total contents of  our main storage tank.  The quantity released would be approximately 130,100 pounds of anhydrous ammonia.  The distance to the endpoint would be approximately 4.4 miles\n\n4.  Alternative-Case Release Scenario:  The alternative-case release scenario is a release from a transfer hose failure.  The distance to the endpoint is approximately 0.3 miles.\n\n5.  Accidental  Release Prevention Program:  The facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the Standard of the U. S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,\n\n6.  Five Year Accident History:  There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\n7.  Emergency Response Program:  Our facility has coordina"
