The rule requires facilities to provide an executive summary of the following information:\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\nPain Enterprises has developed and implemented a spill prevention control & countermeasure (SPCC) plan, an emergency action plan (EAP), and a process safety management (PSM) plan as part of its accidental release / emergency response program. The programs involve a range of senior management personnel (including local production and management personnel and Pain's Corporate Safety Director). Additionally, Pain conducts regular safety meetings and training involving many levels of personnel. Pain's policies and procedures are outlined in the respective plans. Pain's corporate policy is to inspect, maintain and operate equipment and facilities to prevent accidents (including release of hazardous materials) and to train employees in prevention, as well as to prepare them to respond rapidly and effectively should an accident occur.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances Handled - Refrigeration (anhydrous ammonia)\nAmmonia is used in the production of dry ice (CO2). The facility operates a closed loop anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system with a total storage capacity of approximately 18,000 pounds. The majority of the refrigeration components are located in the main manufacturing facility, with the exception of the condensers located outside the facility.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\nThe Pain facility maintains a Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals plan prepared in accordance with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulation 29 CFR 1910.119. Pain also utilizes a preventative maintenance program for its syst"

As part of this program, maintenance personnel inspect the refrigeration system operating parameters and monitoring system regularly.\n\nFive-year Accident History\nThere have been no accidents involving ammonia at this facility nor any off-site consequence that have resulted in death, injury, property damage, evacuation, environmental damage or sheltering in place.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nPain has implemented an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA regulations. The facility retains an emergency response contractor to respond in the event of a hazardous material release, fire or other emergency situation. The EAP contains specific information regarding emergency organization and procedures as well as incident notification, mitigation, and incident preparedness. Pain conducts regular training including refreshers.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\nA process hazard analysis (PHA) of the process safety management (PSM) program was conducted in August 2010.  As a result numerous recommendations were made concerning improvements to administrative/engineering controls, written procedures and training.  Pain Enterprises plans to implement recommendations (as warranted) before the end of 2010/Q1 of 2011."
