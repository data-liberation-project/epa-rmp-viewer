Employees at all levels are accountable for assuring high standards of environmental, health and safety compliance and performance. Safety, health and protection of the environment will be maintained as integral aspects of all business activities.\n\n\n\nThe Richmond site has an emergency response plan that outlines the established responsibilities in the event of an emergency. The plan identifies how the local authorities, including the fire department and local emergency planning commission (LEPC), will be notified in the event of an emergency that may have off-site consequences.\n\n\n\nThis facility manufactures, packages, and stores paints, coatings and other paint-related products for the automotive and woodcare markets.  In addition, this facility manufactures resin and latex that is used as a raw material that is consumed at this site as well as shipped to other Sherwin-Williams facilities.\n\n\n\nNumerous safety systems are in place to prevent the occurrence of a release.  Practices that are in place to minimize accidental releases include task specific training, work instructions, job safety analyses, industrial hygiene monitoring programs and administrative controls including use of personal protective equipment, spill containment areas and preventive maintenance schedules.\n\n\n\nThe facility has created a Richmond Emergency Contingency Plan that incorporates guidelines for an Integrated Contingency Plan or core plan.  It consists of an internal notification structure, regulatory compliance reporting requirements, emergency coordinator responsibilities, equipment lists, incident-specific control and response actions, evacuation plan, employee training, arrangements with local authorities and disaster recovery plans.\n\n\n\nThis submittal includ"

The warehouse facility stores and distributes finished paint products produced at the plant as well as finished aerosol products that are produced elsewhere and shipped to this warehouse prior to redistribution.  Propane, butane, isobutane and methyl ether (i.e. propellants) are the RMP flammable substances stored in the finished aerosol containers stored on-site.  The Sherwin-Williams Company is submitting information regarding the storage of aerosol containers within this warehouse for compliance purposes only, and this filing shall not be construed as an agreement by Sherwin-Williams that this portion of the facility is covered by the rule.  Therefore, Sherwin-Williams reserves its right to withdraw, amend or alter this portion of the plan at any time and to refrain from any future filing under this rule.\n\n\n\nThe worst-case release scenario for a flammable material was determined by EPA to be a vapor cloud explosion.  The results were modeled using an EPA model, RMP*Comp.  This scenario assumes that the total quantity of the flammable substance in the site's largest storage vessel (an aerosol container) is released into a vapor cloud, which then explodes.  The endpoint for the impact zone was determined by EPA to be an overpressure level of 1 pound per square inch (psi) from the explosion of the vapor cloud. The release scenario evaluated does not show a potential for an offsite consequence.\n\n\n\nThere has not been an accident or incident that has met the RMP criteria involving propane, butane, isobutane or methyl ether at the facility during the last five years.  Criteria for RMP reporting are accidents that have resulted in death, injury, significant property damage, evacuation, sheltering in place, or environmental damage.  The warehouse has never had a release that caused off-site injury in its entire history.\n\n\n\nThe Richmond site trains employees at both the plant and warehouse locations to"
