The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plant operating procedures. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department. Emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated based on the results of the drill.\r\n\r\nThe emergency response program is reviewed by the Jacksonville Fire Department, which coordinates with local Duval County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and Jacksonville Fire Department HazMat Team, all located in Duval County, Florida. Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including the fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments in Atlantic Beach. Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach WTP # 1.\r\n\r\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine and sulfur dioxide spills (releases). The plan includes training of all chlorination and dechlorination-area operators. The primary response team is the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, plus the HazMat Team, who respond to severe leak situations.

An atmospheric dispersion assessment was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the toxic endpoint. The EPA-selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l or  3 parts per million (ppm). The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.
