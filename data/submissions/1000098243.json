              "Description": "1.1.2.    PREVENTION PROGRAM LEVEL 2 (a) (2)\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach maintains policies, procedures and systems as part of their prevention program.  These are applied to each treatment plant and specifically Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2.  The program addresses each of the EPA Program Level 2-listed elements, plus any RMP elements needed to implement the program, and the like elements in the plant's safety programs.  These are maintained in The City of Atlantic Beach's Document Management System (DMS).\n\n1.4.    ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM (d)\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach accidental release prevention program is based on similar elements as the OSHA PSM Prevention Program; however, being a public entity, COAB is subject to only the EPA?s RMP Level 2 prevention program.  A Prevention Program has been in place and effectively used.  It is part of the plants operating culture.  There are two parts to the program.  The first is the general overall City wide and Wastewater Treatment Plant # 2 site program.  The second is the chlorine and sulfur dioxide-specific actions within the site program.  \n\n1.4.1.    GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM   (d) (1)\n\nPlant-wide, many elements of the prevention program are used for all operations. The overviews of these programs are listed below:\n\n1) The City of Atlantic Beach has detailed process safety information on each of its operations. \n\n2) The DMS, document maintenance system, is integral to the management of change for all operations on site control.  \n\n3) Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.  Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasis awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used. \n\n4) Maintenance and preventive maintenance are used for all operations, making mechanical integrity a part of each piece of equipment. \n\n5) Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure we learn from each event as well as correct the causes of the incident. \n\n6) Employees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed below under emergency response. \n\n7)Safe work practices are used throughout the facility including:  1) Hot Work Permits, 2) Lock Out /Tag Out Permits, 3) Vessel Entry Permits, 4) Site Security, and 5) Breaking Into Chemical lines. \n\n8) Contractors must meet The City of Atlantic Beach?s high safety and technical standards as part of selection and ongoing evaluations.  Plus, the City of Atlantic Beach demands training of contractors to our standards.  \n\n1.4.2.    CHLORINE AND SULFUR DIOXIDE-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM (d) (2)\n\n1.4.2.1.    Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Specific Policies and Procedures\n\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide specific program.  These include:\n\n1) Specific procedures for the operation of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes. \n\n2) Completion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide system.  The latest one was conducted in June 2009.\n\n3) Specific emergency response procedures for chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases as outlined below under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures. \n\n4) Specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\n5) Finally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide system.\n\n1.4.2.2.    Facility Design\n\nThe plant and support equipment of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and control building meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices.  The building is equipped with ambient ventilation storage area and a fan ventilated control room.  The vent air and any fumes are diluted and then removed from the room by a vent system.  \n\n1.4.2.3.    Equipment Design\n\nThe chlorination systems and like sulfur dioxide system design has four distinct zones or types of pipe design or specification for chlorine is:\n\n1.    High pressure liquid chlorine\n\n2.    High pressure vapor chlorine\n\n3.    Vacuum pressure vapor chlorine\n\n4.    Chlorinated water liquid system.\n\nThe pipe design for sulfur dioxide is: \n\n1.    High pressure liquid S02\n\n2.    High pressure vapor S02\n\n3.    Vacuum pressure vapor S02\n\n4.    Sulfonated water liquid system.\n\nBoth the high pressure liquid and vapor systems are designed to three times the normal high pressure of the DOT shipment container.  Materials are primarily of steel construction or like materials, which are compatible with (corrosive resistant to) anhydrous chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nThe vacuum system is designed to operate at 13 inches of water vacuum pressure (less than atmospheric pressure).  The piping and fittings are made of chemical resistant PVC, glass or like materials.  The system is designated to 150 psig pressure or complete vacuum.\n\nBoth water systems are made of steel and PVC pipe, and like compatible materials.  The system is designed for chlorinated or sulfonated water at 150 psig containing low ppm levels of either chemical.\n\nAll the vessels, valves, pipe, fitting, instruments, etc. are specifically designed for either chlorine or sulfur dioxide service.\n\nThere is a dual sensor chlorine monitor in the chlorine scale feed room.   These detect the pressure of chlorine plus alarm locally and in the separate plant operation control room with a light and audible alarm.\n\nThere is a dual sensor sulfur dioxide monitor in both the sulfur dioxide scale feed room and evaporator control room.  These detect the pressure of sulfur dioxide plus alarm locally and in the separate plant operation control room with a light and audible alarm.\n\n",

The Plant includes chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and distribution systems contained in a specially designed storage and process buildings. The boundaries of the systems subject to the RMP regulation include the Bulk Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide Storage and Feed Control rooms and the associated vent make up and exhaust systems. These are detailed in the Process and Instrument Drawings (P&IDs) which are part of the plant Process Safety Information (PSI).\n\nCOAB WWTP# 1 employs five full-time employees engaged in wastewater treatment plant and field operations. Chlorine and sulfur dioxide are used as part of the treatment process.\n\n\n\n5.    REGULATED SUBSTANCES \n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are the only regulated substances on-site which exceed the 40 CFR 68 threshold quantities. The COAB chlorine and dechlorination processes were installed as part of the process of treating wastewater to meet strict FDEP discharge permit requirements.  The facility operates under permit from the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). The chlorine and sulfur dioxide are received, stored and distributed to two process control systems.  \n\n\n\nChlorine is an EPA and OSHA-listed toxic chemical. It is an irritant and it is corrosive. Chlorine is a halogen with the formula Cl2. It is a chlorinating or oxidizing agent that is not flammable.

WORST AND ALTERNATIVE CASE RELEASE SCENARIOS \n\nTwo offsite consequence analyses were conducted which include two chlorine release scenarios, since chlorine has the lower PEL.  A sulfur dioxide release would have similar consequences.  \n\n\n\nThe first is a \"worst case release\". The second is a more probable \"alternative release scenario\". The first scenario is defined by EPA, which states that \"the ... shall assume that the ... maximum quantity in the largest vessel ... is released as a gas over 10 minutes\" due to an unspecified failure.  The alternative scenario is defined as \"more likely to occur than the worst case scenario\".  An atmospheric dispersion assessment was performed to determine the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to the \"toxic endpoint.\" The EPA-selected endpoint for chlorine is 0.0087 mg/l or  3 parts per million (ppm). The 3 ppm endpoint is the Emergency Response Planning Guideline Level 2 (ERPG- 2). This is defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) as the \"maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair an individual's ability to take protective action.\" The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the toxic endpoint distance was defined, \"to estimate the population potentially affected.\"\n\na.    WORST CASE \n\nAn atmospheric dispersion assessment for the worst case scenario was performed using the EPA assumptions. Results demonstrate a distance of ____ miles to the toxic endpoint. The residential population that could potentially be affected by the release is estimated at ______ people.\n\nb.

Training is the backbone of employee knowledge, job operations and is ongoing in each area.\n\n?    Employee training in operations and maintenance emphasizes awareness of the hazardous and toxic properties of all chemicals used.\n\n?    Routine and preventive maintenance are used for each piece of equipment, with the goal of maintaining mechanical integrity. \n\n?    Incident investigations of accidents and near-miss incidents ensure that lessons are learned from each event as well as the root causes of the incident.\n\n?    Employees participate in all aspects of the plant as listed under emergency response.\n\n?    Safe work practices are used throughout the facility includin"

CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nChemical-specific prevention features of the plant include: the policies and procedures listed above and those of the chlorine- and sulfur dioxide-specific programs. These include:\n\n?    Specific procedures for the operation of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes.\n\n?    Completion of a Pre-startup Safety Review prior to startup of the modified chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.  The latest review was conducted in April 2009.\n\n?    Specific emergency response procedures for chlorine and sulfur dioxide releases as outlined under both operating procedures and in the emergency response procedures.\n\n?    Specific training in the properties, hazards, handling requirements, and leak repair for chlorine and sulfur dioxide.\n\nFinally, the details of both facility and equipment design are key to the safe operations of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems.\n\ni.    Facility Design\n\nThe plant and support equipment of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide storage and control buildings meet and exceed design codes standards and good engineering practices. The buildings are equipped with ambient ventilation storage area and a fan ventilated control room.\n\nii.    Equipment Design\n\nThe low pressure chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems operate under a vacuum pressure of 13 inches of mercury. All the pipe, tubes, and equipment are chlorine- and sulfur dioxide-compatible nonmetallic piping. The system is designed with a safety factor covering the typical vacuum pressure in it. There are monitors that detect the presence of chlorine and/or sulfur dioxide in the storage building rooms. The audible alarms and lights in the plant alert employees of a potential leak, and are connected to the SCADA system to alert operator"

FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY \n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach Water Plant #1 had no accidental releases of chlorine or sulfur dioxide in the past five years per 40 CFR 67.42 (a).\n\n\n\n9.    EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \n\nEmergency response procedures are described in the City of Atlantic Beach Emergency Response Plan.  Emergency phone numbers are posted at each facility, indicating who to call first and what to do if that person is unreachable. The Jacksonville Fire Department (911) is the first call listed.  The Plant also has site specific emergency actions defined in the plant operating procedures. Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted annually by the operating department. Emergency operation and response procedures are reviewed and updated based on the results of the drill.\n\n\n\nThe emergency response program is reviewed by the Jacksonville Fire Department, which coordinates with local Duval County Emergency Response Planning Committee (LEPC) and Jacksonville Fire Department HazMat Team, all located in Duval County, Florida. Copies of the program are given to key local agencies including the fire, medical, rescue, management, and police departments in Atlantic Beach. Besides the specific emergency response program, key elements of the prevention programs are incorporated in the operating culture of the City of Atlantic Beach WTP # 1.\n\n\n\nThe Contingency Plan procedures detail the actions and responses to chlorine and sulfur dioxide spills (releases). The plan includes training of all chlorination and dechlorination-area operators. The primary response team is the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue, plus the HazMat Team, who respond to severe leak situations. A Chlorine \"B\" Leak Repair Kit is maintained on site to aid in stopping leaks. Public notification is facilitated through the Atlantic Beach Police Department, which has an automated emergency dialing message system for public notification.\n\n\n\n10.    PERSONNEL \n\nPersonne"
