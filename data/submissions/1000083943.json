This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility's processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\r\n\r\nThe Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex is located at 129010 Hatcherville Road, Baytown, Texas in Chambers County.\r\n\r\nThe Propane Dehydrogenation Unit receives liquid propane feed stock which is then vaporized and sent to the Catofin Reactors where it is partially converted to propylene and hydrogen along with additional by-products.  The mixed stream is then sent first through a deethanizer to recover the lighter products and then through a splitter to recover the propylene.  The propane is recycled into the feed stock and the by-products sent to the Mont Belvieu Main Complex for further processing.  Two refrigeration systems are used in the recovery process, one using propylene as a refrigerant and the other using ethylene.  Feed stock and products are transported to and from the facility via pipeline.  Ethylene refrigerant can be delivered via pipeline or truck.\r\n\r\nThe Isobutane Dehydrogenation Unit receives liquid isobutane feed stock which passes through Hot Combined Feed Exchanger (HCFE), three reactors in series, and a heater system composed of a charge heater and two inter-stage heaters. The resulting product is then passed through a cryogenic processing unit,"

These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures include applicable safety precautions that must be taken in the operation of the facility.  The procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nIn addition to training on operating procedures, the Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex has a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating the process.  New employees receive basic training in gas plant operations and safe work practices.  All operators receive refresher training on the operating procedures at least every three years to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  \r\n\r\n\r\nContractors\r\n\r\nThe Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the plant has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform plant personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.

The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the plant facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex is coordinated with the Chambers County (LEPC).  This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials and industry representatives.  The Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  \r\n  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nThe Mont Belvieu Hatcherville Road Complex resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.  Other recommendations for possible changes to improve safety come from periodic accident prevention program audits, incident investigations, or employee suggestions and recommendations."
