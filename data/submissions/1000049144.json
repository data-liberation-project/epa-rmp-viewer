(Rinchem) is totally committed to safety and the implementation of safe procedures.  Its commitment is exemplified by its overall safety policy which states:\n\n\n\n\"No job is more important than the health and safety of our employees, our communities and the environment.\" \n\n\n\nThis policy is supported by everyone at Rinchem, but first and foremost by senior management. \n\n\n\nB.    Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nRinchem's Flemington Chemical Warehouse at 55 River Road, Flemington, New Jersey, stores and distributes chemicals for the high tech, semiconductor, pharmaceutical and electronics industries. Hydrochloric acid (37%) and aqueous ammonia (29%) are stored above federal RMP thresholds and included in this report.  The facility also stores titanium tetrachloride in quantities above New Jersey's Toxic Catastrophe Prevention Act (TCPA) threshold, however does not exceed the federal threshold. The chemicals are not involved with any processes at this location other than handling and storage of closed totes, drums and bottles, and insertion of specially controlled dip tubes in certain drums. No transfer of material from one container to another occurs at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Rinchem's Flemington Chemical Warehouse is located in an industrial area with mixed agricultural and industrial areas. The facility was purchased by Rinchem and the inventory of materials stored on site was increased gradually from start of storage operations in 2008 until full storage operations were reached in 2009. After Rinchem purchased the property, Rinchem contracted to have the building modified as necessary to meet applicable fire codes, building codes and industry standards for warehouses that store hazardous materials. There are many features designed into the building that help to prevent a release to the environment of any of the stored substances, such as seconda"

The materials in the warehouse are segregated by hazard class according to the applicable federal and state regulations.\n\n\n\nC.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nThe three key elements of Rinchem's release prevention program are (1) compliance with federal and state regulations, (2) engineering controls, and (3) dedication to training and safety.\n\nThe areas of compliance include:\n\n\n\n-     having a Hazardous Materials Management Plan\n\n-     only accepting materials that are in Department of Transportation-approved containers\n\n-     segregating materials according to their hazard class\n\n-     limiting access to the facility\n\n-     performance of daily inspections of the material handling equipment used in the facility\n\n\n\nThe facility is inspected daily to ensure that all operations are running safely and smoothly and to determine if any of the containers in storage are leaking.  It is Rinchem's policy that any time a release is detected, the supervisor is notified and it is cleaned up immediately by properly trained technicians:  Rinchem personnel if the release is small or outside contractors for all other releases.  Training is an essential element of Rinchem's prevention program since an informed and trained workforce can prevent most accidents.  The training includes classroom and on-the-job training for all new employees, as well as annual reviews of the operating procedures with the employees and supervisors who perform the tasks at the facility.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Rinchem's Flemington Chemical Warehouse is updating and implementing a release prevention program in accordance with the New Jersey TCPA regulations for the storage of aqueous ammonia and hydrochloric acid.  The release prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n-    Process Safety Information\n\n-    Process Hazard Analysis with Risk Assessment\n\n-    Standard Operating Procedures\n\n-    EHS Operator Train"

Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nRinchem has a chemical exposure and spills procedure and a comprehensive business continuity plan.  The business continuity plan includes evacuation and notification procedures for the employees of Rinchem.  The facility is included in the written community emergency response plan.  Rinchem has made arrangements with an outside contractor for spill response.\n\n\n\nF.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nRinchem's procedures, safety policies, facility design and many other preventive measures keep its employees, the community and the environment safe.
