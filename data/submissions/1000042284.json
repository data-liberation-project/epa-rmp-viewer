      "SummaryText": "Executive Summary:\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Polices:\r\n\r\nThe Grifols Theraputics, Inc. facility, located in Clayton, NC, is a pharmaceutical plant which produces plasma therapies using a plasma refractionation process.  Many of the process steps occurring at the Grifols facility take place at temperature below 32 degrees F, and thus ammonia refrigeration systems are used to cool and or freeze materials at various steps throughout the process.  \r\n\r\nThe technologies used by Grifols require the use of chemicals which fall under the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Program (RMP) requirements.  As part of itA\u00bfs compliance program, the Grifols facility complies with the OSHA PSM standard for ammonia; the guidelines published by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR), for equipment specification and operating procedures; and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) for emergency response.  If an emergency were to occur, it is the facility policy to notify the Clayton, NC Fire Department and request that they respond.\r\n\r\nStationary Source of Regulated Substances:\r\n\r\nThe Grifols Theraputics, Inc. facility is located on approximately 182 acres roughly 2 A\u00be miles southeast of downtown Clayton, NC.  A CSX railroad line runs through the middle of the Clayton facility separating the main production facility, to the south of the railroad tracks, from the main ammonia refrigeration facility, the A\u00bfNorth PlantA\u00bf, located on the north side of the railroad line.\r\n\r\nFacility inventories indicate that the typical system charge is 30,000 pounds of ammonia.  The largest vessels in the system are two (2) high-pressure receivers which measure 11 feet long by 66 inches in diameter for a capacity of approximately 262 cubic feet or 10,451 pounds of ammonia.  These vessels are typically operated at 40 percent capacity, but could be filled to 88 percent capacity under NFPA code.  The 88 percent value of 9,20"

      "SummaryText": "0 pounds of ammonia is used in worst case release scenario calculations for this facility.  A failure in one of the receiver vessels would not cause a failure of the other vessel due to the spacing of the vessels and the presence of appropriately d pressure relief valves on each vessel.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario and The Alternative Release Scenario:\r\n\r\nUsing EPAA\u00bfs A\u00bfRisk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia RefrigerationA\u00bf the worst case release scenario was determined to be the failure of a high pressure receiver when filled to itsA\u00bf maximum operation capacity of 9,200 pounds (88%).  The high pressure receiver is contained within a building therefore the effects of passive mitigation were used in determining the maximum distance a toxic endpoint.  The distance to this endpoint is a circle centered on the A\u00bfNorth PlantA\u00bf with a 1.0 mile radius equivalent to the toxic endpoint concentration of 0.14 mg/l.\r\n\r\nThe worst case impact zone contains residential homes with a population of approximately 650 people.  Public receptors located within the worst case impact zone are a daycare center (0.7 miles) and the Powhatan Church (0.4 miles).  One environmental receptor, an unnamed tributary of the Neuse River (0.2 miles), is also located in the impact zone.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario chosen is the rupturing of a A\u00bd inch diameter pipe.  The machine room is equipped with an exhaust/water curtain system and an emergency dump system.  With this in mind passive and active mitigation systems were accounted for in estimating the distance to the toxic endpoint.  The alternative scenario produced a circle with a radius of 0.1 miles.  There are no public or environmental receptors within the impact zone.\r\n\r\nAccident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\r\n\r\nThe Grifols Clayton, NC facility complies with EPAA\u00bfs accident prevention rule and all applicable state and local codes and regulations.

Written procedures are in place to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Audits are conducted on a regularly scheduled basis to determine if all safety provisions are being properly implemented and to verify that suggested corrective actions are completed.  A preventative maintenance program is in place with scheduled maintenance procedures for compressors, pumps, evaporators, condensers, control valves, ammonia detectors, and emergency response equipment.  Any incident that results in or could have resulted in an injury or the release of ammonia is promptly investigated and reported upon.  Grifols employees are encouraged to voice their views on accident prevention issues and to recommend possible changes in order to make safety management and accident prevention a team effort with the ultimate goal of preventing a catastrophic release of ammonia.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History:\r\n\r\nThe Clayton, NC facility has not had an ammonia release of a reportable nature (greater than 100 pounds) in the last five years.  \r\n\r\nNo accidents involving the ammonia refrigeration system have occurred at the Grifols, Clayton, NC facility in the last 5 years.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program:\r\n\r\nGrifols has a written emergency response plan which is on file with the Johnston County Local Emergency Planning Commission (LEPC).
