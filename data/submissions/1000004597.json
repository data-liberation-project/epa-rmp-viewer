This Plan was designed to meet the following objectives:\n\n1.) To save lives.\n2.) To minimize and avoid injuries.\n3.) To protect the environment.\n4.) To minimize property damage.\n\nVons maintains an emergency response committee whose members are the designated emergency coordinators for the facility.  The Plan provides the response organization and notification procedures, evacuation routes, ammonia health hazards, and mitigation procedures which will be implemented to respond effectively to emergency situations that may arise at the facility.  This Plan is reviewed and updated at least once per year.  This Plan was reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with the PSM and RMP regulations, as well as to incorporate any facility changes. \n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\n\nThe Vons Meat Service Center facility uses ammonia to provide refrigeration for several refrigerated warehouses. There are two ammonia systems that operate independently and are located in separate buildings on the property: Meat Services Process (MS) and Deli Kitchen (DK). Each area has several evaporators used to keep various rooms cold.  Liquid ammonia is transferred from a high pressure receiver to a low pressure accumulator where the pressures (temperature) of the ammonia is reduced. (Low pressure is achieved in the accumulators by allowing the high pressure liquid from the reciever to expand through an expansion valve.)  The resulting low pessure liquid is pumped to several evaporating units, to privide cooling capabilities for the refrigerated warehouses. The liquid/vapor return from the evaporators is recycled back to the low pressure accumulator. Compressors remove the refrigerant vapor from the accumulator and compress it to high pressure vapor. Compressed vapor from the compressors is transf"

      "SummaryText": "The total is then posted at the time clock for removal by a supervisor at the time of a drill or an emergency evacuation.  Supervisors will track employees who leave the facility.\n\nIf an ammonia release occurs, the employees will immediately notify their supervisor.  The supervisor will use the intercom system and/or telephone to inform the other employees and the Incident Commander.  With all of the information provided by the employees and supervisors the Incident Commander will decide which employees need to be evacuated and which employees should stay sheltered within their building.  Also, the Incident Commander will decide which of the designated assembly areas will be the safest to use for the evacuation.  If employee evacuation is necessary in certain locations, the supervisors will be told the designated assembly area over their portable radios or over the intercom system.  An evacuation will require the use of the intercom in that location along with assistance from all nearby supervisors.  The supervisors and intercom will inform the employees of the assembly location chosen.  To insure all employees are familiar with evacuation procedures, evacuation drills are performed once a year at Vons. \n\nIf there is a fire at the Vons facility, a procedure similar to an ammonia release will be followed.  The employees will inform their supervisor of the emergency and the supervisor will use the intercom system and/or telephone to inform other employees and the Incident Commander.  The meteorological conditions and wind direction are not as vital as they are for an ammonia release, but it is necessary to know what equipment is in the fire location which could rupture or break, causing more danger to employees.  With this information the IC will make the evacuation decisions.  The designated assembly areas are the same for all emergencies at Vons. \n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe Von's facility has conducted a PSM/RMP Compliance Audit and a revalidated the P"

In 1999, the PSM plan was updated to comply with the requirements of RMP 40 CFR 68. Because Von's Meat Service Center is in the State of California, the RMP plan was recently amended to comply with the requirements of the California Accidental Release Plan (CalARP) regulations.\n\nFIVE YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nBetween June 2004 and June 2009, there have been no releases of ammonia that exceeded the Federal Reportable Quantity of 100 pounds. In addition, there have been no injuries resulting from an ammonia release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nRace Engineering Refrigeration Co. has an Emergency Response Team which works in conjunction with the Emergency Response Team at Vons. \n\nThe Vons facility has several locations which are occupied by personnel during operational hours.  If an ammonia release occurred, some or all of these employees may need to be evacuated.  Additional evacuation instructions  are posted inside each building for employee viewing which show locations of all emergency exits and also indicate where to assemble outside each facility for a roll call.\n\nOne roll call method employed by Vons is to print out the number of personnel in the warehouse from the time-in attendance system, and post the count by the time clock.  The number of non-hourly individuals and the person counting heads are also added to the total number."
