The OSHA standard  is referenced in this RMP Registration Form, see section 8.3 (b).\n\n     5.     Five-Year Accident History.\n          There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have\n     caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge,\n     has there been any accidental releases resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property\n     damage, or environmental damage.\n\n     6.     Emergency Action Plan.\n          This facility has:\n               a.     A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n               b.

Facility Policy.\n          The owners, management and employees of  MO. Valley Agri-Service of Atchison County, Inc. are committed to the prevention  of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, Holt County LEPC, and/or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.\n\n\n     2.     Facility Information.\n          The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to area farmers. Anhydrous\n     ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production.\n     The maximum quantity stored would be 130,000 pounds in a storage tank and nurse tanks.\n\n     \n     3.     Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n          a.     The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank\n     released as gas over a period of 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 78,000\n     pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85% capacity as limited by\n     design standards and administrative controls.  The distance to the end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million or ppm) is 3.3 miles.\n\n          b.     The alternate release scenario, a 1-inch transfer hose is used as an alternate release\n     scenario followed by release of ammonia for 2 minutes before an automatic excess flow\n     shut-down valve/valves intervenes or remote manual shut-off is closed and stops the flow of\n     ammonia. The maximum quantity released would be 2,900 pounds. The distance to the end point\n     (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.3 miles.\n\n     4.     Accidental R"
