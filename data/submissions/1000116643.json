The TTSI terminal provides transloading services of bulk products between rail and truck transportation modes.  The Charlotte General Products TRANSFLO terminal has been in operation since 1980.  The terminal is located at 601 North Hoskins road, Charlotte, NC 28213\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\n\nTRANSFLO is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, contract operators, the surrounding community and the environment; therefore it is TRANSFLO policy to maintain compliance with 40 CFR 68.\n\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\n\nTRANSFLO will handle vinyl acetate monomer at this terminal, transloading product from railroad tank cars into highway cargo trailers in quantities in excess of 8,000 gallons.\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, TRANSFLO has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for vinyl acetate monomer using the parameters specified by the EPA. Using the EPA's RMP*Comp software program, it was determined that the distance to the toxic endpoint in this scenario has the potential to result in a release with offsite consequences.  The worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is considered to have an extremely low probability of occurrence.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario\n\nTRANSFLO has decided to include one alternative release scenario into the RMP document.  The alternative release scenario identified by TRANSFLO is the failure of a product transfer hose.  Using the EPA RMP*Comp software program and EPA's RMP offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance Document, the distance to the flamma"

These processes include preventative maintenance of the transfer unit to maintain on-board safety and control systems.\n\nThe transfer unit has been designed and constructed to meet or exceed the requirements outlined in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code (2008 ed.).  \n\nTRANSFLO has conducted training and familiarization sessions with the Charlotte Fire Department as part of the terminals emergency action plan (EAP).   In addition, the following agencies inspect the TRANSFLO terminal on a regular basis:\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation- Federal Railroad Administration- Hazardous Materials Inspectors.  \n\nCharlotte Fire Department\n\nMecklenburg County Department of Environmental Protection\n\n\nFive- Year Accident History\n\nSince inception there has been one release incident involving this product.  On 7/24/14 a release of approximately 330 gallons occurred.  There were no off site impacts or injuries associated with this incident.  \n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nTRANSFLO and the contract operator have documented emergency response plans and pr"

Included in the emergency response plan are measures to be taken internally by TRANSFLO contract operators to control the release, if possible, and to make initial notification to local responders and to TRANSFLO headquarters.\n\nTo assure that the local municipal response agencies are familiar with TRANSFLO emergency response procedures and copies of the Emergency Action plan (EAP) have been shared with and reviewed by local responders.  In the event of a significant release of vinyl acetate monomer that involve off site populations, these populations will be notified through the LEPC.\n\nPlanned Changes To Improve Safety\n\nTRANSFLO and its contract operators have implemented a continuous training program for employees and preventative maintenance procedures for the transfer unit to ensure a high level of safety performance and regulatory compliance.  Since the initial RMP submittal in 2002 TRANSFLO has added passive mitigation in the form of berms in the transfer area to limit the worst case scenario pool size and thus reduce the impact radius and potential impacted population. \n\n\n\n\nChange Record- 20140620 Updated for 5 year resubmittal. \nEdited Executive Summary and Entered Incident as per Mecklenburg Co.  guidance.
