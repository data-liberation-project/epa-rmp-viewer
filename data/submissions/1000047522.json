Should an accidental release occur, this facility has worked with the local fire department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) so they can plan for response to a release and minimize the impact of the releases to people and the environment.\n\n\n\nThe Northern Star Co is a potato processing facility with approximately 300 employees.  \n\n\n\nThe regulated substance used at his facility that meets threshold quantities is anhydrous ammonia.  Ammonia is used as a manufacturing aid in the refrigeration process.  Refrigeration is used in processing and storing of potato products.\n\nAll refrigeration maintenance personnel go through training on all the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) from the OSHA 1910.119 Process Safety Management Program. \n\n \n\nThe facility has developed a Worst Case and Alternative Case Scenario for the Risk Management Plan.  The information pertaining to the WCS and ACS can be viewed in the RMP Binder located at the facilities PSM Library.\n\nThe facility has a written Emergency Action Plan in accordance with OSHA 1910.119\n\nEmergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know (EPCRA) information is provided to the state emergency response commission, local emergency planning committee and local fire department as required by the Superfund Amendment Reauthorization Act (SARA)Title  III of the EPCRA.\n\n\n\nThe facility Safety Team conducts regular drills and training of specialized personnel.  The policies for reporting spills and releases is documented in the Policies and Procedures manual updated by the Corporate Environmental Operations office."
