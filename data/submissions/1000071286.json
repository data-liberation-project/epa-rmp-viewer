The elements of the plan are intended to prevent and minimize the accidental releases of extremely hazardous substances used on site. The AUC facility emergency response program involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to the facility and the emergency response services available in the community. AUC's emergency response program has incorporated EPA and OSHA Emergency Response Program requirements and is modeled after the \"One Plan\".\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FACILITY AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\n\nAllied Universal Corporation repackages chlorine and sulfur dioxide into U.S. DOT specification cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks (commonly known as ton containers).  In addition, Allied manufactures sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite.  The facility includes a private sidetrack for unloading railcars. A production building, with an emergency scrubber, is used for packaging the cylinders and multi-unit tank car tanks. A room outside of the production building is used for sodium hypochlorite production and quality control testing.  Sodium bisulfite production operations are immediately adjacent to the aboveground storage tank farm, with a scrubber for the manufacturing process.  The chlorine and sulfur dioxide gas detection system as well as CCTV camera system continuously monitors all production and storage locations.  Based upon the program criteria as set forth in the Risk Management Rule, including EPA's definition of a \"covered process\", the chlorine and sulfur dioxide processes at this facility are subject to Program 3 planning.\n\n\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nTh"
