Storing a large quantity of chlorine and ammonia can be a hazard if it is not handled properly.  The Yuma Desalting Plant is owned and operated by the Bureau of Reclamation.  As such, it takes its safety obligations in storing and using chlorine and ammonia seriously.  The following document describes what could happen if there were to be an accident, the steps the Bureau of Reclamation takes every day to ensure a safely operating plant, and what to do in the event of an emergency.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe Yuma Desalting Plant accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates proven technology, staff training on operation and maintenance practices, and tested management system practices.  All applicable procedures of the State of Arizona and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Prevention Program are adhered to, including key elements such as training, systems management, and emergency response procedures.  \n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation recognizes the responsibility to make its environment, community and employee safety a primary part of our daily concerns.  The Bureau of Reclamation is committed to being a responsible member of any community in which it has operations by giving top priority to operating in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  The Bureau of Reclamation is dedicated to developing an environmentally responsible energy resource compatible with community needs.   The prevention of accidents and protection of its employees, property and the general public are essential to the efficient and successful completion of every project undertaken by the Bureau of Reclamation. The Bureau of Reclamation requires active injury and illness prevention as an important element of production on a daily basis.\n\nThis document complies with the EPA Risk Management Program u"

This document summarizes the Bureau of ReclamationA?s existing health and safety programs, its internal management response procedures, and ongoing actions that are designed to prevent or minimize impacts of accidental releases of chlorine and ammonia to the environment. The Yuma Desalting Plant Authority has prepared an emergency action plan to handle any potential accidental releases.\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances Information\n\nThe Yuma Desalting Plant is located at 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona in the southwest corner of Arizona near the California and Mexico borders.  The YDP is located in the northwest quarter of Yuma, immediately south of Cocopah R.V. and Golf Resort and adjacent to the Arizona Public Service Yucca Power Plant.\n\nYDP use the chlorine to provide a chlorine solution as a disinfecting agent.  This disinfecting step is necessary to promote the destruction of algae, bacteria, micro-organisms. YDP uses the anhydrous ammonia system to convert hypochlorous acid into chloramine solution for use as a disinfecting agent.  The maximum quantity of chlorine and ammonia stored at Yuma Desalting Plant exceeds the federal RMP specified threshold quantities of 2,500 pounds and 10,000 pounds, respectively ; thus, the facility is subject to federal RMP regulations.  The anhydrous chlorine and ammonia processes are Program 3 processes.  \n\nSummary of the Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps \n\nYuma Desalting Plant is in compliance with federal Process Safety Management requirements. Yuma Desalting PlantA?s accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\nDetailed management system and clear levels of responsibilities and team member roles.\nComprehensive process safety information that is readily available to staff, emergency responders, and contractors.\nComprehen"

The operating procedures include start-up, normal operation, and shutdown procedures.  Operating procedures will be developed and put in place prior to any new process equipment coming on line or changes made in the handling of chlorine and ammonia equipment, and reconfiguration of the facilities.\n\nTraining \n\nYuma Desalting Plant employees presently involved in operating or maintaining the chlorine and ammonia processes are trained in an overview of the processes and detailed applicable operating and maintenance procedures. The Bureau of Reclamation ensures that each employee newly assigned to the processes, is trained and tested to be competent in the operating procedures listed pertaining to their duties.

The Bureau of Reclamation assembles an audit team that will include personnel knowledgeable in the Risk Management Program rule and in the processes.  This team will evaluate whether the prevention program satisfies the requirements of the Risk Management Program rule and whether the prevention program is sufficient to help ensure safe operation of the processes.  The results of the audit will be documented, recommendations resolved, and appropriate enhancements to the prevention program will be implemented.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Bureau of Reclamation investigates all incidents that could reasonably have resulted in a catastrophic release (serious injury to personnel, the public, or the environment) so that similar accidents can be prevented.  An investigation team is assembled and the investigation is initiated within 48 hours of the incident.  The results of the investigation are documented, recommendations are resolved, and appropriate process enhancements are implemented.
