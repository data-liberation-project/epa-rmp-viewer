If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to immediately vacate the premises, move to a safe location, and notify the Local Volunteer Fire Department (via a 911 call) and request that it respond to the emergency. Incidental to the notification to the fire department, a call to the Franklin Co. Emergency Management will be made. While we have planned for an emergency, it is acknowledged that a real emergency will be unexpected and may very well be different and cannot be ensured to duplicate what may have been planned. In reality, the situation that develops may not happen in a manner in which it has been planned. In that event, what we may have planned will serve only as a guideline to follow. The Emergency Action Plan for this facility describes certain procedures that are intended to minimize the hazards associated with human health and the environment from fires, explosions, the sudden and unexpected release of chemicals, tornadoes, bomb threats, vandalism, or other accidents or acts of God which might occur on our premises. The primary emergency response coordinator for the Rowan, IA location is Dan Schmauss, Location Manager. His work and 24-Hour emergency response telephone numbers are provided in the Registration Section of this document. The 24-Hour emergency response number provided in that section also provides a telephone tree for additional individuals who are available and can respond to an emergency at that location.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA STORAGE/DISTRIBUTION PLANT AND THE REGULATED SUBSTANCE HANDLED AT NEW COOPERATIVE, INC., ROWAN, IA.\n\nThis facility is a bulk anhydrous ammonia storage and distribution plant.
