      "SummaryText": "This facility is a wastewater treatment plant, which is owned and operated by the City of Milledgeville.  We are located in the SE section of Baldwin County in a urban area.  We use chlorination for the disinfection of water.  The chlorine is stored in 2000 lb. cylinders, with a maximum of 3 cylinders on hand at all times.  After disinfection, the chlorine is neutralized with sulfur dioxide.  The sulfur dioxide is stored in 2000 lb. cylinders, with a maximum of 2 cylinders on hand at all times.  Our maximum inventory for sulfur dioxide is not above the threshold; therefore, it will be handled under the general duty clause.  We have not had any accidents with chlorine in the past five years that caused impacts onsite or offsite.  Our facility complies with the recommended safety procedures and standards for chlorine handling and use and all applicable state and federal laws.  We use passive mitigation systems and have an automatic chlorine switch over and a chlorine detecting alarm system as a proactive to prevent any accidental releases.  Our employees will respond to minor releases that can be handled as standard operating procedures, and they have been trained on how to safely do so.  Our employees will not respond to major releases.  We have a written policy (with training) to inform the City of Milledgeville and/or the Baldwin County Fire Department through the use of 911.  Both Fire Departments are equipped to handle a release to the magnitude in which the chlorine is stored."
