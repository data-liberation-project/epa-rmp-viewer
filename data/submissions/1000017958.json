      "SummaryText": "HARCROS CHEMICALS INC. - WEST POINT: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n1. Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies\n\nThis distribution facility stores chlorine cylinders which are considered hazardous.  The same properties that make chlorine a valuable commodity chemical also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as that of our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle chlorine cylinders, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.  Note: this facility may also occasionally store a limited number of sulfur dioxide cylinders.  We will take the necessary precautions with this hazardous material but the amount stored will be below the threshold amount.  Therefore, only chlorine is registered.\n\n\n2. The stationary source and regulated substances handled\n\nOne of the purposes of this facility is to store chlorine for distribution to our customers which include water treatment facilities and general industry.  Chlorine is received in Department of Transportation (DOT) approved 150 pound cylinders and are shipped in the same packages.  Chlorine is not used, manufactured, or repackaged at this facility.  Access to the site is restricted to Harcros employees, and authorized contractors and visitors.  The storage of chlorine at this site is subject to RMP Program Level 2.  \n\n\n3. The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nThis distribution facility complies with EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  This facility is operated in accordance with recommendations from The Chlorine Institute and with the Responsible Distribution guidelines of the National Association of C"

      "SummaryText": "hemical Distributors.\n\nA summary of our Prevention Program\n\nSAFETY INFORMATION - Our facilities maintain current copies of Material Safety Data Sheets for all hazardous chemicals stored including Chlorine.  In addition, this facility has current copies of all relevant Chlorine Institute pamphlets.\n\nHAZARD REVIEW - A hazard review is conducted for the chlorine container storage process at least every 5 years.  We primarily use a checklist prepared by the Chlorine Institute which is relevant to our operations.  At least one hourly employee (warehouse personnel or driver) takes part in this review.  Corrective or preventative actions discovered during these reviews are documented and addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOPERATING PROCEDURES - We have Standard Operating Procedures covering all aspects of storage and movement of containers.\n\nTRAINING - All new drivers and warehouse personnel attend a 5 or 3 day training workshop covering a variety of safety, environmental, and regulatory topics.  Workers at facilities that store chlorine receive additional training on the hazards, health effects, and operating procedures specific to that chemical.  Refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years.\n\nMAINTENANCE - Container storage is the only process for RMP chemicals at this facility.  We perform a visual inspection of containers when received and before loading for delivery to customers.  In addition, we perform daily inspections and routine maintenance on the forklift trucks used to move containers.\n\nINCIDENT INVESTIGATION - We have an Incident Investigation SOP which requires operation managers to document and investigate incidents involving injuries and environmental releases, as well as \"near-misses\" that could have lead to injuries and releases.  These reports are reviewed by Corporate safety personnel and are shared with all facilities within the company.  Corrective actions proposed as a result of these investigations are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nCOMPLIANCE"

      "SummaryText": " AUDIT - A compliance audit is conducted at least every 3 years to assure the documentation and procedures fully comply with the RMP regulations.  Deficiencies discovered during audits are corrected in a timely manner.\n\n\n4. Five year accident history\n\nWithin the past 5 years, this facility has had no accidental releases that have resulted in deaths, injuries or significant property damage on-site, or known off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage.\n\n\n5. The emergency response program\n\nThis facility does not have its own emergency response team.  There are too few employees to properly staff a response team.  Emergency response will be by public responders, by trained response teams from other, nearby Harcros Chemical facilities, and by other responders trained according to the Chlorine Institute's Pamphlet 64 (Emergency Response Plans for Chlorine Facilities).  We have discussed our Risk Management Program with the West Point Fire Department and have coordinated emergency response with them.  Harcros employees will be available to assist trained responders.\n\n\n6. Planned changes to improve safety\n\nHarcros has operated this distribution facility since 2002 and started storing chlorine at this site in 2007.  We continue to participate in The Chlorine Institute and the National Association of Chemical Distributor programs, and to continue to improve our operations in accordance with Responsible Distribution Guidelines.  \n\nThere are no specific safety improvements planned at this time but we anticipate making additional security improvements as we develop our Security Plan in accordance with Department of Homeland Security requirements.  \n"
