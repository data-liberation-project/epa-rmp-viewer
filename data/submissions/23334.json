The Facility Policy\n\n    MFA Incorporated, and the employees of the MFA Agri Service in Grant City are\ncommitted to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an\naccidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Grant City Fire\nDepartment, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the\nrelease to people and the environment.\n\n2. Facility Information\n\n    The primary activity at the facility is the receiving and storage of grain and\nlivestock feed.  This facility distributes anhydrous ammonia and dry fertilizer for direct\napplication as a crop nutrient. This facility also handles farm supplies and pesticides.\n\n    The maximum quantity stored would be 4,400 pounds in each 1,000 gallon nurse\ntank.  There could be as many as 10 nurse tanks parked at the facility at any one time. \nThis facility does not transfer anhydrous ammonia.\n\n3. The worst-case and alternative release scenario.\n\n    a. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of\nthree nurse tanks released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released\nwould be 13,500 pounds, which represents the volume of the three tanks at 85 percent\ncapacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 0.82 miles.\n\n    b. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a\nrelease from a break in a 1? valve. This release is assumed to last approximately 2\nminutes before the excess flow or manual shut-off valves stop the flow. The maximum\nquantity release would be 2,700 pounds. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion\nto 200 ppm) is 0.47 miles.\n\n4. The Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the\nStora"

The Five-year Accident History\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five\nyears that: have caused any deaths, injuries, or significant property damage at the facility;\nnor to our knowledge, have resulted in offsite deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in\nplace, property damage, or environmental damage.\n\n6. The Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has;\n\n    a. a written emergency action plan, in accordance with OSHA\n       Standard, 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\n    b. provided State and Local authorities with the emergency\n       planning and community right-to-know information as\n       required under SARA Title III (EPCRA);\n\n    c. a written emergency response program, in accordance with\n       OSHA Standard, 29 CFR 1910.120, including pre-emergency\n       planning and employee training.\n\n7. Planned changes to improve safety.\n\n    Safety improvement is an on-going process at the facility. Periodic evaluations are\nperformed to assess the maintenance of safe conditions. There are no additional specific\nanhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
