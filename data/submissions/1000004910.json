This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training; consideration to safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Chlorination System; an aggressive preventive maintenance program; and comprehensive operating procedures.  Helix Water District\u00c2\u00bfs policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of all chemicals including regulated substances.\n \nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCE\nChlorine is injected into the water in order to disinfect it and to prevent bacterial growth while the water travels through pipelines. The maximum intended inventory for this facility is approximately 48,000 pounds of chlorine kept in 24 one-ton containers.  \n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENT SUMMARY/OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary:\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one worst-case release scenario has been defined for the Chlorination System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary:\nScenario Description: Per the EPA Regulations, one alternative-case release scenario has been defined for the Chlorination System.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation.  \n\nRisk Considerations:\nAlthough the storage and use of chlorine has inherent potential risks and the release scenarios can potentially reach sensitive populations within the community, the Helix Water District has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the facility and plant personnel to make the worst-case event non-credible, it should also be recognized that there are inherent analysis assumptions that make the results of the atmospheric dispersion an"

The facility has a scrubber, rupture discs, and chlorine gas detection.  For protection of employees and responders, safety showers and respiratory equipment are available on site.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM\nAs part of the implementation of the RMP Program 3, key Prevention Program elements were documented and implemented by Helix Water District to manage process safety issues associated with the use of chlorine. Prevention Program 3 elements include:\n\n\u00c2\u00a768.65\tProcess Safety Information (PSI) \n\u00c2\u00a768.67\tProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\u00c2\u00a768.69 \tOperating Procedures (OP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.71\tTraining (TRN)\n\u00c2\u00a768.73\tMechanical Integrity (MI)\n\u00c2\u00a768.75\tManagement of Change (MOC)\n\u00c2\u00a768.77\tPre-Startup Review (PSSR)\n\u00c2\u00a768.79\tCompliance Audits (CA)\n\u00c2\u00a768.81\tIncident Investigation (II)\n\u00c2\u00a768.83\tEmployee Participation (EP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.85\tHot Work Permit (HWP)\n\u00c2\u00a768.87\tContractors (CO)\n\u00c2\u00a768.90\tEmergency Planning & Response (EP&R)\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThere have been no RMP-applicable releases of chlorine at the facility in at least the past five (5) years.  \n\nFLAMMABLES: WORST CASE\nThe use of flammable materials at the Helix Water District facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable. \n\nFLAMMABLES: ALTERNATIVE RELEASE\nThe use of flammable materials at the Helix Water District facility is not encompassed by either the federal or state RMP requirements.  Therefore, this section is not applicable.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM \nHelix Water District has implemented an Emergency Response Program (ERP) to prepare for potential incidents, respond to them effectively, and recover from their impacts.  The ERP has includ"

The facility has HAZWOPER trained responders who are able to react to emergency situations.  Emergency training is provided annually to the emergency response team. The ERP meets Cal/OSHA 8 CCR 5192 and Cal/OSHA 8 CCR 3220.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nHelix Water District is extremely diligent in the handling of chlorine.  Planned changes to improve safety are listed as recommendations in the PHA Report.  The recommendations listed in the report have been closed.  Recommendations generated in the 2007 PHA Revalidation have also been completed."
