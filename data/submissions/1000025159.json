North Street\n\nSpencerville, OH  45887\n\n\n\n\n\nFXI, Inc. owns and operates a polyurethane foam manufacturing facility in Spencerville, OH.  The operations at the facility have not changed and the TDI processes, and procedures have not changed since the last RMP submission.  Company changed its name to FXI, Inc in 2021.  FXI, Inc.  receives raw materials at its facility, mixes the materials to produce a polyurethane foam bun on a foam production line.  The foam is then cured and stored on site prior to shipping to customers.  Some limited fabrication takes place at the facility.  The polyurethane foam produced by FXI, Inc. is used in many common household products, including seat cushions, bedding and pillows, and many automotive products where soft foam cushions are required.\n\n\n\nOne of the components used in the production of polyurethane foam is toluene diisocyanate (TDI).  This compound is subject to EPA's Risk Management Rule.\n\n\n\nToluene diisocyanate is delivered to the North Street facility in tank trucks.  The trucks are off-loaded to a storage tank located inside the building.  Because the storage of TDI takes place inside the building, the probability of release of toluene diisocyanate vapors into the atmosphere is reduced.  As a result, the impact of such a release on the surrounding community is minimized.  There are no receptors (buildings and people other than the FFP facility) that would be impacted by the release of stored TDI.\n\n\n\nBecause there are no public receptors and there have been no significant accidents or reportable  release of TDI in the last five years, FXI, Inc.'s North Street facility is classified as a \"Program 1\" facility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWORST-CASE SCENARIO\n\n\n\nDELETED in accordance with April 19 2004 Ruling.\n\n\n\nSECTION 2.  TOXICS:  WORST CASE  EXPLANATION\n\n\n\nDELETED in accordance with April 19 2004 Ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\nACCIDENT PREVENTION\n\n\n\nFXI, Inc. takes safety very seriously.  We use safety equipment and strict proce"
