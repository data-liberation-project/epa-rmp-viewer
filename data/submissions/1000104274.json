On 12/19/2022, Bassett Mechanical evacuated all ammonia from the system and charged it with Nitrogen to remain in an idle state and will remain idle for the foreseeable future. \n\nWhen the system was operational, Foremost Farms USA (Foremost Farms) stores up to 10,770 pounds of anhydrous ammonia at the dairy plant located at 2294 Randall Road, Athens, Wisconsin (the Property).  Ammonia is used as a refrigerant at the dairy facility.  The quantity stored exceeds the 10,000 pound TQ for ammonia, and is therefore regulated under 40 CFR Part 68.  Foremost Farms contracted Northern Environmental to prepare a Risk Management Program for ammonia at the Milan facility.  The Risk Management Program consists of five elements:  the management system, hazard assessment, prevention program, emergency response, and the risk management plan (RMP) submittal.\n\nThe Foremost Farms-Milan management system lists Mr. Derek Humphries, Director of EHS, as having overall responsibility for implementation of the risk management program.  Facility managers and supervisors assist the plant manager as delegated.\n\nThe hazard assessment included an off-site consequence analysis (OCA) and a summary of the 5-year accident history.  The OCA worst-case release scenario was the loss of 3,134 pounds of ammonia from the refrigeration system.  The OCA selected alternative release scenario was a release of 2,060 pounds of ammonia in ten minutes.  There have not been any accidents within the last five years (from submittal date) that resulted in deaths, injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. \n\nBecause ammonia is also regulated under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) Standard (29 CFR 1910.119), the prevention program elements under Program 3 of 40 CFR Part 68 apply.  These elements are safety information, process haz"

Based upon a review of the existing PSM and ERP, and discussion with facility management, the programs meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 68."
