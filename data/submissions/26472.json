Portable nurse tank over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 437.75 pounds, which represents the volume of the portable nurse tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.\n     B.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to toxic endpoint is .4 mile.\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  \n     Our facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K61.1\" published by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) and the Standards of the Occupaional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 \"Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia\" as well as all applicable regulations under the Iowa Fertilizer Law.\n5.
