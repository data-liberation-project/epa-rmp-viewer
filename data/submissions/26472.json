If an acidental release should occur,  our facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n2.  FACILITY INFORMATION.\n     The primary activity of our facility is the storage of anhydrous ammonia for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  The maximum quantity stored would be 210,120 pounds in 48 portable nurse tanks.\n3.  WORST-CASE RELEASE SCENARIO AND THE ALTERNATIVE RELEASE SCENARIO.\n     A.  The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the entire contents of a 1,000 gal. Portable nurse tank over 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 437.75 pounds, which represents the volume of the portable nurse tank at 85% capacity as limited by design standards.\n     B.  The alternative release scenario is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to toxic endpoint is .4 mile.\n4.  ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM.  \n     Our facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia,K61.1 published by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) and the Standards of the Occupaional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.111 Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia as well as all applicable regulations under the Iowa Fertilizer Law.\n5.  FIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY.\n     There has been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that; have caused any deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property or environmental damage.\n6.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM.\n     A.  The facility has a written action plan, in accordance with OSHA Standard CFR 1910.38 wh"
