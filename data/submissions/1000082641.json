(Home Market Foods) facility, located at 140 Morgan Drive, Norwood, Massachusetts (the Property), produces and distributes quality meat products.  The facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature in support of production needs and for storing the product until distribution.  Anhydrous ammonia is an effective refrigerant that has been used for many years by most food processing facilities.  Ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperatures but is handled as a gas that is liquefied under pressure.  The refrigeration system consists of pressure vessels, evaporators, compressors, piping and other refrigeration equipment.  The same properties that make ammonia a valuable refrigerant also make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions during its use to prevent exposure to workers, the surrounding community, and the environment.  Please refer to Figure 1 for the location of Property.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies:  \n\n\n\nHome Market Foods is committed to promoting safety for the facility, its employees and the area surrounding its facility. Home Market Foods complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management Standard, Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1910.110 and United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Risk Management Program (RM Program) Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The purpose of these programs is to ensure that the refrigeration system is operated safely to prevent releases of ammonia from the system  In addition, the Home Market Foods operational procedures are established within formulated regulatory guidelines, outlining appropriate emergency action steps to take in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nFive Year Update:\n\n\n\nThis Risk Management Plan (RMP) was originally developed in September 2"

      "SummaryText": "004 by American Refrigeration, Inc. for Home Market Foods.  GeoInsight, Inc. performed the requisite regulatory update necessary for covered facilities on their initial five year RMP submission anniversary date of September 24, 2009, and conducted the same task in the succeeding five year update(s) on September 24, 2014, and September 24, 2019.  The 2019 update included performance of an off-site consequence analysis (OCA), considering data revised from the 2010 census.  2010 Census data was not available at the time the 2014 plan was prepared.  \n\n\n\nRegulated Substance:\n\n\n\nHome Market Foods operates a refrigeration system utilizing anhydrous ammonia as the primary refrigerant.  Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process where the refrigerant, ammonia, is used as a heat exchanging fluid to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment.  The refrigeration cycle consists of evaporation, compression, condensation and expansion.  Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.  Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy.  The refrigeration cycle is a closed-loop process.  The ammonia cycle utilizes fluid temperature, pressure and latent heat of vaporization for cooling.  The refrigeration system uses this phenomenon to remove heat from a desired space, and then to discard that heat through condensation.\n\n\n\nHome Market Foods operates its main machine room (having compressors, condenser, receivers), as well as the low pressure side of the system \n\n(pump receivers, coil evaporators, water chillers and coolers) to maintain processing, freezer and holding room temperatures required for manufacturing of and storage of their product.  There are approximately 425 employees at the Home Market Foods facility, including hourly and salary personnel that support manufacturing and logistics relating to product preparation and product shipment.

      "SummaryText": "ods operates approximately 24 hours a day, five days a week.\n\n\n\nAggregate ammonia storage is 25,592 pounds (lbs).  The potential hazards that could lead to an accidental release of the ammonia include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, damage to piping, damage to equipment, human error, etc.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program:  \n\n\n\nAs a part of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) program, Home Market Foods has established numerous programs that serve to prevent accidental releases of ammonia.  The programs include:\n\n\n\n?    Process Safety Information;\n\n?    Process Hazard Analysis;\n\n?    Operating Procedures;\n\n?    Training;\n\n?    Mechanical Integrity;\n\n?

Contractor Safety.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Information:  \n\n\n\nAs a part of the PSM Program, Home Market Foods maintains an Emergency Action Plan that was prepared to improve responsiveness to an emergency incident, and to increase the reliability of actions taken during an incident.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, notification of local emergency response agencies as well as the public.  In the event of an emergency involving the ammonia system, it is the policy of the facility to request assistance as necessary by calling 911.\n\n\n\nFive-Year Accident History:  \n\n\n\nHome Market Foods has not had any ammonia system accidents over the last five years that have resulted in on-site deaths, injuries, or significant property damage.\n\n\n\nSteps to Improve Safety:  \n\n\n\nHome Market Foods takes a hands-on approach to enduring the safety of their employees and community.  Home Market Foods will operate and maintain the system in accordance with IIAR Guidance and will continue to implement its OSHA PSM Program in conjunction with the RM Program.\n\n"
