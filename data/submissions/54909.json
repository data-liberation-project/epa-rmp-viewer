Resources used in the process was International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration Guidelines, RMP Comp, Landview 6 and Cold Storage Technologies. \n\nThis report and Risk Management Plan re-submission was prepared in compliance with the\n5-year update requirement of 40 CFR Part 68. Activities conducted in the preparation of\nthis report included, but were not limited to, review of original registration information,\nverification of longitude and latitude using U. S. Geological Survery information, Worst\nCase & Alternative Case release scenarios using EPA RMPComp software, population\nestimation using Landview data, review of the most recent 5-year accident history records,\nand complete review of all original RMP/PHA documentation from June 1999. A modified\nversion of the procedures used to develop the original RMP were followed to prepare this\nupdate.\n\nAll procedures, plans, and recommendations from the original 1999 RMP and 2004 Update  were reviewed and verified. With minor updates, it was determined that the Fowler Packing operating procedures, accident prevention plan, and emergency response plan are current, still effective, and complete. Where necessary the original RMP information has been corrected\nor appended to update the risk management program with changes to information, lists, and contacts during the subsequent period since initial implementation.\n\nThere have been no reportable accidental releases from this facility during the past 5-year period covered by the current RMP.\n\nProcess Information\nThe site is located 8 miles South of Fresno, California between Hwy 41 and Hwy 99. The\ntopography is generally flat and is rural, dedicated to farming with orchards and vineyards\nsurrounding the facility for several miles in most directions. Ambient temperatures are\nseldom below freezing in the w"

      "SummaryText": "inter and summer highs are over 100 degrees F several\ndays each year. Winds are still during the winter and slight breezes are typical morning\nand afternoon the remainder of the year.\n\nThe ammonia refrigeration system at Fowler Packing is of a flooded design in which liquid ammonia is used in a metal pipe evaporator coil to cool air or water to remove field heat from fresh fruit for seasonal storage. Most ammonia containing components are with-in the building structures o the facility and are isolated from the public and all unauthorized personnel.\nFacilities requiring refrigeration include the hydro-cooler, two bin rooms, four storage rooms, and a refrigerated hallway. Two screw compressors and six reciprocating compressors connected in parallel are located in a mechanical room near the northeast\ncorner of the packing and storage facility. Three evaporative condensers are located outside the north wall of the mechanical room on structural steel support stands. One high pressure receiver vessel is located inside the mechanical room and a secondary receiver is located adjacent to the mechanical room near the evaporative condensers.\n\nSuction and discharge piping is primarily located on roof areas accessible only to authorized personnel. Room evaporator coils are located in enclosed bunkers behind one wall in each room. Bin Rooms and the refrigerated hallway use suspended coils supported within the refrigerated space from the roof structure. All of the system pressure vessels and equipment are protected by pressure safety relief valves. These relief valves are piped to a safe location above the roof of the building.\nRefrigeration controls are programmable logic control (PLC) based with electric valve actuators. All critical components have redundancy, fail-safe positions for power outages, and can be operated manually if required. In the event of power failure the system design automatically maintains safe system pressures and the system restarts automatically upon\nret"
