      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to inform interested parties that Arrow Material Services (Arrow) is complying with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Accidental Release Prevention requirements: Risk Management Program under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAAA) Section 112(r).  This regulation is published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The CAA required USEPA to develop the Risk Management Program in an effort to help prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of a release should one occur.  Arrow's accidental release prevention policy involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.  This Risk Management Plan (RMP) involves the preparation of response plans that are tailored to this facility and to the emergency response services available in the community.\n\n\n\nThe Arrow Material Services - Belpre Condensate Stabilization Facility, located at 222 Dragstrip Road, Belpre, Ohio 45714, includes two (2) stabilization process units, storage tanks, tanker truck loading and unloading stations, propane storage tanks, flares and facility dock for barge loading on the Ohio River.  The site has one of the regulated substances, a flammable mixture of Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), stored in an aboveground storage tank above the RMP threshold amount.  The storage tank is located central to the facility.\n\n\n\nUnprocessed natural gas condensate will be received by truck from nearby natural gas production wells, stabilized, and loaded onto river barges for transport to customers.  The unprocessed natural gas condensate consists of a mixture of hydrocarbon liquids including hexane, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, and benzene.  Two holding tanks will provide storage capacity for the stabilized and un-stabilized natural gas condensate.  Each of these tanks can hold up to 60,000 barrels of natural gas condensate.\n\n\n\nY-Grade NGLs are pr"

NGLs will be trucked offsite on a routine basis, approximately 2-3 times per week.\n\n\n\nThe two stabilization units are designed to process 5,000 barrels of liquids per day each.  The stabilization process includes a stabilizer tower, heat exchanger, blowcase and 3-phase NGL separator.  The expected startup date of the Belpre Condensate Stabilization Facility is August 1, 2015.\n\n\n\nHazard Assessment: \n\nArrow's written hazard assessment program evaluates the hazards that may exist with storage of the NGL, assesses the risks involved, and determines ways to reduce the probability of an accidental release of NGL into the atmosphere and possible vapor explosion.  The program also provides for determination of the impact of an accidental release on public receptors and the environment.  In accordance with RMP requirements, the Arrow hazard assessment program will be reviewed and updated at least every 5 years.  \n\n\n\nOff-site Consequence Analysis:     \n\nUSEPA's RMPComp online software was used to predict the off-site consequences for both a \"worst-case\" release scenario and an \"alternative\" release scenario.  The software program provides the distance to the explosion endpoint mandated by USEPA for the worst-case and alternative releases and subsequent vapor cloud explosion.  This distance is based on an overpressure of 1 psi.   The residential population within a circle with a radius corresponding to the explosion endpoint distance is defined to estimate the population potentially affected.  USEPA's MARPLOT program was used to estimate the population within the potentially impacted areas for both the worst-case and alternate release scenarios.\n\n\n\nPrevention Program \n\nArrow's prevention program ensures that the elements of the RMP are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis, and that there is accountability and responsibility for the "

The prevention program addresses the following elements that are tailored to suit the degree of hazards present at this facility and the degree of complexity to the facility's operation.   \n\n\n\nA.    Employee Participation - Employee participation is a required element in Process Safety Management and Risk Management.  Employees have ready access to elements of the RMP Plan.  Employees involved with the operation of the natural gas condensate stabilization process and NGL storage tank receive detailed training for the activities relating to the operation and maintenance of the process.  New employees receive training prior to being allowed to operate any portion of the system.\n\nB.    Training - The intent of the training program is to increase employee awareness of the process hazards that are associated with the natural gas condensate stabilization process and NGL storage tank.  Each new employee involved with the process is trained with an overview and the proper operating procedures.  Refresher training is conducted annually and whenever a process change is made.\n\nC.    Process Safety Information - Written process safety information regarding the natural gas condensate stabilization process and NGL storage tank was compiled to enable employees involved in the operating process to identify and understand the potential hazards of the process. \n\nD.    Process Hazard Analysis - In order to identify the process hazards associated with the facility as a whole, Arrow initiated a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA).  The PHA was conducted on April 28, 2015.  The primary method of PHA selected was the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) Study.  The HAZOP Study is a scenario-based method of hazard evaluation that was developed for continuous and batch plant processes.  The HAZOP Study was judged to be an effective method of hazard evaluation for the majority of the processes being evaluated by Arrow.  A \"What-If\" nalysis was used as a secondary m"

Review and updates of the process hazard analysis will be conducted every 5 years.\n\nE.    Mechanical Integrity - Equipment used to process, store or handle natural gas condensate and NGL is designed, constructed, and maintained in order to minimize the risk of a flammable release and explosion.  The frequency of mechanical inspections depends upon the part of the system being inspected and in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nF.    Operating Procedures - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear instructions for properly conducting all activities associated with the natural gas condensate stabilization process and NGL storage tank equipment.  Operating procedures are reviewed annually for content and accuracy.\n\nG.    Management of Change - Prior to implementing a change in the natural gas condensate stabilization process and NGL storage tank operation, the change is identified, reviewed, and authorized prior to implementation.  A process change authorization is required for any changes to ensure the operating procedures contain the proper operating parameters and highlights the importance of operating within the limits.  Management of change covers changes such as process technology changes and changes to equipment and instrumentation.\n\nH.    Pre-Startup Review - Prior to startup of a changed process or affected part of the process, employees involved in operating the process, maintaining the process, and contract employees affected by a change are informed of and trained in the changes.  Additionally, process safety information and operating procedures are updated to reflect the changes necessary.\n\nI.    Contractors - Prior to starting any work on or adjacent to the natural gas condensate stabilization process equipment and NGL storage tank, contractors are required to provide detail"

They are also informed of their responsibilities to ensure that their employees receive the necessary training.  Periodic inspections of the contractor's performance are conducted to ensure safe work practices are being followed.  Documentation is maintained that the listed requirements have been met.\n\nJ.    Hot Work Permit - The hot work permits issued at the facility document that all fire prevention and protection requirements have been implemented prior to the start of any hot work operations.  Each issued permit identifies the date(s) authorized to perform the hot work and the equipment on which the hot work is to be performed, as well as site preparation and safety equipment requirements and documentation.  \n\nK.    Incident Investigation - Incidents that result in or could have resulted in a release of the flammable mixture/explosion are investigated immediately.  Each incident is investigated in an attempt to identify the root cause of the incident and to implement corrective actions to prevent future incidents.  The incident investigation elements include a description of the accident, process description, process flow diagram, recommendations and review with affected personnel.\n\nL.
