              "Description": "The following is a summary of the prevention program for Arnco is South Gate.  The TDI process is regulated by the EPA RMP, but not subject to the OSHA PSM standard.  The prevention program describes the systems/processes in place to reduce the risk of release.  To accomplish this, the facility utilizes written procedures, employee participation, visual checks and checklists, and training (hands-on, video, classroom).               Process Safety Information - Allow the all parties involved in operating the TDI process to identify and understand the hazards posed in using TDI.  Specifically, hazards of TDI, information pertaining to the technology of TDI, and information pertaining to the equipment in the TDI process.                      Process Hazard Analysis - Arnco has a dedicated and closed piping system for TDI.  Receiving and outlet lines have been considered and evaluated in a HAZOP (hazard and operability) analysis.  A nine member HAZOP team was structured, all with practical experience in operations, maintenance, engineering, environmental regulations, and corporate and industry safety standards.  The results of the HAZOP are documented and maintained.        Operating Procedures - operating procedures are in place for receiving and transferring of TDI.  Only employees with at least five (5) years experience are allowed to receive and/or transfer TDI.  This ensures that they are trained and experienced in the safe handling technology associated with TDI. Training - training begins the first day on the job and is a continuing process. Training includes, but is not limited to: 1) Indoctrination; 2) Hazard Communication; 3) Personal Protective Equipment; 4) Department of Transportation regulations; 5) Emergency Response; 6) Forklift training;         7) Evacuation; 8) Miscellaneous training according to job hazard analysis.     Maintenance - all equipment used for handling TDI and TDI containing products are maintained by an in-house mechanical technician.  Whenever maintenance in performed, a safety meeting is held before hand discussing such items as: 1) maintenance to be performed; 2) dangers associated with TDI; 3) special dangers; 4) affected employees; 5) personal protective equipment.                                                                                                          Incident Investigation - there have been no incidents/releases from the TDI process that resulted in the need for an incident investigation.  However, a handbook is in place for guidelines on how to perform an investigation, as well as a Contigency Program in the instance of a release.  An incident investigation will be performed by the Operations Manager and the Plant Manager.                                                                                                       Compliance Audit - On an annual basis, an audit team, comprised of the Plant Manager, maintenance personnel, and production crew will conduct an audit of the RMP and all other associated systems.  This audit will cover all parts of the facility having to handle TDI.                                                               Management of Change - a system has been established in order to implement written procedures to manage changes to process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures; and changes to stationary sources that affect TDI.                                                                                               Pre-Startup Review - a review will be performed by Management and maintenance personnel for new or modified stationary sources when the modification is significant enough to require a change in the process safety information.                                                                                                    Contractors - all maintenance or repair related to the TDI system is performed by in-house personnel.  For the purpose of the RMP and planned renovations of the TDI system, a contractor training program will be developed and implemented before any contractors will be allowed to work on the TDI system.                                                                                                            Employee Participation - Arnco encourges employees to participate in safety communication and accident prevention.  Employee participation consists of: 1) Safety meetings; 2) Postings; 3) Training; 4) Access to Information;           5) Reporting Health and Safety Issues.                                                            Hot Work Permit - a work permit is needed to control spark-producing activities (open flame, welding, burning, grinding, non-intrinsically safe electrical tools and instruments, work in electrical circuits, or use of spark producing devices in a classified area).  This safety procedure ensures that operations and maintenance is performed safely.",

One of the major raw material ingredients is toluene diisocyanate (TDI) unspecified isomer CAS# 26471-62-5.  TDI is the only acutely hazardous material (AHM) used in the production.  The established State Threshold Quantity for TDI unspecified isomer is not listed, but toluene-2,4-diisocyanate is 500 pounds and that of toluene-2-6-diisocyanate is 100 pounds.  The established StateToxic endpoint is .0070 mg/l.\n\nA hazard and operability (HAZOP) study was conducted by a safety team in September 1999.  The HAZOP study was based and compared to a prior study conducted on October 25, 1995.  The team consisted of facility personnel including the Operations Manager, Plant Manager, Production Crew, Maintenance Engineer, Quality Assurance Chemist and an Environmental Health and Safety consultant.  In accordance with the prior study, the guide word approach was used for HAZOP identification.  The risk matrix algorithms were utilized utilized for hazard ranking.  The existing safeguards for AHM release were identified.  Based upon the HAZOP study, certain control measures were recommended for implementation.  \n\nA total of four external event categories were evaluated; they were transportation accidents, fire, flooding, and nearby pipelines.  It was concluded that external events posted no risk to the normal operations in the plant.\n\nThe off-site consequence analysis was conducted to evaluate the health and environmental impacts associated with the potential acute impacts of an accident.  Data from the Aloha model (developed by EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association for predicting the dispersion of toxic material releases in air) determined the worst-case and alternative release endpoint distance for TDI releases. \n\nOne worst case scenario was modeled.  The worst case was assumed to be a rupture of the 5,000-gallon TDI storage tank, regardless of i"

The alternative case was assumed to be a pipe leak of 50-gallons, regardless of its cause or likelihood.\n\n\n\nFACILITY DESCRIPTION\nArnco's facility is in South Gate, California and produces three main varieties of tire-fill:  Permacor, Re-pneu, and Superflex.  These three products account for over 85 percent of the volume of goods produced at this facility. \n\nThe main building was designed and built in 1951.  The property was leased from Sheldon Angel Enterprises in 1974.  The contact person is Mr. Howard Sheldon or Mr. Luis Angel at (310) 670-0811.  Arnco currently employs 24 people in South Gate, 7 people in production and 17 in the office.  There is only one shift and employees are in the plant from 4 AM until 4 PM daily, Monday to Friday.  Both Schultz and DSL, two immediate neighbors, operate 24 hours a day and have private security and CCTV cameras on the premises.  There is always activity around Arnco.  The South Gate facility is Arnco's headquarters.\n\nArnco's building currently occupies 22,500 ft2 on a 45,000 ft2 lot.  The building is located at 5141 Firestone Place in the City of South Gate, California, approximately 1,700 ft west of the 710 Freeway and 300 ft north of Firestone Boulevard.  Included in this RMP is a neighborhood site map showing the M-3 heavy manufacturing zone in which Arnco is located. \n\nTDI is a water-white to pale yellow liquid under room temperature.  The approximate vapor pressure at 200 C is 0.01 mm.  TDI slowly produces CO2 and polyureas when reacted with water.  Inhalation exposure and ingestion of TDI will cause strong irritation to skin and tissue, especially to the eyes.  The current Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) time weighted average (TWA) is 0.005 ppm."
