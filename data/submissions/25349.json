IA ? 50247\nContact:    Dave Eggers \nPhone:        641-483-2772 or 641- 483-2454\n\n1.    Facility Policy.\n    \n    The owners of Elder-Eggers Fertilizer are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the State Center Fire Department (641-483-2559), Marshall County Emergency Management Agency (641-754-6385) or other authorities, to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release to the people and the environment.  \n    \n2.    Facility Information.\n\nThe primary activity at the facility is the storage Anhydrous Ammonia fertilizers for sale to farmers.  Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is stored at the facility in 1 storage tank (30, 000 gallons). \n\nThe maximum quantity stored would be 223,000 pounds. \n\n3.    Worst-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario\n\na.    The worst-case scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as gas over a period of 10 minutes.  The maximum quantity released would be 131,00 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 percent capacity as limited by design standards.  The distance to the rural end point (point of dispersion to 200 parts per million, or ppm) is 5.6 miles. The estimated population within this distance is estimated to be 2100 people. Within this distance to the end point are located schools, residences, public recreation areas, nursing home, and commercial property and wildlife sanctuaries. \n\nb.    The alternate release scenario, based on the five-year accident history (or the most likely potential incident), is a release from a break in a transfer hose.  The distance to the rural endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 3.1 miles. The estimated p"

Within this distance to the end point are located schools, residences, public recreation areas, nursing home, and commercial property. \n\n\n \n\n4.    Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nTo help prevent against either of these events happening, breakaway couplings are sued on the fill hoses to prevent against hose rupture should someone pull away with a tank that is being filled. Valves to the main tank are covered and locked. Excess flow valves are used on the main tank. \n\nAll of the facility is kept up to date with regards to the Iowa Department of Agriculture Inspections. \n\nThe facility has been reviewed for general compliance with the provisions of ?Safety Requirements for the Storage and handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1?, published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI), and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, ?Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia?.  The ANSI Standard has been adopted by reference by Iowa Administrative Code Part 21?Chapter 43?Rule 43.6(200)-Standard for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The OSHA standard is referenced in the Registration Form Section 8.3.b.\n\n5.    Five-Year Accident History.        \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: have caused any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility; nor to our knowledge, have resulted in off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage, or environmental damage.  \n\n6.    Emergency Response Program.\n\n    The facility has:\n\na.    A written action plan, in accordance with OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.38;\n\nb.    Provided state and local authorities with the emergency planning and community right-to-know information as required under SARA Title III (EPCRA).\n\n7.    Planned Changes to Improve Safety.\n\nSafety improvement is an on-going process at the facility.  Periodic eva"
