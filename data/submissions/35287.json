              "Description": "EPS is manufactured in a 1-step batch process by free-radical initiated suspension polymerization of styrene.  Water is the suspension media used in the reaction.  It is pumped into any one of five (5) batch reactors (E-R-14, E-R-15, E-R-16, E-R-17, E-R-18) located in Building 4.  Liquid styrene is then pumped from on-site tank farm storage to the reactor. Free radical initiators, suspending agents, and other additives are added to the reactor. Reactor contents are heated to initiate the polymerization then cooled to control the temperature of the exothermic reaction once it has begun for the duration of the polymerization.  As the styrene polymerizes it forms small polystyrene beads approximately 1,000 microns in diameter.  During the styrene addition to the reactor and the polymerization reaction, the reactor vapors are vented through a condenser to a flare system.  At the conclusion of the polymerization reaction, the reactor is isolated from the flare system and liquid pentane is pumped from on-site tank farm storage into the reactor.  Pentane vaporizes in the reactor generating pressure that causes pentane to diffuse into the polystyrene beads.  In addition, reactor temperature in increased to improve pentane diffusion and to polymerize trace amounts of remaining styrene.\nAt the conclusion of pentane diffusion, the reactor is cooled and the water/EPS bead slurry is discharged to the reactor?s given storage tank commonly called a wash tank (E-T-14, E-T-15, E-T-16, E-T-17, E-T-18) and the reactor is prepared for the next batch to be produced.  Reactors are used sequentially as batches are completed to allow as near continuous operation as possible.\nThe water/EPS bead slurry is pumped from the wash tank to one of five (5) centrifuges (E-K-07, E-K-08, E-K-09, E-K-10, E-K-11) where the EPS beads are separated from the water.\nThe de-watered EPS beads are vacuum conveyed to and dried in one of five (5) drier systems (E-D-07, E-D-08, E-D-09, E-D-10, E-D-11).\nDried EPS beads are pressure conveyed to and screened to segregate them by size in one of three (3) screening systems.\nScreened EPS beads are pressure conveyed to packaging bins (J-BI-A, J-BI-B, J-BI-01, J-BI-02, J-BI-03, J-BI-04, J-BI-05, J-BI-06, J-BI-07, J-BI-08, J-BI-09, J-BI-10) in the packaging area.\nScreened EPs beads are mixed with powdered lubricating external additives and packaged for shipment to customers.\n\nEPS can also be manufactured in a 2-step process that varies from the 1-step process in that polystyrene beads previously formed and screened or micropellets (neither containing pentane) are added to a reactor with water.  The mixture is heated, pentane is added, and pentane diffusion takes place as in the 1-step process.   Processing after the reactor is the same as the 1-step process with the exception that no screening is necessary because the polystyrene beads or micropellets added to the reactor at the start of the process were previously screened or produced to the appropriate size.\n\nEach reactor is vented to the flare system through a vent condenser.  Each reactor also has an atmospheric vent that can be used during sampling reactor contents or making manual additions of chemicals to the reactor.  Each reactor has a rupture disk that vents outside the process area and an emergency discharge valve that can be used to empty reactor contents to a containment area.\nThe wash tanks are normally operated under a slight positive pressure and are vented to the flare system.  Each wash tank is also equipped with a manually activated vent to atmosphere and a manually operated drain valve.\n\nExhaust from each of the centrifuge systems and dryer systems are vented through centrifuges to prevent discharge of EPS beads.\n\nWastewater that is separated from the EPS beads is discharged through a process wastewater sump to the plant?s wastewater treatment system.",

              "Description": "Building 2 - The manufacturing of performance resins(PR) is similar to the\nother RMP covered process EPS. PR is manufactured in Building 2.\nVarious polystyrene blends are conveyed from storage bins/silos into\nbead bins above the reactors. The beads are then charged in the\nreactors (A-R-07 and A-R-08), along with water and process additives\ndesigned to impart particular physical properties to the material. Pentane\nblowing agent is added to the reactor from the blowing agent charge tand\n(A-V-BA). The reactor is pressuized using nitrogen and heated to\ncomplete the impregnation process. The impregnated slurry is conveyed\nfrom the reactors to the wash tanks (A-T-07 and A-T-08). From the wash\ntanks, the bead slurry is pumped to a centrifuge (A-K-03 and A-K-04),\nwhere the performance resin beads are dewatered. The beads are then\nconveyed to one of two low-temperature dryers (A-D-03 and A-D-04).\nFrom the dryers, the beads are transferred to storage bins (D-BI-01, D-BI-\n02, D-BI-03, D-BI-04, D-BI-05, D-BI-06, D-BI-07, and D-BI-08). From the\nstorage bins, the beads are screened to separate over/undersized beads.\nAn external lubrication is applied and the beads are packaged into\ncontainers. The PR reactors are equipped with vent condensers that are\nalso considered recovery devices. The wash tanks are power exhausted\nto a vent outside the building. Centrifuge A-K-03 vents inside the building\nwhile the emissions from the centrifuge A-K-04 are routed through a vent\nouside the building. Both dryers are equipped with cyclones (A-CY-D03\nand A-CY-D04) to control particulate emissions.",

General accidental release prevention program and chemical specific prevention steps.\nFollowing is a brief summary of the elements that Huntsman's Peru Site has implemented to comply with the\naccidental release prevention requirements outlined by the EPA as well as with the Occupational Health and\nSafety Administration (OSHA) process safety management (PSM) standard.\n- Process Safety Information\nHuntsman's Peru Site maintains a compilation of current and accurate written safety information to identify and\nunderstand the hazards of the process. This includes information pertaining to:\n- Hazards of regulated substances: For each regulated substance, there is a Material Safety Data Sheet\n(MSDS) which discusses the physical properties of the chemicals, exposure hazards, the required personal\nprotective equipment and the appropriate f irst aid and emergency treatment for exposure.\n- The technology of the process: Includes a discussion of process chemistry, safe upper and lower limits of\ntemperature and pressure and analysis of consequences of deviation.\n- Equipment in the process: Includes such information as materials of construction, diagrams of the piping and\ninstrumentation, safety systems and design codes.\n- Process Hazard Analysis\nHuntsman's Peru Site has performed process hazard analysis on each process to identify the potential hazards,\nthe adequacy of the engineering and adminstrative controls and the ways to minimize those hazards. The Peru\nSite typically utilizes the HAZOP methodology, a recognized and generally accepted method, for identifying and\nevaluating hazards in the process. The Peru Site assigns employees to the HAZOP team who are\nknowledgeable in the HAZOP methodology and the specific process. The HAZOP team develops\nrecommendations to reduce the potential hazards which, if approved, are implemented within a reasonable\nperiod of time.

The procedures\naddress steps for all operating phases, safety systems, control measures, and precautions to prevent\nexposures to process hazards. The procedures are reviewed and revised periodically to ensure their accuracy\nand completeness.\n- Training\nHuntsman Peru provides initial training as well as refresher training to employees to assure that the required\nlevel of skills and knowledge are maintained. The training emphasizes safety and health hazards, emergency\noperations, and safe work practices. All operators receive periodic refresher training.\n- Mechanical Integrity\nHuntsman Peru has developed written procedures for maintaining the operative components of the process\n(including pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown\nsystem controls, and pumps) through the mechanical integrity program. The program is comprised of well trained\npersonnel who follow maintenance, testing and inspection procedures that ensure proper function of process equipment.\n- Management of Change\nHuntsman Peru has established and implemented written procedures to manage changes to process\nchemicals, technology, equipment, procedures, and any changes to the facility that af fect a covered process.\nThe procedures assure that, prior to any change, the following issues are considered: the technical basis for the\nproposed change, its impact on safety and health, any modifications to operating procedures, the necessary\ntime period for the change, and any authorization requirements.
