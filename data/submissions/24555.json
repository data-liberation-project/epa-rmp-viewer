Anhydrous ammonia, the refrigerant used in this process, is regulated by EPA under 40CFR part 68 and by OSHA under 29CFR 1910.119.  We have specific programs and practices in place for controlling this process to help ensure that a harmful release of this substance does not occur.  These programs and practices include:\n\n-Use of recognized good engineering practices in the design, installation and operation of our refrigeration equipment and ensuring this equipment meets OSHA standards and ASME codes.\n-Continual assessment of hazards and safeguards in our process, so we can minimize risks.\n-Use of release prevention practices that have been recognized as effective by Federal and State experts.\n-Maintaining preparedness and contingency plans for responding to any emergency that may occur and coordinating these plans with local response agencies.\n\nUsing EPA-approved methods and technology, we have determined that the worst-case release of ammonia from our Refrigeration Process, represented by loss of the full contents of our Receiver would cause approximately 17,000 pounds of ammonia to be emitted to atmosphere.  Although very unlikely, if that release were to occur, it could impact a portion of a circular area with a radius of 1.5 miles surrounding our site that includes industrial sites and residences having a population of 40 people (1990 US Census).  There would be no impact on EPA - specified environmental receptors.  If a release occurred under normal operating conditions, despite our prevention practices, the area impacted is reduced to about 0.6 mile radius from our site that includes industrial sites and a population of 10 people (1990 census).\n\nOur release prevention program focuses on preventing hazardous releases of anhydrous ammonia.  Our equipment and management practices are consistent with recognized good engineering practices, OSHA regulati"

If such a release were to occur, however, monitoring devices would immediately alert us so that quick action can be taken to minimize the impact.  These and other activities are part of our Emergency Contingency Plan that is coordinated with local Fire Department and Emergency Response agencies.\n\nOur policy is to continually seek ways to improve the safety of our operations.  Consistent with that policy, our Orlando facility has been designed to include the latest in safety and environmental protection advancements in place at similar facilities that we operate throughout the USA.  As evidence of this commitment, we completed a process hazard analysis in July 2001 and are actively resolving recommendations from that analysis.  Our Process Safety and Risk Management Procedures and Emergency Response Plan are in place and being used to manage hazards and control risks associated with regulated materials and processes at our facility.  Operating procedures and mechanical integrity practices have been reviewed are being updated.  We will continue to monitor our operations to identify ways to maintain a leadership position in environmental, health and safety practices"
