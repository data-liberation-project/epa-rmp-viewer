The health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities and prevention of pollution are among Sealed Air's primary concerns. Sealed Air is committed to providing safe working conditions for our employees, to promoting the safe design, use, and handling of Sealed Air products and to complying with laws relating to the protection of the environment. Each employee is expected to promote these goals in his or her tasks. We also work toward safety and environmental excellence as an integral part of our World Class Manufacturing program.\n\nEach Division General Manager has ultimate responsibility for the administration of EHS\nprograms and regulatory compliance; however, compliance with this Policy is the responsibility of every Sealed Air employee.\n\nThe plant has a multi-faceted safety programs that support public health, safety and\nenvironmental issues. These programs include employee education and training combined with physical prevention. One of the cornerstone programs for flammable materials is the Process Safety Management program.\n\nYour facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nOverview of Process:\n\nThe Sealed Air Corporation Scotia facility manufactures polyethylene foam products used as packaging or recreational material. The foam is polyethylene material with bubbles encased within sheets, or blocks. These bubbles within the foam are called cells.\n\nPolyethylene foam sheets, planks, rounds, etc. are produced using an extruder. The extruder performs three distinct functions: melts and plasticizes the polyethylene (polymer), disperses and mixes th"

The blowing agent is pumped into the extruder under pressure. Once the polyethylene / blowing agent mixture leaves the die, and the mixture is no longer under pressure, the blowing agent vaporizes and begins to expand the material into foam.\n\nOverview of Blowing Agent System:\n\nThe blowing agents are stored in approved pressure vessels as non-odorized liquid petroleum under pressure (under 150 psi). The liquid is pumped at low pressure to the plant's high pressure pumps. A metering station regulates and controls the flow of the blowing agent into the injection port of the extruder. The facility has two blowing agent tanks rated for 250 psi (30,000-gallons and 3900 gallons.).\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThe plant has a multi-faceted safety program that supports health, safety, and environmental issues. One of the more in-depth programs is Process Safety Management of highly hazardous chemicals that was promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor (29 CFR 1910.119). The purpose of this requirement is to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps\ninclude mitigation, prevention and abatement procedures. These include:\n\nA. Employee education and training:\na)All employees receive initial and yearly refresher training in our Hazardous         Commutation program, and spill and emergency spill response plans.\nb)The production and maintenance personnel are trained to operate the blowing agent systems under safety procedures outlined in the plant's Process Safety Management program.\n\nB.

An accidental release is a spill of 500 pounds or more.\n\nThe emergency response program:\n\nSealed Air Corporations Scotia, New York facility has in place numerous safety programs and safety systems to mitigate the consequence of any reasonable release scenario. Of those programs, an active employee and management safety committee is an ongoing program of constant improvement, in how we deal on a daily basis with both chemical and work place hazards. Systems in place to reduce the likelihood of a release of regulated substances include both electronic monitoring and mechanical devices which will reduce the risk of a release. In addition to the aforementioned devices this facility is regulated under the OSHA process safety management which gives a system of checks and balances to monitor the risk. In the event of a release it is the policy of Sealed Ai"
