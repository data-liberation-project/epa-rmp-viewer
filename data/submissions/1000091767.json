Lake Charles Chemical Complex\r\nRisk Management Plan\r\nExecutive Summary\r\n\r\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, training of qualified personnel, and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent chemical releases. However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control, contain, and mitigate the release.\r\n\r\nSasol's Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) located in Westlake, Louisiana uses natural gas and by-products from refinery operations to produce specialty chemicals for detergents and cosmetics. The chemical complex uses or produces several regulated flammables such as ethylene, propane, butane, propylene, ethane, butane, hydrogen, methane, and pentane. Chemicals maintained on site at the LCCC listed on the EPA's list of toxic chemicals and are above EPA's threshold quantity are Chlorine, Ethylene Oxide, Dimethyldichlorosilane and Hydrogen Fluoride. \r\n\r\nProcess Safety Information\r\n\r\nThe LCCC (Lake Charles Chemical Complex) maintains a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis/configuration information. Specific departments within the chemical complex are assigned responsibility for maintaining up-to-date process safety information. Employees are provided training on how to locate the information from various computer terminals located throughout the chemical complex.\r\n\r\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure considerations, is provided in safety data sheets (SDS).

For the different process areas, the chemical complex has documented safety related limits for specific process parameters (e.g. temperature, pressure, composition, etc.). The chemical complex ensures that the processes are maintained within the limits using process controls, monitoring instruments, protective instrument systems, and highly trained personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemical complex also maintains an electronic database, that is accessible by both employees and contractor supervision, which provides information about the design pressure and temperature ratings, electrical classification, etc. This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\r\n\r\nProcess Hazard Analysis\r\n\r\nThe Lake Charles Chemical Complex (LCCC) has a comprehensive program to help ensure the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systemically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\r\n\r\nThe LCCC primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis technique to perform these evaluations and the What-if/Checklist method for Process Hazard Analysis revalidations. The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise. The team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe PHA team findings are made available to people associated"

Oral review and written tests are used to verify that employees understand the training before an employee can resume work in the process. The operators have been consulted in safety meetings and through questionnaires regarding effectiveness and frequency of training. Recommendations are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\r\n\r\nManagement of Change (MOC)\r\n\r\nThe Management of Change program for the LCCC evaluates and approves all proposed changes to chemicals, equipment, and procedures for covered processes to help ensure that a change does not negatively affect safe operations. Process changes that are determined to be a replacement in kind (e.g. replacing a valve with an identical valve) are allowed without completing a full management of change program.
