Anhydrous ammonia is utilized as a refrigerant at this facility for freezing prepared seafood products prior to packaging and for our cold storage warehouse.  The PSM and RMP (Prevention Program 3) enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of anhydrous ammonia as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage because they focus on rules, standard operating procedures, and safe practices for ammonia refrigeration processes and equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at this facility.\n\n\n\nOur highly hazardous chemical, Ammonia (anhydrous), CAS # 7664-41-7, is considered to be a toxic gas.  We use up to 24,000 lbs of ammonia liquefied under pressure.  The ammonia is contained within an enclosed building but should it escape our building it would come into direct contact with the outside air.  Our facility is located in an urban area and has many obstacles in the immediate area.  According to the 2010 US Census data for our geographic area, there is between 5,000 and 9,999 people per square mile.  Assuming a release duration of 10 minutes at a release rate of 1,320 pounds per minute and using the worse-case scenario assumptions of wind speed at 1.5 meters/second with a stability cla"

In the past five years, we have had one release incident, estimated 80 lbs, which occurred on August 11, 2009 and caused the evacuation of approximately 100 of our employees.  This release incident did not cause death, injury, hospitalization or property damage. \n\n\n\nWe currently have an active emergency response program that includes response by our trained employees and in the case of a catastrophic release includes the services of our regional HazMat response team.  Emergency response preparedness is maintained through the maintenance of our Emergency Action Plan (EAP), intense employee training and routine evacuation drills.  \n\n\n\nFor additional information, please contact:\n\n\n\nDawn M.
