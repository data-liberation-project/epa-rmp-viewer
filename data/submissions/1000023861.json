This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various operations are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each portion of the facility is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and Checklist method analysis techniques to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the terminal periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.

Once again, the responses to the team findings are also documented and retained.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nThe Jackson Terminal maintains written procedures that address various modes of storage and terminal operations such as; (1) start-up, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency shutdown, (5) normal shutdown and (6) initial startup of any new equipment.  These procedures provide guidance for experienced operators and also provide the basis for training new operators.  Operating procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate.  The review and certification process involves both operators and technical staff.\n\nThe intent of the operating procedures is to provide workable, useful and clearly written instructions for conducting operating activities.  To have effective operating procedures, the task and procedures directly and indirectly related to the covered process must be appropriate, clear, consistent and most importantly communicated to employees.  Operating procedures are specific instructions or details on what steps are taken or followed in carrying out the stated procedures.  The specific instructions include the applicable safety precautions and appropriate information on safety implications.\n\nTanker loading operations at the terminal are primarily carried out by each individual transport truck driver.  Drivers are required to show that they understand the procedures required to safely load their trucks before they are allowed to load propane at the Jackson Terminal.  When a company technician is not present at the facility, access is blocked by a loading rack access gate.  Truck drivers must demonstrate knowledge of proper loading and safety procedures before they are issued an access code number that allows them to open the gate and access the terminal loading racks.\n\nTraining\n\nIn addition to"

New employees receive basic training in pipeline, storage and terminal operations.  In addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure that their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.  This refresher training is conducted at lease every three years.  All of this training is documented for each operator including the means to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\nAs has been noted earlier, the Jackson Terminal is a normally unoccupied remote facility.  Company technicians are present at the facility from time to time to monitor pipeline transfer operations, to perform basic safety checks and inspections and to check on and address any reported equipment problems.\n \nContractors\n\nThe Jackson Terminal uses contractors during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near the terminal storage and loading equipment, the terminal has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards of their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site specific safety rules and (6) inform terminal personnel of any hazards that they find while performing their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with an orientation session that covers (1) a process overview, (2) information about the safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements and (4) safe work practices prior to beginning their work.

This system requires that changes to items such as terminal equipment, technology (including terminal operating conditions), procedures and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and to verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel are provided any necessary training on the changes.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nThe Jackson Terminal promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in, a fire/explosion, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to gather the facts, determine the root cause, and develop corrective action to prevent the reoccurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendation(s) to prevent a reoccurrence and forwards these results to the business management team for resolution.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nTo help ensure that the accident prevention program is functioning properly, Enterprise periodically conducts an audit to determine whether the procedures and practices required by the accident prevention program are being implemented.

Over the past five years there have been no large or small releases, with no injuries or offsite consequences.  \n\n\nEmergency Procedures Information\n\nThe Jackson Terminal maintains a written emergency procedure, which is in place to protect employee, truck driver and public safety as well as the environment.  The procedures are for the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address notification of local emergency response agencies if a release occurs.  Employees receive training in emergency procedures.  The emergency procedure is updated when necessary based on modifications made to the terminal facilities.  The emergency procedure changes are administered through the Management of Change process.\n\nThe overall emergency procedure program for the Jackson Terminal is coordinated with the Jackson County Fire Department.  The Jackson Terminal has around-the-clock communications capability with the Jackson County Fire Department, which provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident.  In addition to providing information on the emergency plan to the fire department, the Jackson Terminal conducts periodic site orientations that involve the emergency responders, and also provides periodic refresher training to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances in the terminal.

The propane is received from an Enterprise underground pipeline and is stored in nine above ground storage tanks.  The tanks  are equipped with automatic level indicators and alarms and automatic inlet propane shutoff valves to allow for unattended filling from a remote pipeline control facility.  Ethyl mercaptan is added to the propane during the tank filling operation as an odorant to aid in propane leak detection. The stored propane is transferred from the storage bullet tanks into highway transport trucks for delivery of the propane to wholesale customers.    The trace odorant remains present in the propane when it is loaded into the transport trucks.  The flammable ethyl mercaptan at the facility is never present above the threshold quantity specified in the RMP regulation.  \n\nThe Jackson Terminal was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic substances exceeded the threshold quantity.

These programs include regularly scheduled safety meeting, tail-gate safety meetings, hazard communications, Safety Suggestion Forms, a near-miss reporting system and special training programs such as emergency response training, first aid training, etc.\n\nEnterprise actively seeks employee involvement in the development and conduct of all accident prevention activities through the appropriate existing safety programs.  Accident prevention is discussed at the regularly scheduled safety meetings and/or during special training sessions if necessary.  Employees are encouraged to discuss accident prevention with their supervisors and to bring any questions, comments or suggestions forward for open discussion.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nComplete and accurate written process safety information concerning process chemicals, process technology and process equipment is essential to an effective PSM and RMP program as well as completing and maintaining a process hazard analysis.  The process safety information will be useful to the operators, the team performing a process hazard analysis and those in charge of updating the emergency preparedness plans.  Process safety information is readily available to all employees.  Enterprise keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain a safe operating process.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemicals inventories and equipment design basis/configuration information.\n\nChemical specific information, including exposure hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations is provided in material safety data sheets (MSDS).\n\nEnterprise also maintains numerous technical documents that provide information about the design and construction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipm"

      "SummaryText": "tractors are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR)\n\nThe Jackson Terminal conducts a PSSR on any new facility or facility modification that requires a change in process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety features, procedures, personnel and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing the equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The PSSR involves field verification of the construction and serves a quality assurance function by requiring verification that accident prevention program requirements are properly implemented.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has well established practices and procedures for maintaining process equipment.  The basic aspects of this program include (1) training, (2) developing written procedures, (3) performing inspections and tests, (4) correcting equipment deficiencies, when identified and (5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process.\n\nEnterprise incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made.\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe Jackson Terminal has long standing safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: (1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, (2) a lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sources for equipment undergoing maintenance, (3) a procedure for safe removal of hazardous substances before process piping and equipment is opened, (4) a permit and procedure to control spark-producing activities (i.e., hot work) and (5) a permit and pro"
