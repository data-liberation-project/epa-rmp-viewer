Alta Pueblo is a non-responding facility for releases of the RMP-listed chemicals, so the site utilizes an Emergency Action Plan (EAP).\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe Alta Fuels (Alta) Pueblo, Colorado facility is a gasoline blending facility with approximately 400,000 gallons of capacity, blending diesel, ethanol, and blend stock gasoline. The daily average finished product fuel throughput is 150,000 gallons, with a maximum daily throughput of 320,000 gallons. The Pueblo facility has two permanent 30,000-gallon field grade butane tanks for blending. \n\nAlta Fuels Pueblo uses a flammable mixture (field grade butane) containing three chemicals (n-butane, isobutane, and butene) that are subject to reporting under this filing to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The field grade butane is stored in two permanent 30,000-gallon tanks used to inject field grade butane into their gasoline loading operations for blending. Each tank is administratively controlled to an 85% level limit, has excess flow valves on the vapor and liquid lines and has three (3) pressure relief valves. Field grade butane is unloaded from a tank wagon into either tank and stored liquefied under pressure; the tanks are manifolded such that one can be online while the other is being filled. Liquid field grade butane is pumped from the online tank through a loading rack meter to an inline mixer where it is blended with gasoline immediately prior to loading the outbound gasoline tank wagons.\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nAlta Fuels has a"

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is HAZOP. The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least every 5 years. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nWritten Operating Procedures [40 CFR Part 68.69]\nTo ensure safe operations, Alta Fuels maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations and normal shutdown. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nEmployee Training [40 CFR Part 68.71]\nAlta Fuels has a training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating plant processes are competent in the applicable operating procedures. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity [40 CFR Part 68.73]\nAlta Fuels carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Inspected process equipment includes pressure vessels, piping systems, pressure relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.

Facility operators or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification(s).\n\nPre-Startup Safety Review [PSSR] [40 CFR Part 68.77]\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and modifications to existing processes are conducted routinely at Alta Fuels. These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating, and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits [40 CFR Part 68.79]\nAlta Fuels conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the US EPA RMP and OSHA PSM regulations are being implemented. These audits are conducted at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a timely manner.\n\nIncident Investigation [40 CFR Part 68.81]\nAlta Fuels investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance within 48 hours. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.
