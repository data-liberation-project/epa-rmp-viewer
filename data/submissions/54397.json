      "SummaryText": "E.W Brown Generation Station, Kentucky Utilities, Mercer County, Kentucky, operates an inlet cooling system. This system uses approximately 32,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two separate ice thermal storage tanks. Engineers and company officials have reviewed relevant data from other existing systems to assist them with engineering design and mitigation techniques. This process is repquired to comply with 40 CFR part 68, Clean Air Act Amendments, Risk Management Plans. KU has developed a Risk Management and Process Safety Management Program to inform employees and management of the required procedures to maintain a safe operation.\n\nThis System is a closed-loop system with automatic shutdown activation. KU has trained process operators and emergency response team members should an emergency occur. Procedures that are in place to assist with quick mitigation of this type of release include: two operators performing this function so that if release occurs, isolation upstream can occur, radio communication to the control panel operator; trained emergency response personnel; and control panel operators recognizing a change in pressure. This process is also designed with an automatic shutdown system. Control panels will be monitored by trained personnel aiding in a quick response. Equipment used to process, store, and handle ammonia are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases.  \n\nKU's computerized maintenance management system enables personnel to provide continuous maintenance. The maintenance system is computerized and encompasses all phases of maintenance management including problem reporting, resouce scheduling, generation of prevention maintenance work orders, equipment database and complete equipment history. Safe operation of the system is a common goal for all E.W. Brown employees. This effort is supported through programs described previously and the involvement of plant management in development and implementation o"
