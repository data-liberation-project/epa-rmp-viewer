The cold storage facility was designed and constructed in accordance with the applicable Uniform Building and Uniform Mechanical Codes.  \n\nAdditionally, Hronis, Inc. has developed and implemented a process safety management (PSM) program for the refrigeration systems.  As part of the PSM program, Hronis, Inc. completed process hazard analyses.  Hronis, Inc. utilizes contractors to implement a preventative maintenance program and mechanical integrity program to ensure that the refrigeration equipment is maintained in good operating condition.  Properly maintained equipment reduces the risk of an accidental release.\n\nPersonnel from Hronis, Inc. monitor the daily operation of the refrigeration systems.  All service, maintenance, and repairs to the ammonia refrigeration systems are contracted to a qualified and licensed refrigeration contractor specializing in ammonia refrigeration.  Utilizing an experienced qualified contractor to perform routine service, maintenance, and repairs ensures that the equipment is in excellent operating condition. \n\nWhile it is Hronis, Inc.\u00bfs objective to be a responsible citizen of the community in all of its business activities, the limited staff at the cold storage facility precludes emergency response operations.  As such, an emergency action plan has been prepared for the Hronis, Inc. cold storage facility and a chain of command to respond to emergencies has been established.\n\nHronis, Inc. has developed a detailed Compliance Audit Checklist which is used to evaluate compliance with the Process Safety Management (PSM) and CalARP regulations.  At least every three years, Hronis, Inc. audits these programs and any f"

Delano is the closest city to the Hronis, Inc. cold storage facility.  The rural plant was originally constructed during 1980 utilizing all new equipment at the time of construction.  Several expansions to the refrigeration system have been completed with the latest expansion completed in 2005.  Figure 3.1 shows the location of the facility. \n\nRefrigeration System #1 consists of a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, five compressors, two evaporative condensers, a high pressure receiver, 6 pre-cool rooms, 7 cold storage rooms, and the associated hallway/loadout dock areas.  Refrigeration System #2 has a suction accumulator with a liquid transfer system, two compressors, one evaporative condenser, a high pressure receiver, 2 cold storage rooms, and the associated hallway/loadout dock areas.  Volume I, Section II of the PSM Supporting Document describes the ammonia refrigeration processes in detail.     \n\nDuring normal operation, the anhydrous ammonia is distributed throughout the refrigeration systems.  However, during major maintenance activities, an entire refrigeration system can be \u00bfpumped down\u00bf to evacuate the ammonia from the system and store it in the high pressure receiver.  The maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver in Refrigeration System #1 is 19,428 pounds.  In Refrigeration System #2, the maximum quantity of ammonia that can be stored in the high pressure receiver is 12,723 pounds (although current ammonia charge is approximately 7800 pounds).\n\nThe characteristics and hazards of anhydrous ammonia are discussed briefly in Section 6.0 of this document and more extensively in Volume I, Section II of the PSM Supporting Document.  For purposes of the offsite"
