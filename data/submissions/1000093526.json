This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as personnel training and consideration of safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of the Ammonia Refrigeration System. Boskovich Farms policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances. \r\n\r\n1.2\tStationary Source and Regulated Substance\r\nThe Boskovich Farms facility is listed as 711 Diaz Avenue, Oxnard, California 93030.  The regulated substance managed at the facility is anhydrous ammonia.  For documenting purposes, the facility will report the \"maximum intended inventory\" as 27,870 pounds (lbs.) of anhydrous ammonia. Refer to Process Safety Information section for related ammonia inventory calculations and information.\r\n\r\n1.3\tHazard Assessment Summary/Offsite Consequence Analysis\r\nWorst-Case Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nIn accordance with CalARP Regulations, one worst-case analysis has been defined and modeled for the Ammonia Refrigeration System. The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the CalARP Program Level 3 Compliance Workbook (Compliance Workbook).\r\n\r\nAlternative Release Scenario Results Summary\r\nAn alternative release scenario was modeled in accordance with applicable regulations.  The results can be found in the Hazard Assessment documentation located behind the Hazard Assessment tab of the Compliance Workbook.\r\n\r\nRisk Considerations\r\nAlthough the storage and use of anhydrous ammonia has inherent potential risks, and worst-case release scenarios can potentially reach the community; Boskovich Farms has recognized these potential risks and structured its safety programs to make the worst case type of event non-credible.  In addition to the safety practices of the company and plant personnel to make this worst-case event non-credible,"

Furthermore, common industry standards, policies, and procedures are currently utilized to ensure safe practices are being performed. The facility maximum intended inventory of anhydrous ammonia is 27,870 lbs.  Therefore, the regulated substance is over the 500-lbs. state threshold for the CalARP Program.

This facility will rely upon the local emergency hazardous materials response team and the LA County Fire Department for responses to uncontrolled releases of anhydrous ammonia.  In accordance with 19 CCR \u00a72765.1, the facility is not required to have an Emergency Response Plan in place.  However, it is required to have appropriate mechanisms in place for notifying emergency responders when there is a need for response.
