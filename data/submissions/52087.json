      "SummaryText": "This executive summary is a brief overview of the Risk Management Program and the associated policies at the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC) Frederick Compressor Station (Station). The station is subject to the OSHA PSM standard.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention and Response\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention. APC has an extensive operator and maintenance training program.  Safety is a major concern in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. APC?s policy is to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of hazardous materials.  However, if a release does occur, personnel are trained on how to respond to such emergencies.  If the situation requires, will notify, cooperate with, and support the various emergency response agencies. \n\nLocation and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Frederick Compressor Station is located in Weld County about five and one half (5 ?) miles north to Highway #52 at the town of Ft. Lupton. Follow highway #52 west out of Ft. Lupton three and one half (3 ?) miles to road 19, go south on road 19 one and one half (1 ?) miles to station. \n\nThe Station consists of two compressor units, #41 and #42, that discharge 60 MMCF/D through glycol dehydration to delivery points via 16\" and 20\" cleanable pipelines. The discharge pressure is not to exceed 1,220 psig. The station is equipped with inlet separation. Liquids separated (water and heavy hydrocarbons) go into five 225 barrel storage tanks.\n\nThe purpose of the compressor station is to increase the pressure of the gas being transported in the pipelines and to reduce the dew point of the gas to a level that is acceptable for pipeline transmission.  Each compressor receives gas from various gathering lines and supplies the pipeline(s) that transport the gas to a processing plant. Control of the dew point is critical since th"

      "SummaryText": "e incoming gas contains moisture (water and heavy hydrocarbons) that need to be removed.  The amount of moisture in the gas varies from day to day depending on a great number of variables at the wells. The dew point increases as the concentration of moisture in the inlet gas increases.\n\nAs gas flows through the pipeline, its temperature will decrease to about the same temperature as the surrounding environment.  If this temperature is below the dew point of the gas, the water and heavy hydrocarbons will tend to condense.  The resulting formation of liquids can begin to restrict gas flow, particularly at orifices and bends in the pipe.  In extreme cold, the liquids may form hydrates, a potentially dangerous ice plug.  In order to reduce the dew point of the gas and potential formation of hydrates, the inlet gas flows through a ?slug catcher? and ?inlet separator? physically separating the liquids. The gas is then compressed which causes some of the heavy hydrocarbons to condense out of the stream resulting in a lower dew point.  These condensed raw, natural gas liquids (NGL), also called condensate, are stored in tanks until there is a sufficient volume to be pumped into either a tank truck for transportation or pumped into a liquids pipeline.\n\nAfter compression, the gas is subjected to a liquid desiccant, Triethylene glycol (TEG), to further remove water.  The glycol is regenerated and used again.\n\nThe Station?s maximum intended inventory of flammable substances in a mixture is larger than the threshold quantity (10,000 lbs.) of regulated flammable substances.  Therefore, the Station is subject to the EPA RMP Standard.\n\nHistory and Ownership\n\nThe Frederick Compressor Station was built by Panhandle Eastern Co in the early 1980's.  The compressor station was sold to Kinder Morgan Inc., formerly known as KN Energy, in 1993 and who maintained operations through December 1, 1999.  In 1999 HS Resources bought the station and operated it until 2001. In August, 2001 Kerr Mc"

      "SummaryText": "Gee (KMG) acquired HS Resources and continued operations until APC acquired Kerr McGee in 2006.\n\nProgram Level\n\nAPC has determined that Program Level 3 applies to the Frederick Compressor Station.  The Off Site Consequence Analysis reveals that there is a \"public receptor\" within 0.3 mile of the calculated endpoint for the worst-case scenario.\n\nAlternative Release Scenario (ARS)\n\nThe ARS used in the calculations shown in the RMP was determined using the following criteria.\nThe ARS was for a release of flammable liquids resulting in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE). The release considered to have lasted 10 minutes, resulting in a release of 26,000lbs of material. Using the RMP Comp software, the maximum distance to the 1.0 pounds per square inch endpoint for this release was calculated to be 0.09 miles. This event was selected as being a possible scenario for use in out emergency response and planning programs.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThe Station has established and maintains an emergency response plan that is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect employees and the general public from the hazardous effects of releases and to minimize the effects of any releases. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect station, personnel, and regulatory changes"
