      "SummaryText": "Continental Aluminum has developed the attached Risk Management Plan and is forwarding it to the E.P.A.  on June 21,1999.  This plan differs from the Process Safety Management Program as the program is the system that backs up the plan and ensures that our plant is being operated in a safe manner.\n\nThe elements of our program follows the OSHA Process Safety Management written program to ensure that we have zero releases and zero spills.  Our goal for our plant in New Hudson is zero releases and zero spills.\n\nWe will achieve this goal by training and re-training our employees involved in the Chlorine Process.  We have written Safe Operating Procedures for all aspects of the Chlorine System, and perform Chlorine Safety Audits of our P.S.M. program every six months.  In this way Continental Aluminum will continue to mitigate the risks associated with chlorine.\n\n\n\n\nBruce Bergeson\nV.P.  of  Operations"
