The facility provides storage of potable water received from the Second San Diego Aqueduct operated by the San Diego County Water Authority.  Chlorine will be used at the station to disinfect water intended for distribution to the domestic water supply system. The station will be unmanned and is equipped with chlorine release detection equipment, automated alarm and auto-dialing equipment and scrubber system.\nA leak monitoring device will notify VWD personnel in the event of a chlorine leak.\n\nCHEMICALS SUBJECT TO EPA?S ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nVWD will use and store chlorine in quantities large enough to trigger the Accidental Release Prevention Program:\nTypically, two 1-ton chlorine cylinders will be in use, and up to eight 1-ton cylinders can be stored at the station. Chlorine will be imported to the pump station via truck, stored onsite in a one-ton container, and used for disinfection operations.\n\nPROCESS SAFETY MANAGEMENT ACCIDENT PREVENTION PROGRAM:\n\nThe Twin Oaks Reservoir Facility is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations for all equipment and operations associated with its chlorine system. VWD's PSM programs include the following to minimize the potential for an accidental release:\n - Review of the design of all equipment and controls for the chlorine system to ensure they are properly designed and installed.\n - Update standard operating procedures to include specific information on safety procedures. All procedures must be reviewed and certified annually.\n - Initial safety training and 3-year refresher training for all operators and maintenance staff.\n - Procedures to ensure that all contractors receive the same safety training that VWD provides for its own employees.\n - Regular inspection of all equipment, monitoring systems and controls, including documentation of all i"

      "SummaryText": "nspections.\n - Prompt corrective action for any non-conforming items identified by the regular inspections.\n - Safety reviews conducted prior to system startup, if any equipment or operations are modified.\n - Investigation of any incidents that have the potential to have caused chlorine releases.\n - Periodic evaluation of the safety records of all outside contractors who work on the RMP-regulated system.\n - Development of an effective emergency response program.\n - Implementation of an employee participation program to ensure that all plant-wide staff are aware of the PSM/RMP program, and are actively consulted regarding safety issues.\n - Independent audits of the entire PSM/RMP program every three years.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY:\n\nAt this facility, there has not had any releases during the past five years that resulted in any injuries, off-site evacuations, or property damage.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES:\n\nVWD uses its First Response Chlorine Procedure Guide to provide step-by-step procedures for emergency response in the unlikely event of an accidental release. The key elements of the emergency preparedness program are as follows:\n - All plant staff (including administrative and clerical staff) is trained in the specific elements of the program.\n - A team of engineers, supervisors and operators are trained, certified and equipped for hazardous materials (Hazmat) emergency operations to repair accidental releases.\n - In the event of a large chlorine release, the facility would automatically contact a telephone call-down list that includes the San Marcos Fire Department, the San Diego County LEPC, and several nearby commercial establishments that could be affected if the wind was blowing toward them during the release.\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY:\n\nImprove security based on findings from the vulnerability assessment."
