We work with the Bradley County Fire and Rescue Department to conduct facility familiarization tours for firefighters, support required facility inspections and conduct joint training exercises.\n\nProfessional technicians test our fire protection system on a monthly basis, including signals, alarms and sprinkler protection of specified processing areas. Similarly, service technicians perform monthly inspections and service on our respiratory protection equipment, and annual inspections on all fire extinguishers.  Facility personnel test our fire pumps, safety showers and eyewash stations on a weekly basis. Facility personnel also conduct regular testing of the uninterruptable power supply and emergency power generators, which will allow the facility to operate in a limited capacity to maintain process safety in the event of a major electrical power interruption from our supplier. \n\nSite personnel who are members of the Fire Department participate in frequent training and drills.  They also receive training on emergency response procedures and the proper use of protective and response equipment. The Fire Department will maintain both the chemical protective clothing and response equipment.\n\nF) PLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\nWacker Charleston continually seeks to improve its processes through advancements in technology and automation. We are continually working to ensure the safety of our site, our team members, our community, and our environment."

This incident did not result in a release of a regulated substance that met or exceeded a reportable quantity.\n\nE) THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nWACKER staffs a full-time professional Fire Department using highly trained Fire Fighters to respond to all emergencies that may occur at the WACKER site. The Fire Department employs site Emergency Action Plans when responding to any type of site emergency.

      "SummaryText": "A) THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES AT THE STATIONARY SOURCE \nWacker is committed to the Safety, Health and Security of our team members, contractors, visitors and customers, and to our neighboring community. WACKER Charleston continually strives to meet or exceed all applicable Environmental, Health, Safety and Security laws, regulations and other requirements in all of its operations at all of its facilities. At the WACKER Charleston, TN site, we seek to prevent accidental releases of hazardous substances through a combination of robustly engineered equipment, use of proven, highly reliable chemical processes and advanced technology that minimizes reliance on human responses.\n\nWACKER's approach also involves extensive training of our chemical operations team members in the many detailed operating procedures that have been developed. We inspect our facility thoroughly on a frequent and regular basis to ensure that any issues that are found are addressed before they become significant concerns.\n\nWACKER's commitment to protecting people and the environment extends to its approach to\nemergency preparedness and response. To ensure that the effects of any releases that do occur\nare minimized, Wacker has established a full-time, fully trained professional fire department and\nemergency response team equipped with state-of-the-art response equipment.\n\nB) THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES HANDLED\nThe Wacker Charleston Site is a chemical manufacturing facility that produces hyper-pure crystalline polysilicon for the solar energy and semi-conductor industries. The site operates on a continuous basis, seven days per week. The highly integrated and interconnected process is divided into production units with specific functions that operate independently.\nThe RMP regulated substances on the site are hydrogen chloride, trichlorosilane, and dichlorosilane.  It should be noted that Wacker does receive Chlorine via pipeline; however, t"
