High pressure gas from field wells is sent to a gas plant whereby NGL liquids are extracted and stored in one 12,000 gallon pressurized bullet tank operating at approximately 50 psig.  The NGL is removed from the facility by transfers to tank trucks.\n\n\n\nThe NGL is a mixture of hydrocarbons consisting of methane, ethane, butane, isobutane, propane and pentane. For purposes of determining the largest weight on site, the highest density substance was used butane).\n\n\n\nSince this facility is a Program 1, a written prevention plan is not required.  Emergency response procedures have been developed and are contained at the front of the RMP and these procedures will be implemented in the event of an accidental release or the threat of such a release.\n\n\n\nThe facility has not experienced an accident as defined in the regulation within the past five years.\n\n\n\nAt present time, there are no planned changes to improve safety.
