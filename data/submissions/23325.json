Facility Policy.\n\n     The owner, management, and employees of Golden Furrow Fertilizer are committed to the prevention\n     of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is\n     prepared to work with the local fire department to mitigate and minimize the impacts of the release.\n\n2.  Facility Information.\n\n     The primary activity at the facility is the storage fertilizers for sale to farmers. Anhydrous ammonia is\n     received, stored and distributed for direct application as a nutrient for crop production. The maximun\n     quantity stored would be 521,000 lbs in storage tanks and nurse tanks.\n\n3.  Worse-Case Scenario and Alternate Release Scenario.\n\n     The worse-case scenario would be the release of total contents of a storage tank released as gas over\n     a period of 10 min. The maximum quantity released would be 76,500 lbs. The distance to the end 2.1 mile\n     The alternate release scenario a 1-inch hose is used as an alternate release followed by release of\n     ammonia for 2 min. The maximum quantity released would be 26,600 lbs. The distance to the endpoint\n     is 1.6 miles.\n\n4.  Accidental Release Prevention Program.\n\n    The facililty is in compliance with the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for Storage and Handling of\n    Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\" published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc. and the\n    standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR 1910.11, \"Storage and\n    Handling of anhydrous ammonia.\n\n5.  Five-Year Accident History.\n\n    There have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that have caused\n    any deaths, injuries or significant property damage at the facility, nor to our knowledge, has there been\n    any accidental releases resulted on off-site deaths, injuries, evacuations, property damage, or \n    environmental"
