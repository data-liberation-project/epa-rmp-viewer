Introduction\n\n\n\nThe McKinleyville Community Services District (MCSD, the District) utilizes chlorine and sulfur dioxide to provide disinfection of treated wastewater at their Wastewater Management Facility (WWMF) located off of Hiller Road in McKinleyville, CA. Liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide is stored separately on-site in one-ton containers. The District, at maximum, stores 6000lbs of liquid chlorine and 4000lbs of sulfur dioxide.\n\n\n\nChlorine and sulfur dioxide are listed by state and federal agencies as a regulated substance.  The federal Accidental Release Prevention program requires stationary sources with more than the threshold quantity of a regulated substance to be evaluated to determine the potential for and impacts of accidental releases from the covered process.  Under conditions specified by the state and federal agencies, the owner or operator of a stationary source which stores more than the threshold quantity is required to develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP).  \n\n\n\nThe federal threshold quantity for chlorine is 2,500 lbs. and the state threshold for sulfur dioxide is 500lbs., therefore requires the District to develop and submit a RMP to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  In addition, the District will be subject to the provisions of the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) program.  The CalARP program includes the federal Accidental Release Prevention Program with certain additions specific to the state pursuant to the state Health and Safety Code.  The purpose of the state and federal accidental release programs is to prevent the accidental release of regulated substances.\n\n\n\nB.    Accidental Release Prevention\n\n\n\nThe District recognizes the potential impact of handling chlorine and sulfur dioxide in conjunction with their wastewater treatment processes.  The District has implemented several safety programs and procedures to prevent accidental releases.  These plans have been upda"

Process Management Safety Plan\n\n\n\nThe California Division of Occupational Safety (Cal/OSHA) requires that owners/operators of facilities upon which any listed acutely hazardous material is stored/used in excess of specified quantities must develop a Process Safety Management (PSM) plan.  The goal of the regulation is to reduce the risk of occupationally related injuries of illnesses related to the accidental release of an acutely hazardous material.  The District's PSM plan was originally developed in 1999 and has been updated regularly to reflect changes in management and emergency response procedures. This document identifies the physical and toxicological hazards of chlorine and sulfur dioxide, and analyzes the hazards inherent in the District's processes regarding these substances. The process hazard analysis utilized a composite of several different methodologies, including what-if, failure mode effects analysis, and primary hazard assessment.  The objectives of the analysis were to identify possible hazard scenarios, identify what causes(s) could lead to each scenario, characterize the probable consequence of each cause and suggest corresponding mitigation options.\n\n\n\nOnce the possible hazard scenarios were characterized, a qualitative estimation of the frequency with which causative factors might occur and a categorization of the consequences based upon degree of severity upon employee health and safety was developed.  Finally a risk ranking was derived from a matrix composed of axes representing frequency and consequence.\n\n\n\nThe District's PSM plan forms the backbone of the Risk Management Plan. Additional elements required by the Risk Management Plan Program were added, most notably the analysis and evaluation of potential off-site consequences.  The PSM plan was re-evaluated with respect to new and additional information gathered d"

Hazardous Material Handling Training\n\n\n\nEach employee presently operating or maintaining a process, and each employee before working a newly assigned process, shall be trained in the process, associated hazards, applicable safe work practices, and operating procedures. It is the responsibility of the District Manager and Operations Director to ensure that this training is accomplished and documented. This training should be a combination of classroom and hands-on instruction.\n\n\n\nAll District field personnel have completed 40 hour HAZWOPER initial-responder training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response training. Refresher training per the Hazardous Waste Operations & Emergency Response standard (Cal/OSHA 8- 5192) shall be provided on an annual basis to those employees who would be expected to respond to a release or threatened release of a hazardous material. \n\n\n\nE.    Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nThe District's Emergency Response Policies are clearly outlined in the McKinleyville Community Services District Wastewater Management Facility Emergency Response Program (Appendix A). The Emergency Response Program is intended as a guide of emergency response procedures in the event of hazardous material release/spill. This document is also intended as a reference source to familiarize local emergency response agencies, fire, police and local hospitals on operations relating to hazardous materials and the emergency response at the WWMF. \n\n\n\n\n\nF.    Potential Off-Site Consequences\n\n\n\n1.    Worst-Case Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe worst-case scenario is dictated by EPA as being the release of the entire contents of the largest on-site container (one ton) in 10 minutes.   Although extremely unlikely to ever occur, air dispersion modeling of the worst case scenario has determined that effectively, the entire community of McKinleyville would be included within the defined endpoints of"

The estimated population impacted by this release scenario is approximately 16,900 people, and includes; schools, residences, recreation areas, commercial and office areas, state parks, wildlife preserves, local parks and trails, and child day-care facilities. \n\n\n\nThe consulting firm of Scientech, Inc. of Idaho Falls, Idaho was retained to prepare computer modeling and mapping of the endpoints for the District's Risk Management Plan.  The endpoints that are required to be mapped for the Risk Management Plan are defined as \"the maximum\" airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all individuals could be exposed for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair an individual 's ability to take protective action\".  This concentration is defined as 3 parts per million (ppm).\n\n\n\nThe physical limits which define the endpoints (3 ppm concentration) of each release scenario were determined based upon computer modeling of several factors. These factors include the amount and rate of material assumed to be released (the release scenario), and also weather conditions; typically represented by wind direction, velocity and atmospheric stability.  The air dispersion modeling computer program utilized by the District's consultant examines historic weather data for the McKinleyville airport and uses the conditions which would produce the worst dispersion of the chlorine to calculate the concentration of chlorine based upon the selected release scenario. It then plots contour lines of equal concentrations, and from this plot, we can identify the location of the endpoint (3 ppm) concentration.\n\n\n\nIt is important to recognize that the plotted endpoints are not consistent with our intuitive concept of air dispersion \"plumes\" or clouds. A plume represents the dispersion of material given one particular set of atmospheric conditions (primarily wind direction a"

The air dispersion model utilized in the Risk Management Plan plots the endpoints for dispersion by wind in all directions, based upon the worst historic atmospheric conditions for each direction. It is informative to review the historic wind and atmospheric data upon which the Risk Management Plan is based. Examining the worst atmospheric conditions (F Stability) upon which the air dispersion modeling is based, the historic information shows that a total of 86% of the time during the F Stability conditions, the plume would move away from the Wastewater Management Facility between the quadrants of NNW and SW. There are no residential receptors within these quadrants. Likewise, the historical information can be reviewed for wind direction and frequency for ALL wind speeds, directions and atmospheric conditions. This information shows that for the historic information, over 48% of the time the plume would move away from any residential receptors.\n\n\n\n2.    Alternate-Release Scenario\n\n\n\nThe Alternate Release Scenario is intended to represent a more credible, but still highly unlikely accidental release scenario.  The Risk Management Plan Program allows greater latitude in selecting an alternate release scenario that reasonably represents the actual details of the facility.  Staff and consultants have reviewed the Process Safety Management Plan and considered actual materials handling procedures at the Waste Water Management Facility.  Based upon this review, the most credible alternate release scenario is thought to be a discharge from the connection port on the one-ton cylinder.  This accidental release is most likely to occur during the handling of the cylinder during delivery and connection/disconnection, and we have therefore assumed that District personnel are present when the incident occurs.\n\n\n\nActual hands-on exercises where District employees practice their hazardous materials training demonstrate that it is reasonable to assume a repair kit can be appl"

A 90-minute discharge through the cylinder's connection port (a 5/16\" diameter hole) therefore defines the selected alternate release scenario. This scenario results in a total of 635lbs of chlorine being released within the 90-minute duration.\n\n\n\nThe 3 ppm endpoints for this release scenario have been plotted and mapped, and it is estimated that the estimated population affected by this release scenario is approximately 2,050 people, and includes; residences, recreation areas, local parks and trails, and child day-care facilities. \n\n\n\nG.    Administrative Controls and Mitigations\n\n\n\nIn conjunction with the Disinfection Alternatives Report prepared by Oscar Larson and Associates (Appendix D), the District considered adopting administrative controls to limit the inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to avoid requirements for filing the Federal RMP.  District staff believes these controls offer little or no real potential to reduce the risk or potential off-site consequences of an accidental release.  Other administrative controls have already been implemented that minimize the on-site quantities of hazardous materials within reasonable parameters of materials delivery schedules and assurance that the District remains able to provide needed disinfection functions at their critical facilities.\n\n\n\nThe District has elected to implement several mitigations of risk and the potential off-site consequences of an accidental release. In addition, the District continues to invest in training, preparation, organization, and coordination with other responding agencies.  The training of staff to respect the inherent risk in handling hazardous material is likely the best investment to reduce the risk of accidental release, as the human factor is often a large contributing factor in accidents.  Likewise, the preparation, training, and organization necessary to provide efficient and effective response in the event of an accidental"

Accidental Release - Accident History\n\n\n\nThe District has utilized chlorine and sulfur dioxide since the Waste Water Management Facility was constructed in 1983. In over 32 years of handling chlorine, the District has never experienced an accidental release. The District remains committed to maintaining this excellent accident history, and never experiencing an accidental release in the future.  In recognition of this commitment, the District continues regular training of field personnel in the safe handling, and proper emergency response in the event of an accidental release.  Safety meetings are conducted on a regular basis, and topics discussed and staff members attending are documented in District files.  Various safety plans including the District's Hazardous Material Business Plan, the Process Safety Management Plan, and the District's Emergency Operations Plan are regularly reviewed and updated.  The District has contracted with the Northern California Safety Consortium to conduct training sessions and functional exercises in the implementation of these various plans.\n\n\n\nI.    Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nThe MCSD Wastewater Management Facility Emergency Response Program (ERP) includes the chemical-specific emergency response procedures for releases of chlorine, sulfur dioxide; and other extremely hazardous substances. The program identifies responsibilities of District personnel; coordination with outside agencies and emergency responders; hazardous material locations; engineering controls (e.g. alarms); the required personal protective equipment (PPE); and required emergency equipment.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Response Plan is a section of the Emergency Response Program that outlines specific procedures for reducing the risk/impact of a release and emergency response procedures in the event of a hazardous gas, liquid, or solid release/spill at the WWMF.

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\n\n\nThe District retained the engineering consulting firm of Oscar Larson and Associates to prepare a Disinfection Alternatives Study.  The purpose of the Oscar Larson and Associates study was to examine the existing practices and procedures as well as alternate disinfection methodologies to evaluate revisions to the District's current practices and procedures that might reduce the risk of accidental release and/or potential off-site consequences in the event of an accidental release.  Four alternatives, in addition to the existing conditions, were identified and evaluated in the final report. Cost estimates were prepared for both capital costs and maintenance costs of each alternative.\n\n\n\nThe final report prepared by Oscar Larson and Associates recommended the District continue the current practices utilizing liquid chlorine and sulfur dioxide, or adopt administrative controls to limit the inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide to avoid requirements for filing the Federal RMP.  District staff feels the administrative controls to limit the inventory of chlorine and sulfur dioxide below the federal regulatory threshold limits to avoid the requirement to file the Federal RMP, offers little or no real potential to reduce the risk or potential off-site consequences of an accidental release.\n\n\n\nThe final report also recommended installation of a number of safety upgrades to further improve the safety of the existing facilities, and/or improve the District's ability to respond in the event of an accidental release. The District has approved and implemented all recommended improvements.\n\n\n\nImprovements implemented include:  \n\n?    Emergency Exhaust Fan Ducts\n\n?    Additional Leak Detectors\n\n?
