      "SummaryText": "A Risk Management Plan (RMP) has been prepared in accordance with Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 68 (40 CFR 68) for the Visual Pak Pleasant Prairie, Inc. (Visual Pak) facility for the prevention of accidental releases of subject regulated substances. The facility is located at 9605 136th Avenue in Kenosha, Wisconsin (Kenosha County), and is a storage and distribution warehouse that manages various consumer products that are manufactured by S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (SCJ). SCJ is a privately held, family-managed company, with worldwide headquarters located in Racine, Wisconsin. The facility was constructed on a greenfield site in 2021\r\nand started to receive products in August 2021.\r\n\r\nPropellants comprised of flammable mixtures subject to the above-cited federal regulation are in select aerosol-based consumer products stored and managed in association with the Visual Pak facility. Consumer products are stored inside the warehouse - for which Level 2 & 3 aerosols are stored in a designated aerosol room, while Level 1 aerosols may be stored throughout the warehouse. \r\n\r\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) propellant used in select aerosol products contains several components that are classified as flammable materials under federal RMP regulations.  Specifically, the propellants consist of blends of propane (CAS No. 74-98-6), butane (CAS No. 106-97-8) and isobutane (CAS No. 75-28-5). These are collectively regulated as a flammable mixture.  The maximum projected quantities of aerosol products stored at the facility and product propellant weights were used to estimate maximum quantities of RMP-regulated chemicals in the warehouse storage & handling processes. Although the size of each individual aerosol container is relatively small (typically 15 to 17.5 ounce cans), the number of such containers present onsite at any given time has the potential to exceed the corresponding 10,000 pound TQ. The flammable mixture mass reported in Sec. 1.17.c (10,486,750"
