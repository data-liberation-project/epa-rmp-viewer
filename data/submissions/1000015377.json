      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAccidental Release Prevention And Emergency Response Policies \n\nAt the Martin Underground Storage, Inc. facility, we handle substances considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling these substances to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and State rules and regulations.  Safety depends on the manner in which we handle these substances, the safety devices inherent in the design of the facility, the safe handling procedures that we use, and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Underground Storage, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Arcadia Fire Department, and other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\nThe General Accidental Release Prevention Program And The Specific Prevention Steps\n\nMartin Underground Storage, Inc. complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rules, EPA's Chemical Accident Prevention Risk Management Plan (RMP) rules, and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR 68.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the"

The entire contents of the tank are assumed to release as a vapor cloud, which finds an ignintion source.  Ten percent of the released quantity is assumed to participate in the resulting explosion. Martin Underground Storage, Inc. has underground wells that were not considered for the worst case and alternative relese scenarios; however, the piping to these wells is.  \n\nThe worst-case release scenario would result in a release of the largest vessel as well as the associated piping.  To evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized the EPA recommended software call RMP*Comp.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur is the failure of a flexible transfer hose while transferring iso-butane from a truck transport to a temporary storage tank.  The flexible hose has a nominal diameter of 2-inches.  Excess flow valves at the truck transport function to stop the flow of the chemical out of the truck transport.  RMP*Comp was used to calculate the release rate through a 2-inch opening in pounds/minute.  Each scenario was modeled using a release of 10% of the tank at a duration of 10 minutes.  RMP*Comp calculated the distance to endpoints for the release of each.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nMartin Underground Storage, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, and equipment designs associated with the processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur personnel conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that the hazards associated with our  processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a \"What if\" checklist.  The studies ar"

Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our processes, Martin Underground Storage, Inc. maintains written operation procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes\n\nTraining\n\nMartin Underground Storage, Inc. has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the processes. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nOur personnel carry out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Martin Underground Storage, Inc. to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.  Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted as a regular practice at Martin Underground Storage, Inc.

These audits are carried out at least every three years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nMartin Underground Storage, Inc. promptly investigates any incident that resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of our hazardous substances.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring.  All investigation reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nIt is our belief at Martin Underground Storage, Inc., that process safety management and accident prevention are a team effort.  Our company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements.\n\nContractors\n\nOccasionally, Martin Underground Storage, Inc. hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance or construction activities.  We have a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor\u00c3\u00bf\u00c2\u00bfs work and the processes.
