      "SummaryText": "Facility Description\r\n\r\nEnviroTech operates two processes in its Helena, Arkansas facility that are subject to the requirements of both the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Management Plan (RMP) rule (40 CFR 68) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management standards (29 CFR 1910.119).  The first process, BromMax, uses bromine and chlorine as raw materials in the manufacture of stabilized bromine salts.  In this process, bromine is received in bulk and stored in two 1,000 gallon storage tanks prior to use in the process.  Chlorine is received, stored, and used from one ton cylinders.  Up to two cylinders may be connected to the process at any one time.  The bromine and chlorine are then used in a reactor vessel to make the final product.  The covered process includes the storage and handling of the bromine and chlorine up through the reactor vessel.\r\n\r\nThe second process involves the manufacture of another RMP listed chemical, peracetic acid.  The ingredients for the peracetic acid are combined in mixing vessels and the peracetic acid product is actually formed in the storage containers during a seven day curing period.  The process where material with more than 1% peracetic acid exists is limited to the shipping containers which are stored and handled inside a warehouse.  The final product concentration of peracetic acid ranges from 5% to 25%, depending on the specific product.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental, Health, and Safety Policy\r\n\r\nEnviroTech's commitment to providing a safe, healthy work environment for employees as well as providing a safe, healthy environment for the surrounding community is the primary goal of EnviroTech's management. The properties of bromine, chlorine, peracetic acid, and other hazardous chemicals on site make it necessary to observe certain safety precautions to prevent human exposures to hazardous concentrations, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the thre"

EnviroTech management and employees are committed to compliance with all regulations that are applicable to the facility, including those under the RMP and PSM rules.\r\n\r\nAccidental Release Prevention Program Overview\r\n\r\nThe Helena facility complies with the Program 3 requirements of the RMP programs through the implementation of a program for process safety intended to prevent accidental releases of hazardous chemicals. This is a comprehensive program with elements that include development of process safety information appropriate to the process, process hazard analysis, employee training, operating procedures, mechanical integrity, management of change, pre-startup safety reviews, contractor safety, emergency planning and response, compliance auditing, safe work procedures, and employee participation.\r\n\r\nThe program ensures that the process and the equipment in the process is designed, constructed, operated, and maintained according to industry codes and standards and accepted good engineering practices.  Process hazards analyses have been conducted on both processes to identify and characterize potential hazards in the processes and to develop control measures for the identified hazards.  Operating procedures have been prepared and training has been conducted for all affected employees.  A management of change process is used to insure that no hazards are introduced through any changes in chemicals, equipment, procedures or the operation of the processes. The mechanical integrity element of the program includes identification of critical equipment and scheduled inspections and tests of that equipment including storage and containment features as well as monitoring and control devices in the process to detect any deficiencies or defects in equipment.  Preventative maintenance and replacement policies for parts and equipment ensure that deficiencies are addressed and corrected before they could potentially contribute to a rele"

All elements of the Process Safety Management Program help to minimize the risk of an uncontrolled release of hazardous chemicals.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program Overview\r\n\r\nEnviroTech has developed an emergency response plan (in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules at 29 CFR 1910.38 and 29 CFR 1910.120) that includes provisions to respond to chemical emergencies on-site with trained EnviroTech personnel and provisions to evacuate personnel from the facility in the event of an uncontrolled accidental release of a hazardous chemical. The emergency response program focuses on the following key elements: discovery and notification of a release or other incident, facility evacuation and head count procedures, mobilization of the appropriate response effort, coordination with local response agencies and authorities, identification of trained responders and incident commanders, post-incident recovery and clean-up procedures, media relations, and the conduct of training, drills and response critiques.  In addition to chemical releases the emergency response plan also addresses medical emergencies, fires and explosions, severe weather events, seismic events, and security events such as bomb threats, suspicious mail, unauthorized personnel on site, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is EnviroTech's policy to contact the local emergency response agencies, including the local fire department in the event of a hazardous chemical release. EnviroTech has coordinated with the local emergency planning committee on its emergency response plan, and in the unlikely event of an uncontrolled release, the local authorities will be notified by EnviroTech and a joint decision will be made on whether local areas will be evacuated. The local authorities will notify any affected neighbors or surrounding properties if an evacuation is necessary.\r\n\r\nFive Year Accident History\r\n\r\nThe only incident involving any sort of release of the listed chemicals in use was a very"

      "SummaryText": "small splash of peracetic acid. This release occurred in June 2015 during pre-production activities before work began on the peracetic acid production facility. At that time, some repackaging of peracetic acid products that were produced at another location was being done. During the repackaging process, an operator was splashed with a few drops of peracetic acid product that got under his protective equipment.  The splash resulted in a small second-degree burn which met the criteria for OSHA recordability and therefore is included in this submittal. This release was not reportable under environmental requirements.  \r\n\r\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\r\n\r\nEnviroTech is committed to continuous efforts to improve the safe operation of the BromMax and peracetic acid processes by implementing preventative maintenance programs, inspection programs, and employee training in the safe operation of the equipment and the system. The processes are designed in accordance with good engineering practices.  The management of change process is used to evaluate any system changes or modifications to insure continued compliance with regulatory requirements and good engineering practices and identify any needed safety precautions prior to implementation of the changes.  In addition, periodic auditing of the prevention program is conducted to identify any needed improvements to procedures, systems or equipment."
