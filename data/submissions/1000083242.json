The facility has a gross\n\noutput of 723.3 MW, with a net output of 665 MW. The boiler utilizes Low NOx burners and overfire air in\n\nconjunction with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) module for NOx control. Anhydrous Ammonia, as a\n\nvapor is injected into the SCR module for conversion of the NOx emissions into nitrogen and water.\n\n \n\nAdditional emission control equipment associated with the pulverized coal-fired boiler include baghouse for\n\nparticulate control, activated carbon injection for mercury control, and a Spray Dryer Absorber / Dry Flue Gas\n\nDesulfurization unit for SO2 control. The Spray Dryer Absorber operation utilizes calcium hydroxide for SO2\n\nremoval.\n\n \n\nThe facility also operates a 285 MMBtu/hr #2 fuel oil fired Auxiliary Boiler used to assist with startup of the\n\ncoal-fired boiler and emergency operations. The Auxiliary Boiler is limited to 500 hours of operations per\n\nyears."
