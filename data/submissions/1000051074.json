The EHS Manager has been assigned to ensure that safe practices are followed in the specification and operation of systems involving hazardous chemicals. The site has specific and written evacuation, reporting, and response procedures in place to protect Alta Devices employees, the public, and the environment in the event of a release.\n\n\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Alta Devices facility is located in the City of Sunnyvale in Santa Clara County, California. It is bounded by Oakmead Parkway to the east, and adjacent commercial and industrial properties to the north, south, and west. The Facility operates between 6:30 AM and 12:00 AM, seven days a week. The facility is surrounded by commercial buildings that contain potential offsite industrial public receptors. The facility began operations in October 2011. Figure 1 of the RMP document shows the site map and Figure 2 of the RMP document shows the facility location. Typical operations at the facility include activities related to the research and development of solar cells and the manufacturing solar cells. Production of the solar cells takes place in the Production Area of Sections B and C. Section A is currently used as office and meeting space. Highly hazardous materials are stored in the H2 occupancy of Section C and in a series of chemical bunkers outside the western side of Section C and bunkers next to the facilities pad. Table 1 documents the maximum intended inventories for the Alta Devices site. The North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for Alta Devices is: 334413 - Semiconductor and Related Device Manufacturing. The Standard Industrial Code (SIC) "

The worst-case release scenario was identified as that which was estimated to create the greatest distance in any direction to the toxic endpoint. The worst-case release quantity was defined as the total quantity of in the largest container to rupture for arsine. The alternative release scenarios considered both the five-year accident history and the results of the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) study conducted on July 6, 2015. The alternative-case release scenario was identified for arsine as a 400 foot 1/4\" line @ 45 PSIG breaking, releasing all contents into a room or exterior.\n\n\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nPrevention of accidental releases at Alta Devices is accomplished through sound industry practice for toxic gases and liquids and the MOCVD tool system design and construction, the specification and review of system modifications, and the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the system.\n\nThis includes:\n\n? Compliance with industry standards and codes in effect at the time of initial construction and modification;\n\n? California Building Code 2010 & 2013; California Fire Code 2007; 2009 Sunnyvale Municipal Code - Examples included the following:\n\n? Restrictive flow orifices on all toxic gas cylinders.\n\n? All connections/valves are contained within exhausted enclosures and lines (connections) are welded. Arsine lines are double contained.\n\n? Exhaust ventilation and treatment systems have emergency back-up power\n\n? Exhausted enclosures are vented to a dilution fan or dry/wet treatment system that will maintain release from within enclosures to < ? IDLH.\n\n? Gas detection system and seismic sensor automatically closes safety valves on the arsine and the control valves are fail closed valves.\n\n? Perfor"

Implementation of Operating Procedures which have been reviewed by PHA;\n\n? Appropriate initial and refresher training of system operations and maintenance personnel;\n\n? Performance of preventive and corrective maintenance according to system component manufacturer recommendations and pursuant to site wide hazardous energy lockout and hot work permit programs;\n\n? Application of established auditing, inspection, and pre-start-up review protocols; and\n\n? Use of qualified contractors for work on the system.\n\n\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThere has been no arsine, phosphine, chlorine, or hydrofluoric acid releases resulting in onsite or off-site injuries, deaths, or property damage, or in off-site environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nAlta Devices has well-established emergency procedures and an active Emergency Response Team (ERT) on site to ensure rapid and appropriate response to hazardous material emergencies, including response to emergencies related to the regulated substances covered by this RMP. The emergency response procedures are contained in the Emergency Response Plan, accessible at the site and maintained by the EHS Manager. The document describes response procedures for various emergency scenarios, including the mitigation of hazardous material releases, agency notification procedures in the event of a hazardous material release, and emergency equipment available at the site.\n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nBased on the studies conducted during preparation of this RMP, the following adjustments are planned to ensure continued safe operations:\n\n? The facility will perform an additional PHA after the finalization of design to ensure that all safety requirements detailed in the July 6, 2015 PHA have been implemented."
