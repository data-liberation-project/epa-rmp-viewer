      "SummaryText": "Sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide are stored and used onsite by Intertrade at the Copperhill, TN facility in quantities that exceed the threshold quantities as defined by the Risk Management Program regulations. Intertrade has diligently developed and implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Program, assessing the hazards associated with the process, as well as implementing procedures which minimize the probability and severity of a release.\n\nIn the past five years there have been no releases. Furthermore, the facility complies with the EPA's accident prevention rule and all appliciable state and local codes and regulations.\n\nOur worst-case scenario is the unlikely failure of the sulfur dioxide pressure vessel during a time in which the maximum quanity is stored in it. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint. Our alternative release scenarios are piping breaks and small vessel leaks. The resulting endpoint distances extend offsite, and public receptors are within the endpoint distances.\n\nIn the event of an emergency involving the release of sulfur dioxide or sulfur trioxide in amounts greater than the minimum reported quantities, it is our policy to notify the Polk County LEPC and TEMA. Due to the close proximity of the site location to the state borders of Georgia and North Carolina, TEMA and the Polk County LEPC may advise Intertrade to notify the North Carolina or Georgia LEPC."
