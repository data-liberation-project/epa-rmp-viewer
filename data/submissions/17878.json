If a   facility is prepared to work with the local fire department or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\nFACILITY INFORMATION  \nThe DeLong Co. is a member of the Fertilizer 100.  Meaning they are one of the largest 100 fertilizer dealers in the nation and one of the biggest in Wisconsin. They employ more than 85 company wide.  There are actually 5  divisions in The DeLong Co. Inc. Chick DeLong is in charge of feed. Bo DeLong is in charge of grain. Dan DeLong is in charge of DeLco Transport. Steve Quade is in charge of the seed division. David DeLong, President, is in charge of\nfertilizer and chemicals. The primary activity at the facility is the storage, distribution and application of anhydrous ammonia for stateline area farmers. The maximum quantity stored would be the unloading of a  tank car holding 150,000 lbs.\n\nWORST-CASE\n\nThe worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank or tank car released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released  would be 150,000 pounds which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85 per cent of capacity as  limited by design standards.  The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 1.1 miles.\n\nALTERNATIVE-CASE\n\nThe alternative release scenario is based on the five-year accident history or the most likely potential incident is  release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.41 miles.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements\" for the storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia K-6 1.1 published by the American National Standards institute Inc. and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1"

Periodic evaluations are performed to access the maintenance and safety conditions. There are no additional specific anhydrous ammonia safety recommendations for implementation at this time."
