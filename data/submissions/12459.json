      "SummaryText": "The A.T. Wall Company Risk Management Plan outlines an accidental release prevention policy that involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures and management practices.   The A.T. Wall company emergency response policy involves the preparation of response plans based on the emergency response services available in the community and the makeup of the facility.\n\nThe A.T. Wall Company produces high quality fabricated metal products for a variety of industries.  These include the electronics, telecommunications, aerospace and chemical industries.  The facility is located on Service Avenue in an industrial park directly off of Jefferson Boulevard, a major North South thoroughfare in a heavy commercial/industrial area with mixed residential homes.  The facility uses anhydrous ammomia in an annealing process which it stores in an 8,000 gallon water tank with maximum capacity being 87%. Various  valves, shutoffs and alarms help to safeguard against any potential release of ammonia into the surrounding community.  The facility is manned 12 hours each work day with up to 60 employees.  It is unmanned during the overnight hours and on weekends.  The maintanence manager is on site each business day and would respond to any trouble or alarms which may occur day or night.  The fire department would also respond day or night as the Incident Comander as they are notified directly if the system fails and the alarm sounds. \n\nThe worst case release scenerio at The A.T. Wall Company facility involves a failure of the 8,000 gallon water tank containing 100% anhydrous ammonia at 87% capacity  or 6,960 gallons or 35,356 pounds.  A 10 minute release based on EPA predefined conditions would extend an exposure area to a toxic endpoint of 2.3 miles downwind and approximetly 1 mile wide. An estimate of 5,000 residental population potentially affected was obtained.  It was determined that the most likely alternative release would  result in a toxic endpoint of 1/10 mile a"

      "SummaryText": "nd an estimate of population potentialyl affected is zero.\n\nThe most likely alternative release scenerio would involve the failure of some overhead piping outside of the building due to simple line failure.  The amount of ammonia released is 3,000 lbs at an average rate over 1 hour of 3,600 lbs.  The resulting toxic endpoint would be 1/10 mile. Currently there exists two active mitigation systems namely excess flow valves and emergency shutdown systems.  \n\nThe general A.T. Wall accidental release prevention program is based on the following key elements:\n\n- the training of employees\n\n-prevention maintenance program\n\n-employment of the valve and automatic shutoffs\n\n-use of accurate and effective operating procedures\n\n-performance of a hazard review of equipment and procedures\n\n-implementation of an auditing and inspection program\n\nNo accidental releases of ammonia gas has occurred at this facility in the past 5 years.\n\nThe facility has an emergency response program which has been coordinated with the City of Warwick, which is a member of the Local Emergency Response Planning Committee.  This program includes an emergency response drill and a notification plan.  Emergency response drills and drill evaluations are conducted periodically and its operation and response procedures are reviewed at that time.\n\nMany changes and updates were recommded to improve safety were identified in March 1999 when the facility was audited by University of Rhode Island employees subcontracted by the State of Rhode Island   DEM.  The final report on this audit has yet to be delivered.  All recommendations contained in that report would have been considered if received before this filing deadline."
