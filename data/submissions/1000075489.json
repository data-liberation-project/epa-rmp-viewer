Use and maintain the proper safety equipment. Such as: Gloves, Goggles, Gas Masks, Rain Suits and etc. Employees that handle NH3 are required to attend an Annual Training Meeting that is performed by an outside Professional, experienced in NH3. The Emergency Responder's numbers are displayed in a highly visible area so that customers and employees can easily spot them. Some additional safety practices include: 1) Removing keys from the ignition and unhooking the nurse tank from the vehicle before filling nurse tanks. This insures no \"drive off\" with hoses hooked to the nurse tanks. 2) We have installed Tri Pods on all load out hoses. Tri Pods are NH3 approved couplers that are designed to snap apart when someone pulls away with hoses hooked up. This eliminates structure damage, broken hoses or pipes in event that someone pulls away when the hoses are still hooked up. in the future Ever Green will increase the inspections of all nurse tanks, customer and Co-op owned to make sure they ALL meet safety requirements.\n\n\n\n",
