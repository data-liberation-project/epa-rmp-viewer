We have a strong commitment to operate our facility in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n\n\nDifluoroethane and flammable propellant blends are used at our facility as a propellant in our aerosol consumer products.  The propellant blends are contained in a closed loop system; it is designed to remain inside the piping, vessels, and filling area in our facility.  \n\n\n\n\n\nA. Describe the Accident Release Prevention and Emergency Policies\n\n\n\nChurch & Dwight Company Inc. takes many precautions to prevent or minimize accidental releases of propellant from the aerosol filling system.  These precautions include safety controls (alarms, detectors, and automatic shutdown devices) which are designed to identify and prevent potentially unsafe conditions like propellant leaks.  We also have a preventive maintenance program designed to maintain the on-going integrity of the systems, a training program designed to ensure that the systems are operated by qualified personnel, and to respond quickly to system upsets.\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Project Engineer is responsible for the management of the aerosol  safety programs.\n\n\n\nB. Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nThe facility operates an aerosol filling system with difluoroethane and propellant blends.  Difluoroethane and propellant blends are covered by the Accidental Release Prevention Regulations handled at the Lakewood plant.\n\n\n\nC. Description of the Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\n\n\nThe facility has an accident release prevention program that complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act's Process Safety Management Standard and EPA's Risk Management Program Regulation.  The prevention program consists of the following elements:\n\n\n\n- Employee Participation Program\n\n- Process Safety Information\n\n- Process Hazard Analysis\n\n- Operating Procedures\n\n- Training Program\n\n- Contractor Safety Program\n\n- Pre-Star"
