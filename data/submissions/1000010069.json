The facility is operational 24 hours a day.  Wastewater treatment operators are at the facility from 5 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, but operators are on-call to respond to any emergency situations that may arise. \n\nThe Newburyport Director of Public Services has overall responsibility for the development, implementation, and integration of the RMP elements.  The management team at the Newburyport WWTF oversees the implementation of the RMP elements in order to manage the risk of a chemical release at the facility.\n  \nHazard Assessment Program\nThe Newburyport WWTF hazard assessment program evaluates the hazards that may exist with the chlorine disinfection system, assesses the risks involved, and determines ways to reduce the probability of an accidental release of chlorine into the atmosphere.  The program also provides for determination of the impact of significant accidental releases on the public health and environment and provides a history of such releases.  In accordance with RMP requirements the hazard assessment program will be reviewed and updated at least every 5 years.\n\nEPA regulations set the reportable release quantity for chlorine at 10 pounds.  Records dating back to the 1960's indicate there has never been a reportable release from the WWTF.  However, since the potential for a release does exist wherever chlorine is stored in large quantities, an analysis of the consequences of such a release was necessary.\n\nThe Newburyport WWTF used EPA's RMP*COMP Version 1.07 software to perform the consequence analysis for both a worst-case release scenario and an alternative case release scenario.  The use of this software provides the distance to toxic endpoint, which is the distance traveled by the chlorine released before its concentration decreases to 3 parts per million.  EPA believes that nearly"

As allowed by the EPA, the results of the worst-case and alternative case release scenarios are not discussed in this Executive Summary for security purposes.\n\nPrevention Program\nThe Newburyport WWTF prevention program ensures that the elements of the risk management program are integrated and implemented on an ongoing basis, and that there is accountability and responsibility for the overall program and for each part of the program.  The prevention program addresses the following elements that are tailored to suit the degree of hazards present at the facility and the degree of complexity of the facility's operations:\n\u00c2\u00a7\tEmergency training for operators\n\u00c2\u00a7\tPreventive maintenance program\n\u00c2\u00a7\tState-of-the-art process and safety equipment\n\u00c2\u00a7\tUse of accurate and effective operating procedures, written with the participation of the operators.\n\nEmergency Response Program\nThe WWTF emergency response program addresses the actions that employees are to take in the event an accidental chlorine release occurs.  Although WWTF employees will not serve as emergency responders, they are fully responsible for determining that a chlorine release is occurring and for coordinating emergency response activities through the Newburyport Fire Department.  This program includes an emergency response decision tree and a notification plan.\n\nSafety and Mitigation Systems\nChlorine-specific safety and mitigation steps used at the WWTF include the availability of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) for evacuation purposes and for emergency repair work, chlorine safety training, and presence of chlorine leak detectors."

      "SummaryText": "Overview\nThe purpose of this document is to inform interested parties that the City of Newburyport, Massachusetts, Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) is complying with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Accidental Release Prevention regulations which require development and implementation of a Risk Management Program (RMP) under the Clean Air Act Section 112(r)(7).  This regulation is published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 68.  The Clean Air Act required EPA to develop the RMP in an effort to help prevent accidental releases of regulated substances and to reduce the severity of a release should one occur.\n\nThe City of Newburyport WWTF has one of the regulated substances, chlorine, a gas which is easily detectable by a strong irritating odor at very low concentrations and is not explosive, above the threshold quantities specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68, and therefore must comply with the RMP program.  The accidental release prevention policy at the WWTF involves a unified approach that integrates technologies, procedures, and management practices.\n\nUpgrades to WWTF\nThe City of Newburyport is in the process of modernizing and improving the processes at the WWTF that include an upgrade to the disinfection system.   The upgraded disinfection system will utilize sodium hypochlorite instead of chlorine.    Upgrades are scheduled to be implemented beginning in Spring 2010.  The City anticipates deregistering the WWTF following the disinfection upgrades as the use of sodium hypochlorite is not covered under the RMP program as it is not a regulated chemical specified in Section 68.130 of 40 CFR Part 68.    \n\nDescription of Wastewater Treatment Facility\nThe WWTF treats wastewater from most residential, commercial, and industrial establishments in the City of Newburyport.  The facility includes an operations building, a headworks building, various process tanks and structures, and a chlorination building, which c"
