Anhydrous ammonia (NH3), is a gas at ambient conditions.  The anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) refrigeration system is used to manufacture and store milk and related dairy products.  It is a closed system that contains ammonia in various physical states (gas, liquid, and saturated vapor).  The largest vessel is the high pressure receiver.  Most of the ammonia equipment is located indoors.  The condensing towers, receiver, and some piping runs are located outdoors.  The Peoria plant is located in a urban setting.\n\nAmmonia is the oldest and most common refrigerant in general industrial use throughout the world.  It is a high capacity refrigerant that operates at reasonable pressure.  Although exposure to ammonia is irritating and potentially toxic in large doses, personnel exposure to more than a small leak is rare because ammonia operates within a closed system of vessels, piping, and equipment.  In addition, ammonia can be easily detected by smell at levels well below its toxic endpoint.\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system at the Peoria plant is a single-stage system consisting of a discharge (high pressure) side and a suction side.  The reciprocating compressors draw suction from the suction accumulator (trap).  This accumulator receives suction gas from the ice water chiller, cooler units, glycol chillers, and refrigerated tanks and silos. Ammonia liquid which collects in the accumulator is returned to the liquid line by a pumper drum.  The major discharge from th"

The condensed liquid is returned to the high pressure receiver where it is fed to the refrigeration equipment.\n\nVarious safety systems are part of the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system.   These include pressure relief valves and safety interlocks.  Pressure relief valves protect the compressor discharge, pumper drum, suction accumulators and other pressure vessels, and suction lines from over pressurization.  Safety valves are also used in back pressure valve bypasses (i.e., tanks and silos).  Safety interlocks include high pressure, low pressure, and oil pressure cut-outs for the compressors, as well as high level floats for the suction trap.  The first level float turns off the king valve to reduce the amount of liquid going to the system and returning to the trap.  The second float sounds an alarm in the control room and plant, and shuts off the compressors.  The high pressure cut-out for each compressor is set at 225 psig.  A system high pressure alarm sounds at 195 psig and turns off all compressors when the high side pressure exceeds 200 psig on the Mercoid controls or 210 psig on the PLC.  The Mercoid controller must be manually reset.  An alarm also occurs if the PLC monitors greater than 40 psig suction pressure for at least 5 minutes.\nA release of ammonia that could affect the environment is unlikely for the following reasons:\n* Many of the high pressure liquid lines are located in enclosed areas that could help to contain such a release, and the outside piping is elevated to promote dispersion;\n* Industrial standards were followed for the manufacture and quality control of these lines;\n* Ammonia is not corrosive in this service;\n* Most of the lines are elevated to minimize potential damage from fork lifts;\n* The facility has a preventive maintenance program in place to maintain the on"

To help minimize the probability and severity of an ammonia release, a prevention program that satisfies the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Process Safety Management (PSM) of Highly Hazardous Chemicals  standard (29 CFR 1910.119) has been implemented.  The key components of the prevention program are summarized below:\n* The development, documentation, and operator availability of critical process safety information regarding the hazards of ammonia, the design basis of the system, and the equipment.  This information is used to fully understand and safely operate the ammonia refrigeration system.\n* The development of an extensive employee participation program, which includes employees from all levels of the organization and from all areas within the plant (i.e., production and maintenance).  This program also assures that employees that utilize the ammonia system and are most knowledgeable about it are best able to easily, effectively, and regularly recommend changes or improvements which enhance safety.\n* The performance of a formal process hazard analysis (PHA), using the What-if... technique.
