              "Description": "The Sulfur Trioxide/Sulfur Dioxide Sulfonation process consists of three production units interconnected to a common Sulfur Trioxide storage tank.\n\n\n\nThe Sulfur Trioxide storage tank is located inside of a heated and enclosed dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank.  This dike as well as all he Sulfur Trioxide processing equipment is located inside of a concrete wall and covered process building.  Sulfur Trioxide is received in 2,600 gallon tank trucks which are then unloaded to a 7,000 gallon tank in a concrete dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank truck.  All connections to the tank truck are made of hard piping.  The Sulfur Trioxide unloading operators undergo an extensive training program and yearly certification is required.\n\n\n\nThe Sulfur Dioxide storage tank is located in a covered, outside, concrete dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank.  Sulfur dioxide is received in 3,500 gallon tank trucks which are then unloaded in a concrete dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank truck.  Sulfur Dioxide unloading is infrequent and has not occurred in the past 5 years.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide detectors are placed in 12 strategic locations throughout the process building and storage areas.  The detectors activate both visual and audible alarms at the control station.\n\n\n\nAll processing vessels are designed and tested to ASME codes and fitted with relief systems. Each relief valve is installed downstream of a rupture disk to effect isolation from the process chemicals.  All positive displacement type pumping systems are fitted with internal or bypass type relief valves.\n\n\n\nAll production units are computer-controlled utilizing a PLC system with equipment interlocks. These interlocks prevent inadvertent startups and allow for orderly shutdown in the event of loss of power, instrument air, steam or other process upsets.  All process equipment and valves are designed to shut down to a safe condition.  All critical process parameters utilize alarming routines through the control system that activates both visual and audible alarms in the control station. Some critical process monitors can trigger an automated shutdown to the safe condition.\n\n\n\nAn emergency shutdown system stops transfer pumps, closes isolation and control valves and sounds an audible alarm thus limiting the amount of a toxic release and alerting personnel of an emergency situation.  The emergency shutdown system can be activated by pressing a conspicuously marked red palm button in any one of three locations in the process building.  The SO3 unloading process includes a separate emergency shutdown system that closes isolation valves at the unloading station and switches power off to the truck pump. Training on the use of the emergency systems occurs at least once a year.\n\n\n\nAll production units are registered under International Standard Organization ISO 9001:2008 and are in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard. Process and operating procedure changes are processed under a sophisticated Management of Change and Document Control system that assesses the safety, environmental and technical impacts of a process change.\n\n\n\nAn operator training program is in place that utilizes a combination of classroom training and demonstration of competency with evaluation by written test and observation. Operators receive training on new and revised operating procedures as well as personal safety and process safety topics.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical integrity of the process and control equipment, relief systems and instrumentation is maintained by preventive maintenance and equipment calibration programs.",

              "Description": "The D-300 Sulfur Trioxide Sulfonation process consists of one production unit interconnected to a Sulfur Trioxide storage tank.\n\n\n\nThe Sulfur Trioxide storage tank is located inside of a heated and enclosed dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank.  This dike as well as all the Sulfur Trioxide processing equipment is located inside of a concrete wall and covered process building.  Sulfur Trioxide is received in 2,600 gallon tank trucks which are then unloaded to a 7,000 gallon tank in a concrete dike that can contain the entire contents of the tank truck.  All connections to the tank truck are made of hard piping.  The Sulfur Trioxide unloading operators undergo an extensive training program and yearly certification is required.\n\n\n\nAll processing vessels are designed and tested to ASME codes and fitted with relief systems.  Each relief valve is installed downstream of a rupture disk to effect isolation from the process chemicals.  All positive displacement type pumping systems are fitted with internal or bypass type relief valves.  There are four sulfur trioxide detectors with audible alarm in the processing area as well as external notification system.\n\n\n\nThe Sulfur Trioxide flow rate and quantity to the production unit is computer-controlled utilizing a PLC system with equipment interlocks.  These interlocks prevent inadvertent startups and allow for orderly shutdown in the event of loss of power, instrument air or other process upsets.  All process equipment and valves are designed to shutdown to a safe condition.  All critical process parameters utilize alarming routines through the control system that activates both visual and audible alarms in the control station.\n\n\n\nAn emergency shutdown system stops transfer pumps, closes isolation and control valves and sounds an audible alarm thus limiting the amount of a toxic release and alerting personnel of an emergency situation.  The emergency shutdown system can be activated by pressing a conspicuously marked red palm button in any one of three locations in the process building.  Training on the use of the emergency systems occurs at least once a year.\n\n\n\nAll production units are registered under International Standard Organization ISO 9001:2008 and are in compliance with the OSHA Process Safety Management standard.  Process and operating procedure changes are processed under a sophisticated Management of Change and Document Control system that assesses the safety, environmental and technical impacts of a process change.\n\n\n\nAn operator training program is in place that utilizes a combination of classroom training and demonstration of competency with evaluation by demonstration and observation.  Operators receive training on new and revised operating procedures as well as personal safety and process safety topics.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical integrity of the process and control equipment, relief systems and instrumentation is maintained by preventive maintenance and equipment calibration programs.",

Pilot Chemical holds to the ChemStewards environmental, health, safety and security principles as developed by the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA).  Pilot Chemical is also committed to the maintenance of a quality management system which meets the requirements of the International Standards Organization ISO 9001:2008.  This commitment requires the work force to focus on the production of a quality product through continuous improvement in all phases of its operations.\n\n\n\nThe Pilot Chemical Company of Ohio, Lockland Plant occupies approximately three acres in an open, relatively flat, industrial area, north of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The original facility was constructed in 1964.  The facility produces detergent grade sulfonic acid, synthetic detergents, surfactants and emulsifiers through batch sulfonation and neutralizer systems for use in the industrial and institutional markets.\n\n\n\nThe regulated substances on site exceeding threshold quantities are Sulfur Dioxide and Sulfur Trioxide, both of which are toxics.\n\n\n\nSulfur Dioxide is a clear, water-white liquid at temperatures below its atmospheric-pressure boiling point of 14 deg. F.  Sulfur Dioxide is stored on site as a liquefied, compressed gas at a pressure near 100 psi.  Sulfur Dioxide vapors are colorless and heavier than air, but are extremely irritating and suffocating at concentrations above 30 ppm.  With a distinctive rotten egg smell, Sulfur Dioxide has good warning properties with an odor threshold of 0.5 ppm.  Sulfur Dioxide is stable and non-flammable in either the gaseous or liquid state.\n\n\n\nSulfur Trioxide is a clear, colorless, oily liquid at temperatures between its freezing and boiling points, which are 90 deg. F and 113 deg. F, respectively.  Sulfur Trioxide has a strong irritating odor and is very hygroscopic, reacting violently with water.  Sulfur Trioxide f"
