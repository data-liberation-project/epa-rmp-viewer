This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training personnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of the facility?s processes.  It is the practice of Enterprise Products Operating L.P. (Enterprise) to implement reasonable controls to prevent foreseeable releases of substances.  However, if a release does occur, trained personnel will respond to, control and contain the release.\n\n\nDescription of the Stationary Source and Regulated Substances\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant located in Lincoln County, Wyoming is owned by Enterprise Gas Processing L.L.C. and is operated by Enterprise.\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant is a combined processing complex comprised of two separate gas processing plants, designated as Plant 1 and Plant 2. The two plants are designed to utilize a solid bed adsorption or \"quick cycle\" process to recover primarily pentane and heavier natural gas liquids from the inlet gas.  Smaller amounts of methane, ethane, propane and butanes are also recovered in the process, but the plant includes liquid stabilization equipment to remove the lighter components from the produced liquids and re-inject them in the outlet gas stream   The primary purpose of the facility is to control the hydrocarbon dew point of the residue gas.  Produced natural gas is delivered to the facility from a gas gathering system and inlet gas pipeline.  Finished products are residual natural gas and extracted hydrocarbon liquids which are removed from the plant by pipeline systems.\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant was evaluated to determine if any regulated flammable or toxic s"

Enterprise identified the regulated substances and quantities kept on site based on process knowledge.\n\nListed flammable substances which are present above the threshold quantities at the Pioneer Silica Gel Plant are natural gas (methane), ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and pentane.  The Plant is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulation and is classified as a Program Level 1 site under the EPA RMP program as a result of its remote location.\n\n\nOffsite Consequence Analysis Results\n\nThe offsite consequence analysis will not be reflected in the executive summary but rather is reflected in the data components.  There are flammable substances on site and no toxic substances above the threshold quantity.  The limited amount of flammable liquids results in a very small worst case scenario distance, and RMP Program Level 1 registration.\n\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the Pioneer Silica Gel Plant.  The processes at the plant are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Risk Management Program (RMP) regulation (Program 1), and are also subject to the OSHA?s PSM standard.  This summary addresses each of the PSM program elements and describes the management system in place to implement the accident prevention program which is required only by the facility OSHA PSM regulation coverage..\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nActive employee participation and involvement in the development and implementation of the plant?s PSM program is an important step toward achieving the objective to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.  Employee involvement helps to insure that all perspectives regarding PSM compliance and accident prevention are considered and that the best ideas are implemented.  Ope"

This information includes materials of construction, design pressure ratings, temperature ratings and electrical rating of equipment.  This information in combination with written procedures and trained personnel provides a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and facility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis (PHA)\n\nThe Pioneer Silica Gel Plant has a comprehensive program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards.\n\nEnterprise primarily uses the hazard and operability (HAZOP) and What-if/Checklist method analysis technique to perform these evaluations.  The analyses are conducted using a team of Enterprise staff which has operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and the team makes suggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.\n\nThe PHA team findings are forwarded to local and corporate management for resolution.  Implementation of mitigation options in response to PHA findings is based on a relative risk ranking assigned by the PHA team.  This ranking helps ensure that potential accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options in response to PHA team findings are tracked until they are completed.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help insure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design s"
