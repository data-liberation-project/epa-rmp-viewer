PG&E Generating operates the\nCedar Bay facility in strict accordance with stringent policies and protocols designed to protect the\nhealth and safety of our employees and neighbors, as well as the environment. Responsibility for\nsafety and environmental performance at the plant is shared by every employee. This message is\ncommunicated through ongoing training programs designed to raise awareness and build necessary\non-the-job skills. Performance in these areas are regularly evaluated through audits, assessments, and\nother mechanisms, with the goal of measuring progress and identifying areas for continued\nimprovement.  \n \nAs is the case for many facilities, Cedar Bay Generating Plant's participation in the RMP program\nis triggered by the use of only one substance (ammonium hydroxide) on-site in quantities that exceed\na threshold amount. At this and other PG&E Generating facilities, ammonia is the key ingredient in\nthe facilities' air pollution control systems. In both the design and operation of our plants, among the\nmost important priorities is the minimization of air emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx).\nNitrogen Oxides are a primary contributor to smog. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and\nstate regulators have identified NOx emissions reductions as one of the most important keys to\nachieving national air quality improvement goals. In order to help achieve this objective, the Cedar\nBay facility employs emissions control technology that uses ammonia to reduce nitrogen oxide\nemissions. This technology enables the plant to achieve NOx emission rates that are the lowest for\nany facility of its kind.\n             \nThe Cedar Bay Generating Facility (S.I.C. Code 4911) uses one regulated substance, aqueous\nammonia  (CAS Number 1336-21-6) "

The worst-case release scenario was assumed\nto be the release of the entire amount of aqueous ammonia in storage for duration of 10 minutes. \nThe alternative release scenario selected for the Facility was a failure scenario developed during the\nprocess hazard review and analysis.  In this scenario, a 0.50-inch diameter drain valve located at the\nbottom of the storage tank fails and separates from the tank as the result of internal corrosion.  The\nrelease is contained in the passive mitigation system consisting of an 800 square foot dike\ncontainment.  For both scenarios, the off-site consequence analysis indicated that off-site receptors\ncould be potentially impacted by the release of aqueous ammonia.  Although off-site areas would\nbe impacted, the Facility believes that safety procedures and mitigation measures will reduce the\npotential for off-site consequences and subsequent risks to the surrounding environment.  The\nFacility's safety devices include leak detectors, alarms, and automatic system shut-off devices. \n\nIn order to fulfill the requirements of the Risk Management Program (RMP), the Facility has\ndeveloped an accidental release prevention program and emergency action plan. The accidental\nrelease prevention program satisfies the requirements for the USEPA RMP and the Occupational\nSafety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) program.  The\nprevention program ensures that the Facility is operated under safe conditions and that any risk of\nan accidental release of aqueous ammonia is minimized.  The program has been written to reduce\nthe potential of an accidental release due to human error or equipment failure.  In order to prevent\nthe release o"

Training also plays a vital part in the\nprogram.  Employees and contractors working near or on the SNCR process are required to be\ntrained in the process and the hazards of aqueous ammonia.   \n\nTo prevent equipment failure that could result in an accidental release, the Facility's program ensures\nthat equipment is inspected, tested, and preventive maintenance performed in accordance with\naccepted engineering practices and includes manufacturer's recommendations.  All equipment\npertaining to the SNCR process is maintained, inspected, and tested in accordance with the planned\nmaintenance schedule.   \n\nAll existing and proposed future equipment has been designed according to applicable standards and\ncodes.  The Facility maintains records and documentation on equipment inspection and tests. \nPrecautions are taken to ensure that new equipment and processes are inspected and tested, that all\nchanges on the process are authorized, and employees are informed of changes.\n\nThe Facility performed a Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) to address the hazards in the SNCR\nprocess and to evaluate and control where the potential for an aqueous ammonia release exists. \nEmployees were involved in determining hazards of the process and subsequent consequences.  The\nSNCR process was found to be operating safely and no changes were recommended. \n  \nActive employee participation will ensure the success of the RMP at the Facility.  Employees have\nbeen assigned various tasks to ensure that all elements of the RMP are implemented.

Therefore, in\naccordance with 40 CFR 68.90, an Emergency Response Program is not required for the Facility. \nIn the event that an aqueous ammonia release occurs, all employees are required to evacuate the\nprocess area and report the incident.

As the operators\nof this facility, PG&E Generating takes seriously its commitment to accident prevention and\neffective emergency response. While no industrial site is entirely free from risk, it is our goal,\nthrough continuous improvement, to manage risks, as effectively as possible.
