The PHAs are conducted using a team of people with experience in engineering and Chlorination Process operation and a leader with experience in process hazard analysis techniques. This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and/or mitigation measures, when appropriate.  The team then prepares a written report describing the results of the analysis, including a list of recommendations ranked according to relative risk ratings assigned by the team.  Responsibility to resolve the recommendations is assigned to the Treatment Plant Operations Supervisor and is tracked through completion.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, the KUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency until the Chlorination Process is no longer in operation.  The results and findings of these updates are documented and retained.  The team findings are forwarded to the KUB Property Owners Association for consideration, and the final resolution of the findings is documented and retained.\n\n4.3  Operating Procedures\n\nKUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant engineers, operators, and supervisors work together to develop and maintain written operating procedures to define how tasks related to the Chlorination Process operation should be safely performed.  These written procedures address var"

      "SummaryText": "ng activities that could result in fires or explosions in the processes at our facility.  The KUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant utilizes a Safe Work Permit form designed after the OSHA fire prevention and protection requirements found in 29 CFR 1910.252(a).  Personnel who are to perform the Hot Work are required to complete the form which is reviewed by the area supervisor.  The form must be approved before work can proceed.  Training in the use of the Safe Work Permit form is provided to all affected personnel.\n \n4.12  Contractors\n \nThe KUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant established a program to help ensure that contractors who are used to supplement the workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction conduct their work in a safe manner.  Under the program, the record of all contractors is reviewed to ensure that KUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant hires contractors who can safely perform work on or near covered process equipment.  Our program ensures that contractors:\n \n* perform their work in a safe manner,\n* have the appropriate knowledge and skills,\n* are aware of the hazards in the workplace,\n* understand what to do in the event of an emergency,\n* understand and follow the KUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant's safety rules, and\n* inform KUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant personnel of any hazards identified during their work.\n \nProgram efforts are accomplished by providing contractors with:\n \n* a process overview,\n* information about safety and health hazards,\n* emergency response plan requirements, and\n* safe work practices prior to beginning work.\n \n\n5.0  Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n \nIndustry standards are followed at the KUB Kuwahee Wastewater Treatment Plant to help ensure safe handling of chlorine.  The vendor supplies chlorine via a Department of Transportation (DOT) approved truck and in DOT approved 1 ton cylinders.  The chlorination process equipment is designed and constructed with state-of-the-art material"
