The Wildcat Hill WWTP has prepared a Risk Management Plan (RMP) in accordance with the EPA and OSHA regulatory requirements.  A brief overview of the RMP and the associated policies at this facility is described below:\n\n\n\nPrevention and Response Policies\n\nThe City takes an active role in preventing accidental releases by ensuring that its employees are properly trained in the safe operation of covered processes and the safe handling of treatment chemicals. The City has established and maintains procedures for emergency notification and response.  These are reviewed with employees on a periodical basis and revised to accommodate changes in staffing when they occur. To increase employee safety and awareness, the City:\n\nmaintains up-to-date safety information and operating procedures,\n\nperforms regular preventative maintenance, \n\nprovides periodic refresher training on safe handling of chemicals, and \n\nconducts periodic safety drills.\n\n\n\nFacility Description and Regulated Substances\n\nWildcat Hill WWTP disinfects wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial sources through a series of physical, chemical, and biological treatment operations that include:\n\npreliminary treatment,\n\nprimary sedimentation,\n\nIFAS,\n\nsecondary sedimentation,\n\nfiltration\n\nchlorination, and dechlorination\n\nThe regulated substances handled at Wildcat Hill WWTP are chlorine and sulfur dioxide. \n\n\n\nRelease Scenarios \n\nWorst-case and alternative release scenarios have been determined after careful review of the regulation and consideration of the storage vessel configuration at the facility. The release scenarios have been modeled in accordance with the regulation. Information from the Process Hazard Analysis was used to model alternative scenario. In order to create an alternative scenario model meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 68.28(b)(1), an outdo"

      "SummaryText": "or scenario was chosen that includes no mitigation. Use of a  conservative scenario allows us to ensure appropriate safe operating procedures are in place outside of enclosures where other types of mitigation exist.\n\n\n\nPrevention Steps for Chlorine and Sulfur Dioxide\n\nThe prevention program fulfills the requirements of the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) rule and the EPA RMP rule, and includes:\n\nRMP Management System, Compliance Audits,Process Hazard Analysis, Process Safety Information, formal and on-the-job training programs, written operating procedures, process equipment Mechanical Integrity program, Management of Change, Pre-startup Review,\n\nIncident Investigations,Employee Participation, Safe Work Permits,  Contractor Safety Program and Emergency Preparedness.\n\n\n\nAccident History \n\nThere has been no release of either covered chemical in the past five years \n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program \n\nWildcat Hill WTTP has established and maintains an emergency action plan that is coordinated with local response agencies. The goals of the program are to protect on-site employees from the hazardous effects of a release and to minimize the effects of releases on the general public. The program is routinely reviewed and updated to reflect personnel and regulatory changes \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes for Improved Safety \n\nIdeas for changes to improve safety are actively sought from employees. Employee meetings that focus on safety issues are held regularly at the facility. Employees are encouraged and trained to recognize hazards and present ideas to eliminate them or to minimize the potential consequences of those hazards. \n\n\n\nDuring the development of this RMP document, process hazard analyses of the chlorine and sulfur dioxide systems were conducted with key employees to fulfill the prevention program requirements. During these sessions, recommendations were made for the purpose of improving safety and preventing accidental chemical releases. Each recommendation will be or has "

In addition, the exercise provided all affected employees with a heightened awareness of safety issues related to the covered processes.\n\n\n\nSpecific changes in progress include an overhaul of operating procedures, updated process area P&ID's, improvements to refresher training program including addition of hoist-specific refresher training component, and updated maintenance schedule to include more frequent inspection of PPE."
