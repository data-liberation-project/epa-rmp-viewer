Tank P-50-5, which represents the facility's worst-case VAM release scenario, was subsequently placed into VAM service for the first time on February 25, 2010.  VAM is received into this tank via barge delivery using a dedicated marine dock line.  Product is then shipped outbound according to customer requirements via marine parcel tankers that load at Stolthaven Houston's existing Ship Dock 2/3.  VAM may also be transferred periodically directly from barges to rail tank cars with no intermediate storage.\n\nAs a result of the VAM storage project in P Tank Farm, piping modifications were completed in various facility manifolds and at Tank P-50-5 to eliminate the use of hoses in VAM service to the greatest extent possible within the terminal.  A VAM filter-pot was also installed.  Stolthaven Houston's permanent, stationary fire-water protection systems in the immediate area of Tank P-50-5 were also upgraded to provide additional cooling water as-needed in the event of an emergency incident involving any of the the facility's flammable liquid storage tanks in close proximity.  Existing portable water delivery systems also remain available should they be needed in the event of an emergency.\n\nEmployee training related to the specifics of VAM storage and transfer at the Stolthaven Houston Terminal was first conducted in December of 2008 and then again in April of 2009 in preparation of receiving this RMP regulated substance into the facility's A Tank Farm in 2009.  Although current facility employees are experienced in the procedures necessary to safely handle VAM, additional safety training related specifically to VAM storage in P Tank Farm was conducted in December of 2009.  Specific topics covered during this employee review of safe VAM handling procedures included, but were not limited to,"
