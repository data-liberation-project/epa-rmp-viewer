Sam Kane Beef is a leader in developing and implementing new beef processing technologies in an effort to provide customers with the highest possible quality meats and services.  The facility processes beef for distribution to thousands of customers throughout the United States and many foreign countries.  To maintain product quality and freshness, during processing and storage, the inventory is kept either refrigerated or frozen.  Cooling is achieved through the use of three ammonia refrigeration systems containing a significant quantity of ammonia within the system's boundary.\nAmmonia contained within the refrigeration systems is a regulated substance under both the EPA and OSHA regulations.  At Sam Kane Beef Processors, Inc., the maximum inventory of ammonia exceeds the regulatory threshold of 10,000 pounds.\nSam Kane Beef Processors is committed to protecting the public, its employees, and the environment from any accidental releases of hazardous materials used.  We have implemented safety, environmental protection, and risk management programs to prevent hazardous materials releases. \nIf there is an accidental release, we will immediately call for emergency response to minimize the effect of the release and notify the public of any actions necessary to ensure public protection, through the Emergency 911 phone system.\nAccidental Release Prevention Steps\nSam Kane Beef Processors is committed to public safety, personnel safety, continued reliable operation, and regulatory compliance.  Based on this commitment, the Plant Manager along with the Plant Maintenance Manager has assumed overall responsibility for the development and implementation of the Risk Management Program.  The Plant Manager has also clearly defined accountability and responsibility for each of the prevention program elements to meet both EPA Risk Management and OSHA Process Safety Management requirements.\nTo ensure that release sc"

The multifaceted program includes the use of:\n> Ammonia gas detectors and alarms to rapidly alert operators to any problems;\n> Process safety information to document the safe process design;\n> Process hazards analyses to evaluate the chemical and process hazards;\n> Operating procedures to ensure that the system is operated safely;\n> Maintenance, inspection and testing to ensure that the system is maintained according to applicable standards and manufacturer's recommendations;\n> Training, Hot Work Permits, Contractor Safety, and Employee Participation Programs to ensure that all employees and contractors working on and around the processes are aware of the hazards, can perform their job duties safely and know the actions to be taken in an emergency;\n> Management of Change and Pre-startup Safety Reviews to ensure that changes are documented, analyzed, and kept within the design basis;\n> Incident Investigation procedure to investigate each incident and \"near misses\" to determine root causes and make needed safety improvements; and,\n> Periodic Compliance Audits to ensure that our programs are working as they should to protect both the public and employees.\nFive-Year Accident History\nWithin the past five years, Sam Kane Beef Processors has  had (1) accidental release that resulted in NO injuries, property damage, or environmental damage. During this September 2007 accidental release there were NO off-site consequences.

The Risk Management Program will be maintained to reduce the risk of accidental releases and each year we will conduct training, review procedures, maintain the equipment and follow safe work practices.  Periodically, we will audit our program, review our Process Hazard Analysis and coordinate with the community emergency response organization.
