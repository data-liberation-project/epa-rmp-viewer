In this way we promote overall plant, worker, and public safety.  These programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemical including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities.  Any group of vessels which are interconnected and separate vessels which are located such that a hazardous chemical could be involved in a potential release shall be considered a single process.\n\nOur safety programs prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  These rules are detailed and improved as necessary.  They are also communicated to and accepted by all employees at the facility.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is used as a refrigerant at Petit Jean Poultry.   Mechanical refrigeration is a thermodynamic process rather than a chemical process.  Ammonia, the refrigerant is used as a heat transfer media to maintain a desired temperature in an enclosed environment.  The refrigeration cycle consists of four processes: evaporation, condensation, compression, and expansion.  Evaporation and condensation are designed to alter the quantity of energy associated with the refrigerant.  Compression and expansion are designed to change the availability of the associated energy.  The ammonia"

      "SummaryText": "refrigeration cycle is in a closed system utilizing fluid temperature, pressure, and latent heat of vaporization for cooling.  To evaporate liquid ammonia to a vapor, latent heat of vaporization must be applied to the liquid.\n\nPetit Jean Poultry utilizes the ammonia refrigeration system for keeping plant processing areas at a constant temperature, preserving product, chilling water and  making ice. \nAlthough the ammonia refrigeration system at Danville contains under the threshold quantity of ammonia, Petit Jean Poultry will comply with a Program 3 prevention program.  This should help to provide a safer environment for employees and the community, plus make the refrigeration system more efficient.  All elements of the prevention program have been implemented.  This plant has not experienced a reportable accidental release in the last five years.  \n\nPetit Jean Poultry' emergency response program is based on the OSHA requirements for Emergency Action Plans (29 CFR 1910.38 and 1910.119) and HAZWOPER (29 CFR 1910.120).  We have trained employees for emergency response and maintain a written emergency response plan.  This plan is coordinated with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and the Danville Fire Department.  We conduct annual drills for implementation of the emergency response plan at the facility with the participation of the LEPC and fire department."
