Due to the necessity of a timely response associated with a propylene release, Huntsman has committed the resources necessary to respond defensively to emergencies at the Longview,TX facility.  The primary responders to emergencies at the facility will be the Longview Fire Dept.  Huntsman has trained operators that are able to assess and mitigate a propylene release in minutes.  In addition, our facility regularly meets with outside responders, local fire departments, and local emergency planning committees in order to establish emergency response procedures necessary to protect our surrounding public and the environment.\n\nOur facility and the regulated substances handled:\n\nThe Huntsman facility produces polypropylene and is a Program 3 covered process due to the onsite storage and use of propylene, which is used at the facility to manufacture polypropylene.\n\nThe production facility is addressed as a process in a joint RMPlan with Eastman Chemical Company, Texas Operation.  The process addressed in this plan is the feeding and storage of propylene.  \n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps:\n\nThis facility is covered by both USEPA's Risk Management Program rule, as well as, OSHA's Process Safety Management Rule for the propylene covered process.  The facility maintains a  program consisting of a written management system that complies with both USEPA's and OSHA's requirements.  The backbone of the program is the Management of Change Procedure.  This procedure enables the facility to initiate and complete process changes associated with the propylene system while maintaining the Process Safety and Risk Management Program requirements at the facility.  \n\nBoth the wor"

      "SummaryText": "st-case and alternative release scenarios were modeled based on equipment failure, therefore the mechanical integrity element of the program is key in preventing releases from the propylene process.  This facility has an active preventative maintenance, testing and inspection program of the propylene system.  The mechanical integrity program provides ongoing assurance that the propylene system is maintained in safe operating condition.\n\nThe five year accident history:\n\nThis facility has not experienced a release of propylene over the last five years.\n \nThe emergency response program:\n\nOur employees are trained and equipped to respond quickly to releases of propylene in a defensive manner.  The operators routinely undergo training and participate in drills with the local fire department.  The plant has coordinated emergency response procedures with emergency response agencies in the community.  In case of a release that could result in an offsite impact, the Gregg County Sheriff's Office would be immediately notified, who in turn notifies the City of Longview and Harrison County Sheriff's Office.  These agencies would notify the public.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety:\n\nThis facility strives to continuously improve safety through the analysis of and treatment of potential hazards, thorough investigation of accidents and near misses and active participation in trade associations and safety organizations."
