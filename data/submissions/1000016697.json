The Facility Policy \n\nThe owners, management, and employees of Ely Grain Company are committed to the prevention of any accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia. If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities, to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment. \n\n2. Facility Information \n\n. The primary activity at the facility is the storage of fertilizers for sale to farmers. \n\n-Anhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application for crop production nutrients. \n\n-The maximum quantity stored or handled would be 56,078 pounds in our two 6,cx:XJ gallon tanks. \n\n3. The worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario. \n\na. The worst-case release scenario would be the release of the total contents of a storage tank released as a gas over 10 minutes. The maximum quantity released would be 28,039 pounds, which represents the volume of the largest storage tank at 85A?.(, capacity as limited by design standards. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.63 miles. \nb. The alternative release scenario based on the most likely potential incident is a release from a break in a transfer hose. The distance to the endpoint (point of dispersion to 200 ppm) is 0.46 miles. \n\n4. The accidental release prevention program. \n\nThe facility has implemented the provisions of \"Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1\", published by The American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), 29 CFR 1910.111, \"Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia\". \n5. The Five-Year Accident History \n\nThere have been no accidental releases of anhydrous ammonia in the past five years that: \n\n- have ca"
