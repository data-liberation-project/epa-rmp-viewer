According to EPA's RMP Comp\n the distance to endpoint is 3.20 miles. There are residences, a school and recreation areas within the\n distance to endpoint, with a total of 322 people being affected.\n\nGeneral Accident Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps:\n This facility complies with EPA's accident prevention rule and all applicable federal, state and local codes\n and regulations. This facility is annually inspected by in-house personnel and by the Iowa Department\n of Agriculture.\n\nFive-Year Accident History:\n We have never had an accident involving anhydrous ammonia that caused death, injuries, property or\n environmental damage, evacuations or shelterings in place.\n\nThe Emergency Response Program:\n In the event of an emergency involving our anhydrous ammoina facility, it is our policy to notify the Woden\n Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency. We have discussed this policy with\n the fire department. Members of the fire department have inspected our ahydrous ammonia facility.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Saftey:\n None"
