A brief description of the following elements required by 40 CFR 68.155 is provided.\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies at the stationary source [40 CFR 68.155(a)]:\nThe U.S. Navy Public Works Center (PWC), Guam in accordance with directives from the Department of Defense and Department of the Navy maintains, implements and updates plans and instructions for the protection of worker health and welfare, and for protection of the environment.\n\nThe stationary source and regulated substances handled [40 CFR 68.155(b)]:\nThe U.S. Navy Public Works Center Fena Booster Pump Station chlorinates raw source water for the Navy's drinking water supply system on Guam.  Chlorine is used in a process at this location in amounts exceeding 2,500 pounds and as such requires compliance with the CAA 112(r) RMP rule codified in 40 CFR Part 68.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario [40 CFR 68.155(c)]:\nThe worst case scenario is a failure involving two (2) storage cylinders containing a maximum allowed amount of 2,998 pounds of chlorine.  These cylinders are housed within an enclosed structure that serves to further mitigate the chlorine gas release rate.  Furthermore, the facility is unmanned and restricts worker access to the site only as required to change empty cylinders.  The resulting toxic vapor cloud will reach an end-point concentration off-site, however, this facility is located at a remote location and has no public receptors within the effective radius.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps [40 CFR 68.155(d)]:\nIn addition to directive"

      "SummaryText": "s issued by the Department of the Navy, specific procedures and practices for prevention of accidental releases are developed and maintained by the PWC Utilities Department in conjunction with Safety and Environmental Departments.  Also, facility workers are provided with annual training in chlorine safety procedures.\n\nThe five-year accident history [40 CFR 68.155(e)]:\nNo reportable accidental releases have occurred at this facility within the last 5 years.  \n\nThe emergency response program [40 CFR 68.155(f)]:\nEmergency response procedures are incorporated within a PWC Guam Chlorine Spill Response instruction as well as an Oil and Hazardous Substance (OHS) Spill Response Plan both of which are coordinated with the Federal Fire Department and   local emergency response agencies and the local environmental protection agency.  PWC Guam maintains the capability to respond to hazardous material spills at its facilities and for other Naval activities on Guam.\n\nPlanned changes to improve safety [40 CFR 68.155(g)]:\nNo additional changes are required.  Existing controls are adequate and will be revised as needed.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Navy Public Works Center, Guam has provided the necessary information to the local emergency response commission, however, the State Emergency Response Plan is currently being drafted."
