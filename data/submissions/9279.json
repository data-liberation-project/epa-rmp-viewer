The City provides potable water to their service area, which coincides with the City limits.  The facility is capable of treating 12 million gallons per day of water.  \nAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policy\nThe City is committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees, the surrounding community, and the environment; therefore, it is the City's policy to manage a safe and healthy workplace, protect the environment and maintain compliance with safety, health, and environmental regulations: 40 CFR 68 as well as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119. This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances.\nStationary Sources and Regulated Substances\nThe City is subject to Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act because chlorine, a regulated substance, is present at the facility in amounts greater than 2,500 pounds.  The City is required to treat the water supply so that it meets or exceeds the drinking water quality standards of the California Department of Health Services.  The City uses chlorine (the 112(r) regulated su"

The City's chlorine disinfection process consists of one-ton chlorine cylinders, a containment vessel, chlorinators, and a piping system that is all under vacuum.  The process and storage cylinders can contain a maximum amount of 10,000 pounds of chlorine.\nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nAs required by 40 CFR 68 Subpart B, the City has evaluated a worst-case release scenario for chlorine using the parameters specified by the EPA.  The City's worst-case release scenario is the rupture of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine and the loss of the entire contents over a 10-minute period.  The distance to the toxic endpoint was determined using EPA's RMP Guidance for Waste Water Treatment Plants Reference Tables or Equations.  The following paragraphs provide details of the chosen scenarios.\n\nThe toxic liquid released is assumed to form a 1-cm deep pool from which evaporation takes place.  The entire pool is estimated to evaporate over 10 minutes.  The released quantity has not been limited by administrative controls.  At Class F atmospheric stability and 1.5 m/s windspeed, the maximum distance of 1.3 miles is obtained corresponding to a toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario was developed following EPA regulations and is not considered to be a likely release scenario.  Historically throughout the chlorine industry, the rupture of one-ton cylinders is rare.  The rupture of a cylinder outside the building would probably only occur during unloading of the cylinder.  This would be a daytime activity.  The meteorological condition required to be used by the EPA is F stability class.  By definition this stability class only occurs at nighttime.  Therefore, the results of this worst case offsite consequence analysis are extremely conservative.\nAlternative Release Scenario\nA more realistic release scenario (alternative release) was developed by the City taking into consideration the history of operation's experience and the hazard"

These analyses were conducted under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations promulgated as Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Chapter 1910, Section 119 (29 CFR 1910.119).\nThe most likely alternative release scenario for chlorine involves a vapor release from a break in the flexible 1/4\" pigtail tubing.  Potentially 9 lbs of chlorine per minute is released.  However the release is assumed to occur within the Chlortainer chlorine containment vessel, which is located inside the chlorine building.  The Chlortainer vessel is a cylindrical steel ASME pressure vessel.  A flexible pipe connects the chlorine cylinder to a high-pressure penetration fitting in the containment vessel.  A spring-loaded valve, held open by nitrogen pressure, serves as a fail-safe shut-off for the chlorine line.  The valve shuts on loss of power, leak detection, or operator action to instantly mitigate a release.  The containment vessel will control at least 90 percent of the release.  Therefore, only 0.9 lbs of chlorine per minute is released.  An operator will be in attendance and should be able to contain the leak within a minute.  Therefore, it is anticipated that less than 1 lb of chlorine could be released.  Under neutral weather conditions, the maximum distance to the toxic endpoint of 0.0087 mg/L of chlorine is <0.1 miles.  This is the minimum distance on the reference tables.  We do not anticipate that the release will go offsite and there will be no impacts.\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention program requirements set out under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.
