All applicable procedures of 40 CFR 68.170 are addressed in the\nplan, which seeks to provide for employee safety, public health and response agency\ninteraction.\n\nMacon Water Authority utilizes chlorine to disinfect raw water pulled from the Ocmulgee\nRiver at the Riverside Water Treatment Plant and operations will begin at the Town Creek Water\nTreatment Plant sometime in the Fall of 1999.  Once operations at Town Creek are at the\nneeded capacity the Riverside Water Treatment  Plant will be closed.  Chlorine is also used at the\nLower Poplar and Rocky Creek Wastewater Treatment Plants to treat wastewater before it\nis returned to the Ocmulgee River.  In addition, the Rocky Creek Plant also uses\nAnhydrous Ammonia to assist in treating wastewater.  Chlorination processes include\n(liquid) chlorination cylinders, chlorination equipment, and instrument room, electrical\nequipment, and process specific safety equipment.  Ammonia processes include (liquid)\nAnhydrous Ammonia above ground tanks, an instrument room, electrical equipment, and\nprocess specific safety equipment.\n\nFor each chlorination process accidental release modeling was performed for the respective\narea to determine potential consequences associated with operating failures resulting in\naccidental chlorine release.  The first \"worst case\" scenario, defined by EPA, states that\n\"the owner or operator shall assume that the. . . maximum quantity in the largest vessel...is\nreleased as a gas over 10 minutes.\"  The \"alternative scenario\" is \"more likely to occur than\nthe worst-case release scenario.\"  Macon Water Authority has no incident history.\n\nIn each case, atmospheric dispersion modeling was performed to de"

When atmospheric\ndispersion modeling for this unlikely scenario was performed using the RMP* Comp ver.\n1.06 a distance to toxic .9 miles urban and 2.2 miles rural was obtained.  The new Town\nCreek Plant presently under construction is the only plant located in a rural area.\n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario for all chlorination processes involves tubing\nfailure, bad connection, or valve failure resulting in the release of 317 lbs of chlorine. \nWhen atmospheric dispersion modeling for this scenario was performed using the RMP*\ncomp Ver. 1.06 a distance to toxic endpoint of .1 miles urban or .1 miles rural was obtained.\n\nThe worst case release scenario for anhydrous ammonia involves a failure of a 10,000\npound tank yielding a cumulative release of 10,000 pounds of ammonia, when atmospheric\ndispersion modeling for this unlikely scenario was performed using the RMP* comp ver.\n1.06 a distance to toxic endpoint of .9 miles urban was obtained.\n\nThe alternative release (more likely) scenario was performed resulting in a release of 10\npounds/minute to a toxic endpoint of .1 miles.\n\nMacon Water Authority Risk Management Program includes the following key elements to\nmitigate the effects of potential chlorine release hazards:\n          \n            Operator Training\n  "
