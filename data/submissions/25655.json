      "SummaryText": "Oregon Cherry Growers is a processor of cherries in brine, which are further processed into maraschino and glace' cherry product.  The Sigland Receiving Station receives cherries for brining.  Sulfur Dioxide gas is bubbled into salt water to prepare brines that preserve, firm and bleach the cherries.  this prcess is essential to optimize uses for the growers' fruit and preserve cherry quality.  Our mission is to produce the highest quality cherry products in safe processing operations and protect our employees, our growers, our customers, the public, and the environment.\nTo assure that Sulfur Dioxide is handled safely, only trained qualified operators are authorized to make cherry brine.  Oregon cherry has a long standing safety program which included annual SO2 training for all brine making crews, Process Safety Management, meetings when a process change occurs, and continuing follow up to assure safe practices are followed and improved if possible.  Process safety team members assist in the annual update of our procedures and safety information.  We have had no reportable releases of Sulfur Dioxide at this facility in the last five years.\nOur hazard analysis shows our worst case scenario is loss of 8500 pounds, or all the contents of a cylinder in 10 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is 10 miles.  Potential population affected is 47,400.  The Most Likely(alternate) scenario is a leak in a cylinder valve where the quantity released is 20 pounds over 60 minutes.  The distance to endpoint is 0.2 mile, and the potential population affected is 57 people.\nTo assure accidental releases are prevented, Oregon Cherry Growers has a continuing safety program for Sulfur Dioxide.  All process procedures are written and closely monitored by trained qualified employees.  These include checklists for operations, regular equipment inspections, and maintaining a stringent training program to keep operators alert to safe operations.  Emergency Response activities are reviewed, drill"

Process Safety and Emergency Response training is also included in pre-harvest training activities.\nPlanned improvements include coordinated training with local emergency response agencies and applying the principles of continuous improvement to all chemical handling processes.  All improvements are documented and reviewed with the process team prior to implementation.\nDue to reductions in cherry inventories, this facility is scheduled for closure.   All Sulfur Dioxide inventory will be removed from the facility by Friday, May 3, 2002."
