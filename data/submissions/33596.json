      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex facility has a long-standing commitment to worker and public safety. \nThis commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as training \npersonnel and considering safety in the design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes.\nOur facility adheres to process safety policies, guidelines, and best practices that have been developed \nbased on company and industry experience over the years.  Our policy is to implement reasonable \ncontrols to prevent foreseeable releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our \ntrained personnel will respond to control and contain the incident.\n\nDESCRIPTION AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex is located at 150 West Warrenville Road, Naperville, Illinois 60563.  \nThe facility is owned by BP Corporation North America Inc.  The primary purpose of the facility is to conduct both\npetroleum and chemical research and development.  A secondary purpose is to provide office space for \na other BP employees unrelated to the research and development activities.  At present, the \nfacility has only one process -- the 300 Tank Farm -- which is subject to the Clean Air Act Risk \nManagement Planning requirements.  This process contains three flammable regulated substances \nwhich are in excess of the threshold quantity as follows:  propylene and ethylene.  The tank farm has \nan additional tank, formerly used to store an isobutylene mixture, which is currently out of service and has \nbeen filled with low pressure nitrogen.  Please note that the BP Naperville Complex has no regulated toxic substances in \nexcess of  the threshold quantity.\n\nHAZARD ASSESSMENTS\n\nWorst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst case scenario (WCS) for flammable substances is a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) with an \noverpressure endpoint of 1 pound per square inch (psi).  The WCS endpoint is based on the \ninstantaneous release of the "

Distances to the endpoint were calculated using the \nmethodology outlined in EPA?s RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance.  Nearby public receptors \ncould be affected by this type of release.  Specific information on this release is presented in more detail \nin this document.\n\nAlternative Release Scenarios \n\nThe alternative release scenario for flammable substances at the facility is a VCE resulting from the \nrelease of propylene through a relief valve at the 300 Tank Farm.  It is not anticipated that this release\nwould travel beyond property boundaries.  However, operators would still respond to the situation in a \ntimely manner. Specific information on this release is presented in more detail in the plan.\n\nPREVENTION PROGRAM\n\nThe following is a summary of the accident prevention program in place at the BP Naperville \nComplex for all EPA RMP covered processes, presently only the 300 Tank Farm.  Since this process is \nalso regulated by the OSHA PSM standard, this summary is organized in the format of the OSHA PSM \nelements.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex encourages employees who work at the 300 Tank Farm to participate \nin multiple facets of process safety management and accident prevention.  Examples of employee \nparticipation range from updating and compiling technical information to participating as a member of a \nprocess hazard analysis (PHA) team.  Employees have access to all information created as part of the \nfacility prevention program. Specific ways that employees can be involved are documented in the \nemployee participation plan.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe personnel at the 300 Tank Farm keep a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe\noperation.

This information is supplemented by\ndocuments that specifically address known exposure concerns and any known hazards associated with \nthe inadvertent mixing of chemicals.  The 300 Tank Farm has documented safety-related limits for \nspecific process parameters.  The 300 Tank Farm personnel help assure that the process is maintained \nwithin these limits using process controls and monitoring instruments, trained personnel, and protective \ninstrument systems.  In addition, information is available summarizing the consequences of deviation \nfrom these limits and the corrective actions to take.\n\nThe 300 Tank Farm also maintains technical documents that provide information about the design and \nconstruction of process equipment.  This information includes materials of construction, design pressure\n and temperature ratings, electrical ratings of equipment, piping and instrument drawings, etc.  This \ninformation, in combination with written procedures and trained personnel, provides a basis for \nestablishing inspection and maintenance activities, as well as for evaluating proposed process and \nfacility changes to ensure that safety features in the process are not compromised.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex has a program to help ensure that hazards associated with the\nvarious processes are identified and controlled.

HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic \nand thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who \nhave operating and maintenance experience as well as engineering expertise.  This team identifies and \nevaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures, and makes \nsuggestions for additional prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures\nare necessary.\n\nThe PHA team?s recommendations are forwarded to management for resolution.  These \nrecommendations are reviewed and all approved recommendations are tracked until they are completed.\nThe final resolution of each recommendation is documented and retained.   \n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly\nfrom the original design safety features, the BP Naperville Complex periodically updates and \nrevalidates the hazard analysis results.  These periodic reviews are conducted at least every five years \nas long as the process exists.  The recommendations from these updates are also forwarded to \nmanagement.

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected \npersonnel, form a system to help ensure that research and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\nTraining\n\nTo complement the written procedures for process operations, the BP Naperville Complex has \nimplemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  New \nemployees receive basic training in research and development  operations.  After successfully \ncompleting this training, a new operator is paired with a senior operator to learn process-specific duties \nand tasks.  After the new operator demonstrates (i.e. through tests, skills demonstration, etc.) adequate \nknowledge to perform the duties and tasks in a safe manner on their own, they can work independently.  \nIn addition, all operators periodically receive refresher training on the operating procedures to ensure \nthat their skills and knowledge are maintained at an acceptable level.

In addition, the BP\nNaperville Complex evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection \nof a contractor.  Facility personnel periodically monitor contractor performance to ensure that contractors\n are fulfilling their safety obligations.\n\nPre-Startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nThe BP Naperville Complex conducts a PSSR for any new facility or facility modification that\nrequires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of the PSSR is to ensure that safety\nfeatures, equipment, procedures, and personnel are appropriately prepared for startup prior to placing \nthe equipment into service.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in\naccordance with the design specifications and that all supporting systems are operationally ready.  The \nPSSR review team uses checklists to verify all aspects of readiness.

Valves to permit isolation of the process (manual or automated).\n2. Curbing or diking to contain liquid releases\n3. Redundant equipment and instrumentation (i.e. uninterruptible power supply for process control \n     system, backup firewater pump)\n4. Atmospheric relief devices\n\nRelease Mitigation\n\n1. Fire suppression and extinguishing systems \n2. Deluge systems for specific equipment\n3. Trained emergency response personnel\n4.
