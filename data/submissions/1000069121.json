      "SummaryText": "1. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\n\n\nLeprino Foods Company is strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety. This commitment is inherent in its comprehensive accidental release prevention program, which covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility. It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur, the facility will be evacuated and Mecosta County LEPC and the Remus Fire Department will be contacted for emergency response.\n\n\n\n2 The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\n\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass Cheese Manufacturing. The plant is located at 311 North Sheridan in Remus, Michigan.  We have one regulated substance, Ammonia, at our facility, which is used to provide refrigeration for the manufacturing of cheese.\n\n\n\n3 The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements set forth by the EPA under 40 CFR part 68. Only one of the processes at our facility are subject to the OSHA PSM standard under 29 CFR 1910.119. Our facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. Landview software was used to determine the population potentially affected if the WCS were actually to occur.\n\nThe following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nLeprino Foods Company maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes ar"

The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of (five years or when changes dictate). Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed in a timely manner.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Leprino Foods Company maintains written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround. The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nLeprino Foods Company has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with those processes. Refresher training is provided at least every three years and more frequently if needed. \n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nLeprino Foods Company carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment examined by these checks includes, among others, pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in a safe and timely manner. \n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Leprino Foods Company to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment and procedures. Process operators, maintenance personnel, or any other emplo"

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nLeprino Foods Company conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under the RMP rule are being implemented. These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions required as a result of the audits are undertaken in a safe and prompt manner.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nLeprino Foods Company promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident, as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. All reports are retained for a minimum of 5 years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nLeprino Foods Company truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort. Company employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accident prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard\n\nanalyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOn occasion, our company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, a thorough evaluation of the contractor's safety performance is carried out.  Leprino Foods Company has a strict policy of informing the contractors of know"

Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n\n\n4 Five-year Accident History\n\nThere have been no reportable accidents in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\n5 Emergency Response Plan\n\nLeprino Foods Company carries a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials. The plan addresses emergency actions, medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public.\n\nIn addition, the plan is promptly updated to reflect any pertinent changes taking place within our processes that would require a modified emergency response.  Mecosta County is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) with which our emergency plan has been coordinated and verified.\n\n\n\n6 Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nLeprino Foods Company expects to improve safety performance by continuing to work through action items from the most recent Mechanical Integrity Inspection and self audits that have taken place.  All recommendations during the inspection and audits t were designed to improve the safety performance of the ammonia refrigeration process as well as ensure facility employees work in a safe environment with no hazards.  The PSM/RMP team expects to evaulate each recommendation in a timely manner and implement, as soon as possible, those recommendations that will reduce the possibility of a release and/or mitigate the consequences of an unintentional release."
