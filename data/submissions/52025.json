The facility operates an ammonia refrigeration process and water chlorination delivery and storage processes and has several methods for ensuring employee and public safety associated with these processes.  The facility has developed procedures, plans and policies for the operation of these processes and for dealing with unexpected accidental releases.  MillerCoors has implemented a process safety management program for the ammonia refrigeration process that enhances safety by regular maintenance and inspections, hazard analysis, compliance audits, employee and contractor training, employee participation, ammonia monitoring/detection, and other activities.  Additionally, the facility has implemented an accident prevention program relative to the chlorine delivery and storage processes which includes process safety information, hazard analysis, operationg procedures, employee training, maintenance procedures, compliance auditing, and incident inverstigation.  MillerCoors has an Emergency Response Team that is trained for hazardous material response and additional training to include incipient fire response and confined space rescue.  MillerCoors also has emergency response procedures and plans to promote chemical safety in the event of an emergency situation.\n\nMillerCoors is engaged in the beer production business.  Due to the quantity of ammonia and chlorine maintained on site, the facility is subject to the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program regulations and the Risk Management Program regulations which are meant to promote safety at the facility and general public level.\n\nIn the previous five years, MillerCoors has not had any accidental releases that resulted in any deaths, injuries, or significant property on-site damage from the ammonia or chlorine processes.\n\nThe ammonia process at MillerCoors is "
