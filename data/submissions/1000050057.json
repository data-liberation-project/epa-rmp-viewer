The resources invested in the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous substances demonstrate this commitment. The Scranton Sewer Authority Wastewater Treatment Plant implements reasonable controls, such as training of personnel and the safe design, installation, operation and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to make every effort to prevent the release of hazardous substances.\n\n\n\n2.0 Description of The Scranton Sewer Authority Wastewater Treatment Plant and Regulated Substances\n\n\n\nThe Scranton Sewer Authority Wastewater Treatment Plant handles two substances regulated by the Risk Management Plan Rule (RMP Rule) in quantities above the Threshold Quantity. These substances are:\n\n\n\n* Chlorine - stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for chlorination of the water.\n\n* Sulfur dioxide- stored in 1 ton cylinders and used for sulfonation of water.\n\n\n\n3.0 Hazard Assessment\n\n\n\nThe RMP Rule requires The Scranton Sewer Authority Wastewater Treatment Plant to perform a Hazard Assessment of the regulated substances stored and used in the covered processes at the facility. This Hazard Assessment includes an offsite consequence analysis for the following scenarios:\n\n\n\n* One worst-case and one alternative release scenario for each of the toxic substances sulfur dioxide and chlorine used in the chlorination and sulfonation of effluent at the facility. The Scranton Sewer Authority Wastewater Treatment Plant completed a Hazard Assessment for the covered processes and the results have been appropriately communicated to the local emergency response agencies. The Hazard Assessment has been recently updated to reflect changes in population.\n\n\n\n4.0 Accidental Release Prevention Progr"
