Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Plicies\n\nThe City of Texas City (Texas City) is strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety. This commitment is demonstrated by Texas City's comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at its facillity. it is Texas City's policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of regulated substances. If such a release does occur unforeseeably, Texas City is completly coordinated with the Texas City Fire Department, which provides highly trained emergency responce personnel to control and mitigate the effects of the release.\n\n2. The stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nThe facility's primary activities encompass wastewater treatment. Texas City treatment plant falls within level 2 Risk Management Program requirements having one regulated substance present at its facility that exceeds the regulated quanity of 2500 pounds. This substance is chlorine and is used for disinfection of the wastewater. The maximum inventory of chlorine at the facility is 24,000 pounds.\n\n3. The general Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nTexas City has taken all the nesseary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requiements mandated under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA. The facility is also subject to EPCRA Section 302 notification requirements. The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at Texas City's stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nThe City of Texas City Utilities Department takes chemical safety and accident prevention very seriously.

These individuals share the commitment and responsibility to train the WWTP operators and maintenance personnel in the safe and proper handling of the chlorine and equipment, personal protective equipment, and safety procedures.  Chemical specific training is also provided during the training courses taken by the operators for their required State certifications.\n\nIn addition to training, the safety of our operations and maintenance staff is of paramount concern to the City of Texas City.  To those ends, policies and procedures are enforced to require a minimum of two operators being present when working around the chlorine cylinders in such a manner that an accidental release of the chlorine could occur (ie. changing out empty cylinders, performing maintenance on the chemical equipment, etc.).  All personnel working in such conditions are required to wear the appropriate personal protective equipment including self contained breathing apparatus and gloves.\n\nProtection of the community is another major concern for the City.  All chlorine cylinders and control equipment are housed in a masonry building which, in the event of an accidental release, could slow the migration of the chemical, thereby protecting our offsite customers as well as our onsite personnel.  Due to the fact that during the storage and handling of the chlorine the building may be open, it was not considered in impact calculations as a mitigating factor.  \n\nAir monitoring sensors are installed within the chlorine building which, via computer dial out programs, alert the facility operators, Police/Fire dispatchers, and supervisory personnel in the event of a chlorine release.  The sensitivity of the monitoring sensors is set at 3.0 ppm.  This low concentration sensitivity ensures quick activation of the emergency response system to any potentially h"

Weekly checks of the monitoring  and paging systems help assure all parties that the system is operational and will function in the event of an accidental release. \n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nTexas City conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with its processes are identified and controlled efficently. The methodology used to carry out these analyses includes a checklist based on the example presented by the EPA. The studies are undertaken by qualified personnel. Any findings related to the hazard analysis are addressed.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within its covered processes, Texas City has adopted written operating procedures. These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, and normal shutdown. The information is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nTexas City has a comprehensive program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes. Training is provided as frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nTexas City carries out maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations. Process equipment exanined by these checks includes, among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps. Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel who have previous training in maintenance practices, and are offered further specialized training as needed. Any equipment deficiencies identified by the maintenance checks are corrected in safe and timely manner.\n\nManagement of Change\n\nProcedures are in place at Texas city to manage changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, and procedures.

These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, and operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nIncidental Investigation\n\nTexas City promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in, a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. These investigations are undertaken to identify the situation leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccuring. All reports are retained for a minimum of five years.\n\nEmployee Participation\n\nTexas City truly believes process safety management and accidental prevention is a team effort. Employees are strongly encouraged to express their views concerning accidental prevention issues and to recommend improvements. In addition, Texas City's employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule.\n\nContractors  \n\nOn occasion, Texas City hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities. The facility has strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related to the contractor's work and the processes. Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response in the event of an accidental release of a regulated substance.\n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nTexas City has an excellent record of preventing accidental releases over the last five years. Due to the facility's stringent release-prevention policies, there have been no accidental releases during this period which fall within the guidlines set forth in 40 CFR 68.42(a).\n\n5.

As part of this coordination, the facility has a written community emergency response plan that address all aspects of emergency response, including adequate first aid and medical treatment, evacuations, and notification of local emergency response agencies and the public, as well as post-incident decontamination of effected areas.\n\nThe Wallace R. Knox WWTP is part of the Texas City-LaMarque LEPC Emergnency Response Plan.  In the event of an accidental release, the monitoring system within the chlorine building will alert the Police/Fire dispatchers who then notify the Texas City Fire Department's Haz Mat unit.  Ranking City officials are also alerted to the chemical release.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Fire Department's Haz Mat unit to contain, control and eliminate the cause of the chemical release.  The Fire Department also controls the scene and response levels to the chemical release.\n\nThe personnel of the WWTP are nonrespondants during such a major release and only provide technical support to the Fire Department Haz Mat unit as needed.\n\nWhen necessary and as indicated by the ranking fire official at the scene, the the community's public alert system would be activated to inform the citizens of the level of emergency and the steps that they should take to avoid injury.  Many forms of alerting the public are available to the City in the event of an emergency including audible sirens located around the city, the City's public access television station, and the City's radio station.  The sirens alert the residents to tune into the televsion or radio station for information concerning the emergency situation.\n\nPlanned Cahnges to Improve Safety\n\nThe City of Texas City has asked HDR/Claunch & Miller, the city's consulting engineer, to look at and propose an evaluation of improvements to the wastewater disinfection system.

The mitigation upgrade would include an emergency chlorine scrubber to the existing chlorine storage and feed building. The chlorine scrubber will be designed to vent a chlorine gas leak through a scrubber to neutralize the chlorine prior to venting to the atmosphere. In addition, the upgraded system would possibly have the use of emergency shutoff valves to automaticlly shut down the chlorine gas supply as soon as a leak is detected by the chlorine leak monitors. Chlorine gas regulators could be used on each 1-ton cylinder so that all of the chlorine supply piping inside the chlorine storage and feed building is under vacuum rather than pressure."
