The plant also uses sulfur dioxide in the disinfection process in quantities that exceed the threshold limit set by the USEPA.\nPROCESS DESCRIPTION\nThe Prairie Creek WWTP is located at 897 Treatment Plant Road in Lewisville, Texas.  The wastewater is treated at the plant, disinfected by chlorine and dechlorinated by using sulfur dioxide, and subsequently discharged.  \nThe existing chlorine feed facility at the Prairie Creek WWTP consists of a storage facility, two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves drip lines and filters to each, three manual feed chlorinators, and gas piping and ejectors.  Chlorine has a potential to generate a gaseous release in the chlorine storage area. The majority of the chlorine feed process operates through a water injection induced vacuum, making the system extremely safe and minimizing potential pressurized leaks along the feed lines.  \nThe existing sulfur dioxide feed facility at the Prairie Creek WWTP consists of an enclosed storage facility, two vacuum regulators mounted to an automatic switchover module with gas piping and miscellaneous valves drip lines and filters to each, three flow proportionate feed sulfunators, and gas piping and ejectors.  Sulfur dioxide has a potential to generate a gaseous release is the sulfur dioxide storage area. \nSulfur dioxide is stored as a pressurized liquid but is pressure fed as a gas from the containers.

      "SummaryText": "INTRODUCTION\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Program (ARPP) under Section 112(r) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and subsequently finalized the Accidental Release Prevention Risk Management Program rule (40 CFR Part 68).  This rule established the criteria of the Risk Management Plans (RMPs) required under the ARPP. 40 CFR Part 68 is similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u00bfs Process Safety Management Program, which is designed to protect workers from accidental releases of hazardous substances. In compliance with the Risk Management Program requirements, Lewisville submitted Risk Management Plans (RMP\u00bfs) to USEPA in June 1999 for its water and wastewater treatment facilities.\nThe regulations require that these RMPs be resubmitted within five years following the initial submission of the plans.  In addition, while the resubmission is to reflect a general update of all sections of the risk management plans, specific elements of each plan, the Offsite Consequence Analysis and the Hazard Assessment, must be redeveloped prior to resubmission of the plans. Additionally, the regulations require that if any facilities are modified through improvements that change equipment, controls, or amount of chemical in use onsite, the risk management plans must be updated to reflect the changes. \nEffective April 9, 2004, EPA issued Changes to the Chemical Accident Prevention Rule (Risk Management Program) in 2004  as amendments to the original RMP regulations which require the following changes to be made to RMP programs, prior to submission of the five year renewals of RMPs By June 21, 2004:\n1. Changes in the practices for RMPs requiring submission of information on reportable chemical accidents within six months following the event of that accident\n2. Changes in the practices for RMPs requiring the updating of emergency contacts information within 30 days of a change in that information\n3"

The addition of three additional pieces of information (data elements).\n\nThese changes have been incorporated into this Risk Management Plan update for the Prairie Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant for the city of Lewisville, Texas.\nThe Prairie Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) falls under this regulation because of the onsite storage of chlorine and sulfur dioxide.  The amounts of chlorine and sulfur dioxide stored exceed the threshold limits specified by the USEPA, thereby making the facility subject to compliance with the regulation.  The Prairie Creek WWTP personnel have complied with the USEPA Risk Management Program rule and have completed a RMP contains the following required information:\n? A management system (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart A);\n? A hazard assessment that establishes the worst-case and alternative release scenarios and their impacts on the population and the environment (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart B);\n? A prevention program that includes safety information, a hazard review, operating procedures, training, maintenance, compliance audits, and incident investigations (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart C); and\n? An emergency response plan (40 CFR Part 68 Subpart E).\nThe following subsections discuss details of the plan that has been implemented at the Prairie Creek WWTP.\nRELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\nThe Prairie Creek WWTP facility in Lewisville Texas, has an excellent record in preventing and minimizing releases of chlorine.  The emergency response policies at this facility ensure that there is emergency response coverage 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Adequate provisions have been implemented to coordinate response activities with outside agencies, such as the City of Lewisville Fire Department in case of an emergency.

The USEPA requires that a single worst-case release scenario for the facility and one alternative release scenario for each regulated chemical be reported. \nWorst-Case Release Scenario\nA worst case release scenario was developed for this update.  However, in accordance with guidance from EPA\u00bfs April 9, 2004 regulation modification to 2004 RMP updates, this information is intentionally omitted from this Executive Summary.\n \nAlternative Release Scenario\nAn alternative release scenario was developed for this update.  However, in accordance with guidance from EPA\u00bfs April 9, 2004 regulation modification to 2004 RMP updates, this information is intentionally omitted from this Executive Summary.\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM\nThe Prairie Creek WWTP carries out consistent operation and maintenance of its chlorine equipment utilizing only fully trained personnel in this area.  Prairie Creek WWTP management enforces consistent operation through discipline for operational deviations.\n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\nThe accident history for the Prairie Creek WWTP was reviewed for a period from June 1999, through June 2004.  During this period of time, no accidental releases of chlorine had occurred.  \n\nNew policies have been developed by the city of Lewisville that will cause a resubmission of the RMP within six months of the occurrence of a reportable chlorine release.\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\nThe City of Lewisville has developed an Emergency Response Program in which plant employees are divided into various management and response teams.  Back-up personnel are available in the event that the primary response personnel cannot be contacted. \n\nThe Emergency Response Plan includes: (1) procedures to follow in the event of a chlorine emer"
