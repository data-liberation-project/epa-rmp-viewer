The facility is designed to distribute and store the following LP-gases: propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, isobutylene(2 methylpropene), and butylene (Butene). The primary purpose of the facility is to repackage and distribute LP-gases to both retail and wholesale customers for use as a fuel.\r\n\r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act applies to the Airgas Specialty Gases facility because the facility handles and stores the following RMP-regulated flammable gases: propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, 2 methylpropene, and butene in excess of threshold quantities. Two requirements of this section specifically apply to operations at the plant:\r\n\r\n1.\tA\u00a7A\u00a7112(r)(1)  Purpose and General Duty Clause: The essence of the general duty clause is that an owner/operator that stores and uses hazardous chemicals in any quantity has a fundamental obligation to ensure a safe operation and to have plans in place in the event of an accident to appropriately manage the situation. Airgas Specialty Gases is committed to ensuring the safe operation of its LP-gas distribution and storage facility, as well as all of its other operations, to ensure a safe workplace for our employees and a safe location for our neighbors in the community. Airgas Specialty Gases, therefore, has procedures in place to prevent accidents and is committed to emergency preparedness both for our facility and community-wide by coordinating with the local Fire Department.\r\n\r\n2.\tRisk Management Plan:  The Airgas Specialty Gases LP-gas distribution and storage facility handles and stores propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, 2 methylpropene, and butene in excess of thresholds specified in A\u00a7112(r). Even prior to the promulgation of A\u00a7112(r), Airgas Specialty Gases management has been very aware of the potential hazards posed by the handling and storag"

These programs are documented and described in this Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the RMP definition for a process, the LP-gas distribution and storage facility is defined as one process consisting of ten tanks that are interconnected or that can be interconnected at any one time. Tanks #1 and #10 hold propane; Tanks #2 & 3 (out of service) and #9 holds butane; Tank #4 holds isobutane; Tank #6 holds butene;  Tanks #7 Isobutane, #8 holds 2 methylpropene; and Tank #5 propylene.\r\n\r\nAirgas Specialty Gases has implemented safety precautions and procedures designed to prevent and mitigate catastrophic releases. Airgas Specialty Gases has coordinated with local emergency responders including the Pearland Volunteer Fire Department and the Brazoria Emergency Planning Committee.\r\n\r\nAirgas Specialty Gases management is committed to the following:\r\n\r\no Preventing accidents;\r\n\r\no Training our employees in correct procedures in the event of an accident;\r\n\r\no Participating in community emergency preparedness;\r\n\r\no Addressing any citizen concerns by fully explaining potential hazards associated with Airgas Specialty Gases operations and all steps being taken to prevent and mitigate accidents; and\r\n\r\no Being a good corporate citizen of Brazoria County.\r\n\r\nWith these objectives in mind, this Risk Management Plan has been developed to provide information about our management of the risks associated with the LP-gas process. Most important, Airgas Specialty Gases stresses its commitment to ensuring a safe operation for its employees, its visitors, and its community.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above Clean Air Act requirements, Airgas Specialty Gases is in compliance with the OSHA PSM, ECRA, and the Department of Transportation Texas Railroad Commission NFPA 58 requirements.

As a result of the PHA study (conducted using the Hazard and Operability or HAZOP method), in order to avoid an accidental release due to a pull away during loading/unloading operations, Airgas Specialty Gases has revised the loading and unloading operating procedures to require that chock blocks be placed at the tires on the passenger side of the cargo tank vehicles. This would ensure that the operator or driver walks around the vehicle to check before driving away. Additionally, in order to prevent overfilling, the procedures were revised to ensure that the operator or the driver stays by the cargo tank vehicle and/or the storage tank during the entire transfer operation to monitor the gauges during filling.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Airgas Specialty Gases will be installing passive and remote shutdown systems on cargo tank vehicles at the next scheduled pressure test, as required by DOT.\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements that Airgas Specialty Gases will be implementing before the end of 2005 include the following:\r\n\r\n* Additional reviews and revisions to operating procedures to ensure continued safe operations.\r\n* Documentation of all preventative maintenance and inspections that are being done and addition of requirements to address tank rust issues.\r\n* Review and improve incident investigation system. \r\n* Review and improve training program.\r\n\r\n1.0 \tINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Airgas Specialty Gases LP-gas distribution and storage facility is designed to distribute LP-gas to retail and wholesale customers.

Of special relevance to the development of Airgas specialty Gases Risk Management Plan are the following subsections of A\u00a7112(r):\r\n\r\no A\u00a7112(r)(1)  Purpose and general Duty Clause. This clause is self-enacting and went into effect on November 15, 1990.\r\no A\u00a7112(r)(3-5)  Requirements for the listing of the regulated substances and the determination of threshold quantities. These sections were promulgated in January 1994.\r\no A\u00a7112(r)(6)  This section required the establishment of the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, which has broad advisory and accident investigation powers similar to those of the National Transportation Safety Board. \r\no A\u00a7112(r)(7)  Requirements for affected facilities to develop and submit Risk Management Plans. This section was promulgated in June 1996.\r\n\r\nSection 112(r) of the Clean Air Act, also known as the Risk Management Program rule, required that affected sources submit Risk Management Plans (RMPs) and associated off-site consequence analyses by June 21, 1999. To assist the regulated industry in meeting the submittal requirements, the EPA provided written guidance, including the document, Risk Management Program Guidance for Offsite Consequence Analysis (RMP Guidance for OCA), as well as the RMP*Comp software program to help model worst case and alternative release scenarios. Airgas Specialty Gases followed this guidance in the preparation of its Risk Management Plan.\r\n\r\nThe RMP rule also required that owners of operators of facilities with  processes subject to the RMP rule review and update their RMPs at least every 5 years, or sooner under certain circumstances. The first update for facilities that submitted their original RMP on or before June 21, 1999, and who have not submitted an update since, are jue on June 21, 2004.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, EPA amended the RMP rule on April 9, 2004. The rule amendments include the following revised requirements:\r\n\r\n(1)\tInformation on any reportabl"

This includes correcting information in Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the RMP plan, which covers the five-year accident history and the incident investigation information that is part of the Prevention Program. The incident \r\ninvestigation information should include the date of investigation and the expected date of completion of changes due to the accident investigation. Previously, information on reportable accidents did not have to be reported until the next 5-year update.\r\n(2) \tChanges to emergency contact information must be corrected, and a corrected RMP plan submitted, within one month.\r\n(3) \tIn view of security concerns, the previous requirement that a brief description of the off-site consequence analysis (OCA) be included in the RMP executive summary has been removed. Whereas the analyses are still required, facilities no longer have to include information about the analysis of the potential off-site consequences of hypothetical worst-case and alternative accidental releases in the executive summary. However, specific data elements from the OCA will continue to be required in other sections of the RMP submittal.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the revised rule added the following three data elements to the RMO update submittals:\r\n\r\n(1)\tEmergency contact e-mail address;\r\n(2)\tThe purpose and type of any submission that revises or otherwise affects previously filed RMPs; and\r\n(3)\tThe name, address, and telephone number of the contractor/consultant who prepared the RMP.\r\n\r\nAirgas Specialty Gases update includes the additional information that \r\nis being required by the most recent rule amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.1\tAPPLICABILITY\r\n\r\nAirgas Specialty Gases conducted a review of all the processes at the LP-gas distribution and storage facility to determine the applicability of A\u00a7112(r) program requirements.
