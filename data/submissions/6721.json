The alternative release scenario is one that is more likely to occur than the worst case release scenario.\n\nEPA's Risk Management Program Guidance for Ammonia Refrigeration (November 1998) and the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration's (IIAR) Risk Management Guidelines (1998) were the primary documents used to develop the alternative release scenario.  \n\nThe alternative release scenario must meet two criteria:\n\n1.\tMust be more likely to occur than the worst case scenario, and\n\n2.\tMust reach an endpoint off site, unless no such criteria exist.\n\nAccording to EPA's guidance, the meteorological defaults to be used in the alternative analysis (unless other data is available) are a wind speed of 3 meters per second and an Atmospheric Stability Class of D.\n\nIn determining the alternative release, the 5-year accident history and failure scenarios identified in the hazard review must be considered.  There has been no RMP reportable release in the past five years. \n\nA more likely alternative release scenario would be the lifting of a relief valve.  A relief valve will lift in the event of an overpressurization of the system to relieve pressure.  The capacities of the facility's refrigeration system relief valves range from 30.9 to 138 pounds ammonia per minute.  The average value of the relief valves is 50 pounds per minute.  Many of the valves are located inside the building, therefore, the building would serve to attenuate the release to the outside atmosphere in many instances.  Building attenuation cannot be considered, however, if the release occurs near an open door or window or outside.  For the alternate release scenario, it was assumed that a relief valve lifts either outside or near an open door or window.  A relief rate of 50 pounds per minute"

Because the facility has installed ammonia sensors throughout the cooler area and in the compressor room, it was assumed that a release would last only 10 minutes, which is EPA's default for most of its release scenarios.  Therefore, the total release to the atmosphere is assumed to be 500 pounds (50 pounds per minute X 10 minutes).\n\nThe toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  Based Exhibit 4-5 in EPA's guidance, with a release rate of 50 pounds per minute, the distance to the toxic endpoint is 0.10 miles with either urban or rural topography.\n\n\n3.2 RESIDENTIAL POPULATION WITHIN ENDPOINT RADIUS (40 CFR 68.30)\n\nThe residential population within the distance to the endpoint for the alternative release analysis.

By June 21, 1999, covered processes are required to meet the requirements of one of three program categories (Program 1, 2, or 3) based upon:\n\n\n7 The potential for off-site consequences associated with a worst-case accidental release;\n7 The facility's accidental release history;\n7 The applicability of OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard prevention requirements to the facility;\n7 The status of the facility's coordination of emergency response with the local emergency response agencies; and\n7 The facility's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code.\n\nProcesses that have little or no potential impact on the public in the event of an accidental release are required to comply with Program 1.  Processes that have the highest potential for impact on the public will be required to comply with Program 3.  All other processes are required to comply with Program 2.\n\nCovered facilities must develop and implement a Risk Management Program (RMP) consisting of the following four elements:\n\n7 Hazard Assessment - Impact of possible releases to the surrounding community;\n\n7 Prevention Program - Written procedures in place to prevent releases;\n\n7 Management Program - A plan to ensure that the RMP is implemented; and\n\n7 Emergency Response Program - A plan of action to respond to a release.\n\nTogether these four components constitute the RMP.  The RMP Plan that must be submitted electronically to EPA by June 21, 1999, must contain a summary of these four main components along with a certification that the information submitted is true, accurate and complete.  A hard copy of the RMP Plan to be submitted to the EPA is included in Exhibit A.\n\n\n1.2 APPLICABILITY OF RMP RULE TO FACILITY\n\nThe Ryan Foods Company, Jacksonville, Florida facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7) as a refrigerant to maintain the proper temperature of milk, and non-dairy products within the facility.\nAnhydrous ammonia is identified on the List"

The refrigeration system at the facility meets this requirement so therefore the entire refrigeration system is subject to the RMP rule.\n\n\n\n1.3 DEFINING PROCESS\n\nThe EPA RMP Rule defines a process as any activity involving a regulated substance including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement of such substances, or a combination of these activities.  For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release, shall be considered a single process.\nBecause the refrigeration system holds greater than 10,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia, the entire refrigeration system, including the receiver, evaporators, compressors, piping, and valves, is considered part of the covered process. The refrigeration system consists of approximately 30 pieces of equipment.\n\n\n\n1.4 PROGRAM LEVEL\nIn order to be eligible for Program 1, the process must meet two basic criteria:\n\n\n\n7 There must be no public receptors within the distance to an endpoint from the worst-case release scenario; and\n\n7 No accidental release of ammonia can have caused off-site deaths, injuries, or response or restoration activities for an environmental receptor.\n\nThe worst case release analysis (see Section 2.2) involves public receptors, and therefore, the process is not eligible for Program 1.  The process is subject to OSHA's Process Safety Management Program (PSM) , and therefore, it is not eligible for Program 2.  The process is not eligible for Program 1, nor is it eligible for Program 2 because it is subject to PSM. Therefore it is subject to Program 3.\n\n\n1.5 REGISTRATION INFORMATION\n\nMost of the information provided in the Registration Section of the RMP Plan submitted to the EPA (see Exhibit A) was provided by the fa"

The worst case release is one that is unlikely to occur.  The purpose of the worst case release analysis is to support a dialogue with the community on release prevention. It is a conservative analysis and is not to serve as a rational basis for actual emergency response planning.\n\n\nThe worst case release scenario is defined under 40 Code of Regulations (CFR) 68.25 as the release of the largest quantity of ammonia from a vessel or process line failure that results in the greatest distance to a toxic endpoint.

      "SummaryText": "se scenario for the refrigeration process is assumed to be a case where the total quantity of ammonia in the high pressure receiver is released.  The receiver is located in an area on the front (north - east) side of the facility.  The receiver is capable of holding 6,096 pounds of ammonia when at 100% capacity (the greatest amount that would ever be placed in the receiver).  There are no passive mitigation systems (dikes, berms, drains, sumps or enclosures) considered in the analysis because the receiver is located outdoors.\n\n\nAccording to the IIAR Guidance (Chapter 4, page 4-8), the release should be reported as a gas because ammonia is normally a gas at ambient temperature and is handled as a gas liquified under pressure.  According to EPA's Guidance (Chapter 4, page 4-6), the release rate, where no passive mitigation is assumed, is calculated by dividing the total quantity released by 10 minutes.  In this case the release rate is 6096/10 or 609 pounds per minute.\n\n\nThe meteorological defaults to be used (unless other data is available) are a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and an Atmospheric Stability Class of F.\n\n\nAccording to Appendix A to 40 CFR 68.22, and EPA's guidance, the toxic endpoint used for this scenario must be where the ambient concentration of ammonia is 0.14 mg/L or less.  This endpoint is a concentration below which nearly all individuals could be exposed to for one hour without serious health effects.  Based Exhibit 4-4 in EPA's guidance, with a release rate of 600 pound per minute (rounded 609 to nearest value on the table), and an urban topography, the distance to the toxic endpoint is .90 miles.\n\n\n2.2 RESIDENTIAL POPULATION WITHIN ENDPOINT RADIUS (40 CFR 68.30)\n\nThe facility is located in an urban area surrounded primarily by residential area. There are a few commercial establishments located within the toxic end point. There is also an Elementary school within this area. The population within this area is aproxamently 7448 persons."
