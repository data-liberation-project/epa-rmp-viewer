Other industrial gases may also be received in cylinders, stored on site, and shipped to customers.  The facility has determined that the quantity of acetylene may reach the regulatory threshold under RMP.  The facility also covers this material under its Process Safety Management (PSM) program. \r\n\r\nAirgas National Welders conducts its operations to prevent possible releases or harm to its products, employees and to the surrounding area and residents.  Airgas National Welders implements many Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the acetylene process and the safe handling of compressed gas cylinders to prevent any accidental release.  Along with written standard operating procedures, several administrative controls are used.  These include, operator training, emergency procedures, qualification of operators, and inventory control.  \r\n\r\nThe company uses Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) as the foundation of the chemical prevention program.  The PHA systematically examines the equipment, systems and procedures for handling regulated materials in order to identify the hazards that exist and how to control them.  The PHA included a team review of the process using the HAZOP and \r\nWhat-If methodologies to identify hazards, review of any previous incidents, verification of controls and the consequences of their failure, review of issues related to sitting and human factors and a qualitative evaluation of failures of control.\r\n\r\nThe Airgas National Welders facility in Goldsboro, NC has not had an acetylene release related accident within the past 5 years.\r\n\r\nImplementation of PSM/RMP produced improvements to the process. Refer to PSM/RMP corrective action logs. At this time there are no additional changes planned.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAirgas National Welders has a written Emergency Action Pla"
