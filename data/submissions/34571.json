The facility was formerly known as Specified Fuels.  \n\n1.  Accidental release prevention and emergency response policies:\n\nHaltermann's prevention policy is that we will strive to prevent any uncontrolled release of hazardous chemical from this site.  Haltermann is subject to OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) and EPA Risk Management Plan regulations.  These legislations were enacted to prevent accidental releases of certain flammable and toxic chemicals.  Haltermann goes beyond the requirements of the law and works to prevent accidental releases of all chemicals.\n\nHaltermann's emergency response policy is to respond as quickly as possible with adequate resources to stop the incident from spreading.  No secrets will be held from the public.  The response plan includes notification of local authorities and any potentially affected neighbors.\n\n2.  The stationary source and regulated substances handled.\n\nHaltermann Products provides gasoline and diesel fuels to test vehicle engines.  Many of these chemicals are very flammable. \n\nChemicals are received and shipped by drum, tank truck, rail car and barge.  Access to the site is restricted to company employees, authorized customers and designated contractors.\n\nThe RMP chemicals currently handled at Haltermann Products:\n\n- Isobutane\n- Butane\n- Isopentane\n- Propane\n- Penatane\n\nThere are several flammable chemicals that Haltermann is filing with the EPA on a predictive basis.  Haltermann has handled some of these chemicals in the past and there is a remote chance of handling them in the future.  These flammable chemicals include:\n\n- 1,3-Pentadiene\n- 2-Butene\n- 2-Butene-trans\n- 1,3-Butadiene\n- 2-Butene-cis\n- 1-Butene\n- 2,2-Dimethylpropane\n- 2-Methyl-1-butene\n- 1-Pentene\n- 2-Methyl-1-propene\n- 2-Pentene, (E)-\n- 2-Pentene, (Z)-\n- 3-Methyl-1-butene\n- Acetaldehyde\n- Butene\n- Isoprene\n-"

Five-year accident history.\n\nHaltermann has had no reportable accidents involving the regulated chemicals in the past five years.  \n\n6.  The emergency response program.\n\nHaltermann's emergency response program is based upon compliance with five government agencies (EPA, OSHA, Texas General Land Office, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and Coast Guard) rules and regulations.  \n\nHaltermann has an extensive Emergency Response Plan manual that details steps to be taken should any foreseeable emergency situation arise.\n\nSmall incidents can be handled internally by our Emergency Response Team. Our team is highly trained in fire fighting and spill/leak response techniques.\n\nIf the emergency is too large for our Emergency Response Team, Haltermann can call for assistance from the Channelview Fire Department.                                                                                               \n\nHaltermann has procedures to notify the public and various government agencies in the event of an emergency that might get past the fence-line.  Procedures are also in place to help the public recover from an incident caused by a release from our plant.\n\nHaltermann is an active member of the North Channel Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The Channelview Fire Department visits the site usually once a year.  \n\n\n7.  Planned changes to improve safety.\n\nHaltermann is continuously improving its Process Safety and Emergency Response programs as knowledge is gained through audits, training, drills and industry experiences. \n\nHaltermann plans on installing gas release sensors around the tanks that hold RMP chemicals."

The worst-case release scenario(s) and the alternate release scenario(s), including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario.\n\nNOTE: If additional information is needed on the scenarios below please contact Haltermann at 832-376-2208 or 281-452-5951.\n\nToxic Worse Case Scenario\n\nHaltermann Products does not handle any RMP Toxic chemicals.\n\nFlammable Worst Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario (WCS) is a total failure of a 52,000 pound storage tank that holds isobutane.  The material explodes.  The explosion will mainly effect Haltermann's industrial neighbors.\n\nToxic Alternate Release Scenarios\n\nHaltermann Products does not handle any RMP Toxic chemicals.\n\nFlammable Alternate Release Scenario\n\nThe Flammable Alternate Release Scenario (ARS) is a 7,500 pound leak of Isobutane that vaporizes and explodes.  This release will only effect Haltermann's closest industrial neighbors.  \n\n4.  The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\nHaltermann's prevention program is in compliance with OSHA Process Safety Management, 29 CFR 1910.119 and the EPA's Risk Management Program.   \n\nHaltermann prevents releases by designing processes to handle chemicals safely.  \n\nWe conduct safety reviews on the processes to ensure they are capable of handling chemicals safely.  \n\nWe have documented operating procedures for operating and our equipment safely.  \n\nWe maintain our equipment so it operates safely.  \n\nWe inspect our equipment so it does not degrade over time.   \n\nWe train our personnel to operate and maintain our equipment in a safe and proper manner.  \n\nWe randomly test all our employees for drugs and alcohol.
