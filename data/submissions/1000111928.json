It is WVC policy to provide the safest workplace possible for our employees while also minimizing to the fullest extent practical any impact on the neighboring community, which includes striving to eliminate accidental releases.  This commitment is demonstrated by the resources invested in accident prevention, such as emphasizing safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes; providing proper training to personnel; having up-to-date operating procedures; and implementing an effective maintenance and mechanical integrity program.  Our policy is to implement appropriate controls to minimize the potential for releases of regulated substances.  However, if a release does occur, our trained personnel will respond to control and contain the release in order to minimize to the fullest extent any possible impact on the neighboring community.\n\n(b) Stationary Source and Regulated Substances Handled \n\nThe WVC facility is located at the intersection of Louisiana Highways 73 and 30 in Geismar, LA The facility includes three production units: a vinyl chloride (including ethylene dichloride) unit,  a polyvinyl chloride unit , and a chlor-alkali (chlorine and caustic) unit. WVC uses or produces the following RMP regulated substances in quantities above the threshold quantities listed in 40 CFR 68.130:\n\nToxics:  chlorine and hydrogen chloride\nFlammables:  propylene and vinyl chloride\n\n(c) Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe processes at the facility regulated by the EPA RMP regulation are also subject to the OSHA PSM rule.  As a result, WVC has developed procedures to prevent the accidental release of highly hazardous chemicals at facility"

Collectively, these procedures help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by equipment failures and/or human errors.  In addition to the procedures developed to comply with the PSM rule, WVC has safety features to help (1) contain/control a release, (2) quickly detect a release, and (3) reduce the consequences of (mitigate) a release. \n\n(d) Five-year Accident History\n\nWVC has not had an incident that meets the RMP criteria for reporting in the past five years.  \n\n(e) Emergency Response Program\n\nWVC's Geismar facility maintains a written emergency response program to protect workers and public safety as well as the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated substance, including the possibility of a fire or explosion if a flammable substance is accidentally released.  The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, the plant has procedures that address maintenance, inspection and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is reviewed annually and updated when necessary based on modifications made to plant processes or other plant facilities.  Emergency response program changes are administered such that informing and/or training affected personnel is accomplished prior to implementation of the change.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the Geismar facility is coordinated with the Geismar Area Mutual Aid (GAMA) network which is"

This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The Geismar facility has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire department).  This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response.  In addition to periodic GAMA meetings, the Geismar facility conducts periodic emergency drills. \n\n(f) Planned Changes to Improve Safety \n\nWVC is actively working toward obtaining OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star status.    According to OSHA, approval into VPP is OSHA\u0092s official recognition of the outstanding efforts of employers and employees who have achieved exemplary occupational safety and health.  \n\nIn additional to pursuing VPP Star status, WVC will continue to evaluate the systems and programs in place and make necessary improvements and adjustments to ensure a well-functioning, effective process safety/ risk management program."
