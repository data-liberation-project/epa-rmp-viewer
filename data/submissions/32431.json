The accidental release prevention and emergency policies.\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies two raw materials utilized by the James Austin Company as hazardous; chlorine and ammonium hydroxide.\r\n\r\nThe management of the James Austin Company is cognizant of the risks such chemicals pose to its employees and the community.  Austin?s management is committed to ensuring that its employees adhere to safety and accident prevention procedures when handling all chemicals.\r\n\r\nSensors provide early warning of minute leaks of chlorine and are linked to the facility?s alarm system.  Once detected, automatic shut off valves close quickly to seal off a leak.  Alarms are also in place to automatically signal emergency personnel and evacuate the facility in the event of a potentially serious leak.  Evacuation routes are clearly marked and periodic drills are conducted.  Sensors, alarms, and other emergency equipment is checked for proper functioning.  Defective emergency equipment is fixed or replaced promptly.\r\n\r\nAll employees who handle chlorine and ammonium hydroxide must complete specialized in-house training prior to assuming such responsibilities.  These employees are also sent annually for additional outside training sponsored by our chemical suppliers, they also receive the Hazmat Technician Refresher Training, enabling the establishment of an on-site emergency response team.\r\n\r\nLocal Fire Departments are invited annually for a tour of the plant.  Many of the local departments attend each year.  They are appraised of any significant changes in equipment, chemicals or processes that may assist in an emergency response.  The company also solicits their input on ways to improve the safety of our facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n2).

Such as; bleach, ammonia, dish soaps, fabric softeners, laundry detergents, window cleaners, etc.  Most of these products are produced by dilution and/or blending of concentrated raw materials.  Of these products, the bleach and ammonia will be discussed.  These are the chemicals on site, which the EPA considers to be hazardous materials.\r\n\r\nThe raw materials used to produce these products are shipped to our facility by drum, tank truck and rail car.\r\n\r\nThe finished household ammonia is produced by a 29.4% ammonium hydroxide solution, which is a regulated substance.  It is shipped in by tank truck and unloaded into a storage tank.   The maximum amount of the 29.4% ammonium hydroxide that can be stored is 98,280 pounds.  A measuring level meter in the 29.4% ammonium hydroxide tank enables us to determine the exact amount being delivered and the amount in the tank at all times.   When production of the household ammonia is needed, the 29.4% ammonium hydroxide is metered and diluted into another tank.\r\n\r\nThe offloading of chlorine from a rail car produces the finished household bleach.  Chlorine is a regulated substance.  The maximum amount of chlorine that can be stored on the rail siding is 720,000 pounds.  The chlorine is metered through continuous bleach making process unit with a solution of water and sodium hydroxide that are also being metered to produce finished household strength bleach.   The sensors metering these raw materials open and close valves accordingly to keep a constant strength.   Samples are taken from the continuous bleach making process during this time to ensure the proper strength.  Samples are also taken from the finished tank to once again check product quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n3).  The worst-case scenario and the alternative release scenario.\r\n\r\nA worst-case scenario involves the release of the entire contents of a chlorine rail car.  Chlorine would be released at the rate of 18,000"

A distance of 6 miles would be affected and approximately 64,000 people would need to be notified and/or evacuated.   These figures were determined by the use of ALOHA 5.3.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for chlorine is a leak in the pipe.  When the chlorine starts to leak, the sensors detect the chlorine and send a signal to shut the 2 automatic shut off valves in the line preventing any further chlorine from entering the system.  The chlorine car will need to be shut off manually.  The release duration is 60 minutes with 168 lb./min being released.  The total quantity released in the amount of time is 8485 pounds.  The distance affected is 1.5 miles with approximately 10,000 residents in the area.  These figures were determined by the use of LOHA 5.3.  The automatic shut off valves can only reopen once the alarm has been cleared.\r\n\r\nThe alternative scenario for the 29.4% ammonium hydroxide is a leak in the pipe.  The tank sits in a concrete dike area limiting the surface area of the leak.  10-minute release duration will release a quantity of 6730 pounds at a rate of 673 lb./min.  The distance affected is 0.14 mile with approximately 70 residents in the area.  These figures were determined by the use of aloha 5.3.\r\n\r\n\r\n4).  The general accidental release prevention program and chemical-specific prevention steps.\r\n\r\nThere are several regulations which aide as preventive measures in reducing the risk of injury or a release that James Austin Company must comply.\r\n\r\nOne of these regulations is the Process Safety Management Standard of highly hazardous chemicals, Title 29 CFR 1910.119.  This standard is to prevent unwanted releases that could expose employees and others to serious hazards.  The standard covers the hazards of the chemicals used in the process, technology of the process, equipment in the process and employee involvement.  Another regulation is the Department of Transportation 49 C"

This includes the checking of valves, making sure of a secure hook up seal, scrubbing chlorine lines when finished and meters are calibrated.\r\n\r\nThe continuous bleach making process has numerous high and low level alarm settings that will automatically close valves if the alarm is reached.  The chlorine rail car is equipped with a Unipro automatic valve shut off system.   If the chlorine car is moved, loss of air pressure, loss of electric or the chlorine sensors detect chlorine, the Unipro automatic valves will close.  \r\n \r\nA chlorine air monitoring system is constantly monitoring the air inside the building and at each rail car.  Upon the detection of chlorine, the alarm will signal either a first or second alarm depending on the amount detected.  Either alarm will close the automatic shut off valves at the rail car.  First alarm is a warning, second alarm employees must evacuate the building and the proper personnel on site will respond. Also in second alarm, the outside monitoring company will call the facility for a clear code.  If no answer or proper clear code given, they will dispatch emergency response crews.\r\n\r\nThe hooking up and disconnection of a chlorine rail car is a 3-person must operation.
