      "SummaryText": "This is to inform all interested persons, including employees that the Pilgrims Pride Athens, GA Poultry Processing Facility is complying with OSHA's Process Safety Management Standard (called Process Safety Management or PSM), Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.119, and EPA's Risk Management Program regulations (called RM Program), Title 40 CFR Part 68, to deal with the risks involved with the storage, handling, and processing of hazardous chemicals.  In this way we promote overall plant, employee and public safety.\n\nThese programs enable our facility to prevent the occurrence, and minimize the consequences, of significant releases of toxic substances as well as fires, explosions, and other types of catastrophic accidents.  Overall, these programs prevent accidental fatalities, injuries and illnesses and avoid physical property damage.\n\nOur safety programs are applied to any activity involving hazardous chemicals including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or the on-site movement of such chemicals, or combination of these activities. This facility has two refrigeration systems using anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant.  The amount of anhydrous ammonia contained in each system is above the EPA threshold reporting quantity required to comply with the RM Program standards.  \n\nPilgrim's Pride is committed to the safety of its employees and the surrounding community.  This commitment includes both human health and the protection of the environment.  Safety is ensured through careful preventive measures and emergency planning.  The intent of our release prevention policy is to minimize all potential risks that could possibly lead to an accidental ammonia release.  This program focuses primarily on the safe operation and the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.   Our safety programs help to prevent accidents because they focus on the rules, procedures, and practices which govern individual processes, activities, or pieces of equipment.  Th"
