We use a combination of accidental release prevention programs and emergency response planning programs to help ensure the safety of our employees and the public as well as protection of the environment.  This document provides a brief overview of the comprehensive risk management activities that we have designed and implemented, including:\n\n *  A description of our facility and use of substances regulated by EPA's RMP regulation\n *  Results from our assessment of the potential offsite consequences from accidental chemical releases (not contained within the Executive Summary)\n *  An overview of our accidental release prevention programs\n *  A five-year accident history for accidental releases of chemicals regulated by EPA's RMP rule\n *  An overview of our emergency response program\n *  Certifications that EPA's RMP rule requires us to provide\n *  Detailed information (called data elements) about our risk management program\n\nSTATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES\n\nOur facility produces Lubricants,  Specialty Solvents, and Gasoline using a variety of chemicals and processing operations.  The Lubricant and Specialty Product division includes a refinery which consists of a Crude Unit, Platformer, ROSE Unit, Extraction Unit, MEK Unit, Bulk Loading and Tank Farm.  In our ROSE and MEK processes, the following RMP-regulated flammable chemicals (including quantities handled/stored) have been identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequences in the event of a substantial accidental release:\n\nMEK UNIT - propane is stored in D-23  vessel (80,700 lbs) at MEK.\nPropane is used for chilling the products charged at the MEK Unit for dewaxing.\n\n"

Our management systems address each of the key features of successful prevention programs including:\n\n *  Process safety information\n *  Process hazard analysis\n *  Operating procedures\n *  Training\n *  Mechanical integrity\n *  Management of change\n *  Pre-startup review\n *  Compliance audits\n *  Incident investigation\n *  Employee participation\n *  Hot work permit\n *  Contractors\n *  Emergency Planning & Response\n\nThese individual elements of our prevention program work together to prevent accidental chemical releases.  Our company and our employees are committed to the standard that these management systems set for the way we do business, and we have specific accountabilities and controls to ensure that we are meeting our own high standards for accident prevention.  \n\nFIVE-YEAR ACCIDENT HISTORY\n\nWe keep records for all significant accidental chemical releases that occur at our facility.  The following is a brief summary of accidental chemical releases involving materials covered under EPA's RMP rule during the past five years:\n\nWe have had no accidental releases of under EPA,s RPM rule in the past five years.\n\n\nEMERGENCY RESPONSE PROGRAM\n\nWe maintain an Emergency Response  Plan, which consolidates  state and local regulator"

Our program provides the essential planning and training for effectively protecting workers, the public, and the environment during emergency situations. Furthermore, we coordinate our plan with the community emergency response plan.\n\n\nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nThe following is a list of improvements that we are planning to implement at the facility to help prevent and/or better respond to accidental chemical releases:\n\nThe site is currently completing a detailed independent audit of its PSM Programs, to evaluate further its prevention programs. Once this is completed (in 6/2004), a detailed prevention program safety improvement plan will be developed.\n\nAmerican Refining is proactive in Environmental, Safety and Health within the company. We are continuously improving our procedures and equipment. We also use audits, HAZOPs and inspections of equipment to aid in improving the environmenal, Safety and Health of our employees and communities in which we operate."
