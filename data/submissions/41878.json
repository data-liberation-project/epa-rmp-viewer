A District Safety Committee, comprised of individuals from each department, meets monthly to discuss safety issues and concerns, as well as performing safety inspections of all sites. Eagle River Water and Sanitation District also employs a Safety Officer full-time.\n\nThe UERWA Plant uses chlorine gas for disinfection of the community water supply. Due to the volume of water treated, it is required that we maintain a supply of two one-ton containers, or up to 4,000 pounds, of chlorine gas on-site. Chlorine is considered a toxic gas by the EPA, and is very harmful in large quantities in the air.\n\nThe Safety Officer conducts annual training to the Water Department regarding Haz Com, the use of emergency repair kits, and chlorine equipment safety. The Water Department has a detailed emergency response plan, which incorporates aspects of a recent vulnerability assessment. \n\nThere is a monthly inspection and test of the chlorine system, chlorine gas detection system, the alarm system,  and the chlorine scrubber system. The chlorine scrubber and all chlorine detectors were upgraded in 2004. \n\nThe Avon Fire Department's Hazardous Material Team, along with UERWA Plant operations staff, conducts joint training and planning on the handling of accidental releases of chlorine gas, and emergency response procedures. In the unlikely case of a catastrophic release of 2,000 pounds of chlorine, there is a possibility that an area 1.3 miles downwind of the water treatment plant could be affected. Depending on winds, this could include a significant portion of the Town of Avon. A catastophic release of a partially full chlorine tank, would likely effect less than  a one-mile radius. But, in both instances, the release is likely to be contained in the building. The chlorine storage room at the UERWA Plant is a sealed room containing a chemical-s"

Self-contained breathing apparatus, are used in this procedure, and in the event of a leak, it can be quickly contained with these safety considerations by trained personnel. \n\nDue to the safety measures in place, and the containment of chlorine in a specialized storage room, a catastrophic release is improbable. Nevertheless, the threat of a chlorine release is taken very seriously, and a contingency plan is in place. Employee involvement in our safety program, training aimed at proper handling of chlorine,  detection and neutralization systems in place, are intended to prevent accidental releases of chlorine in the future."
