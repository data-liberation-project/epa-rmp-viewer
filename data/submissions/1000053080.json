      "SummaryText": "Accidental Release Prevention Policy\r\nThe Osceola Water Treatment Plant (Osceola WTP) handles chlorine in an amount that is considered hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The same properties that make chlorine valuable as a disinfectant also require strict observance to certain safety precautions in order to reduce the threat to the employees and surrounding community.  Osceola WTP will utilize its Risk Management Program to identify ways to reduce its use of hazardous materials and minimize potential risks to its employees, the community, and environment.  Osceola WTP will comply with applicable safety, health, and environmental regulations; identify, report, and promptly correct unsafe conditions; train personnel to safely perform their job duties; and work to maintain a safe workplace.\r\n\r\nDescription of Stationary Source and Substance Handled\r\nOsceola WTP implemented a Level 3 Risk Management Program to prevent accidental release of chlorine gas from its Osceola, Iowa plant.  At this location, the WTP uses chlorine gas to disinfectant drinking water prior to its distribution to area residences, businesses and rural neighbors.  Chlorine gas, liquefied under pressure, is used in quantities that exceed EPA's regulatory threshold.  Chlorine gas is shipped by truck to the plant in 2,000-pound cylinders.  The chlorine gas cylinders are unloaded from trucks into the chlorine building, which is a separate from the main treatment plant building.  This building is equipped with an emergency air scrubber system to help comply with the EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with state codes and regulations.  \r\n\r\n5-Year Accident History\r\nWithin the last 5 years, no accidental releases of chlorine have resulted in death, injuries, or significant property damage on site, or known deaths, injuries, evacuations, sheltering in place, property damage or environmental damage, offsite.\r\n\r\nGeneral Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical Speci"

      "SummaryText": "fic Prevention Steps\r\nThe WTP relies on several safeguards as part of its accidental release prevention program.  The WTP's designers and suppliers use recognized design codes and standards for the equipment and system components that are installed; standard operating procedures specify safe practices used at the plant; a maintenance program establishes proper testing, calibration, and cleaning procedures.  Also, hazard communication takes place between management, operators, and employees during the process hazard analysis, process safety information reviews, training, safety briefings, and annual program reviews.\r\n\r\nEmergency Response Program\r\nAn Emergency Response Program has been implemented at the facility.  This program outlines the actions to be taken should there be an accidental chlorine release and provides guidance for the notification, response and evacuation of Osceola WTP's employees.  This program has been coordinated with the Osceola Fire Department.  The Emergency Response Plan acknowledges the LEPC as the emergency coordinators and recognizes the Osceola Fire Department as the first responders.  \r\n\r\nSafety Improvements\r\nThe facility strives for continual safety improvement at the WTP.  Some areas for planned improvement includes providing additional employee training regarding safe system operation and coordinating the emergency procedures, the facility layout and planned response actions with local Fire Department and LEPC on emergency procedures. This Risk Management Plan and information used to prepare it are readily available to all Osceola WTP employees."
