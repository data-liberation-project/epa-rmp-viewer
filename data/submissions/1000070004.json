The plant has a refrigeration system that uses anhydrous ammonia to freeze fish and seafood products. The ammonia inventory is more than 10,000 pounds, and in accordance with the OSHA and EPA requirements, we have developed a Process Safety Management and a Risk Management Program. There is a management system describing overall responsibility for the program and there is a person responsible for each element of the PSM/RM program. \n\n\n\nThe plant performed an initial Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) with employees to assist in making decisions for improving safety and reducing the consequences of unwanted or unplanned releases. In addition, at least every 5 years this process hazard analysis will be reviewed and updated. Every 3 years a third-party compliance audit will be conducted to review the PSM / RMP program elements for compliance with the regulation. \n\n\n\nThe refrigeration facility has been constructed following local, state and industry code requirements\n\nand guidelines. In addition, recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (REGAGEP) have been adopted through the application of standards provided by the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR). \n\n\n\nA Hazard Assessment has been completed which considers a worst-case ammonia release\n\nscenario as well as several alternate or more likely to occur accidents. This study has been used to\n\ndevelop the facility emergency action plan. There have been no accidents, injuries, or property damage resulting from an ammonia release in the last 5 years.\n\n\n\nIn the event of an ammonia release, the facility Emergency Action Plan would be implemented. The\n\nfacility first responders will provide proper measures to safely evacuate plant personnel to prearranged\n\nmuster areas. Appropriate community notification will be made for either emergency evacuation or p"
