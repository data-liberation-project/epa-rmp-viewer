If an emergency were to occur, it is our policy to notify the DeKalb County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.\n\nA description of our facility and the regulated substances handled: This facility is a coating and laminating paper plant.  We store, sell and distribute various laminated paper products. We store one regulated substance:  formaldehyde. There are two (2) 12,000 gallon storage tanks for formaldehyde.\n\nThe worst-case and alternative release scenarios:  For formaldehyde,  our worst-case release scenario is failure of two (2) 12,000 gallon aboveground storage tanks (ASTs) when filled to the greatest amount allowed (88% at 60 degrees Fahrenheit), resulting in a toxic chemical spill. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.   It should be noted that the actual release duration (240,771 minutes) could not be inserted into the RMP*Submit format.  Instead, the value 9,999 minutes was inserted into the RMP*Submit program for the  release duration.  Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.2 miles. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends offsite, and public receptors are within the distance to the endpoint.\n\n\nOur alternative release scenario considers the potential release of all of the formaldehyde contained in the ASTs (i.e., due to a 12.5 square inch diameter rupture of the AST), resulting in a toxic chemical spill. This scenario assumes that the release  occurs over a 60-minute period.  Therefore, our alternative release scenario modeled the release of a total of 60,000 pounds of formaldehyde. Utilizing RMP*Comp, the distance to the toxic endpoint was determined to be 0.1 miles. The resulting distance to the endpoint extends"

The formaldehyde  system is designed, installed, and maintained in accordance with industry standards and the state law.\n\nFive-year accident history:  We have never had an accident involving formaldehyde that caused deaths, injuries, property or environmental damage, evacuations, or sheltering in place.\n\nThe emergency response program:  In the event an emergency involving our formaldehyde system,  it is our policy to notify the DeKalb County Fire Department and request that they respond to the emergency.  Our facility also coordinates response activities with the DeKalb County Local Emergency Planning Committee(LEPC) located at 150 N.
