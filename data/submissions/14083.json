      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMartin Resources, Inc.\nPlainview, Texas\n\n\nAccidental release prevention and emergency response policies \n\nAt the Martin Resources, Inc. Plainview, Texas facility, we handle anhydrous ammonia, which is considered a hazardous toxic gas by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  It is necessary to observe certain safety precautions in handling anhydrous ammonia to prevent unnecessary human exposure, to reduce the threat to our own personal health as well as our co-workers, and to reduce the threat to nearby members of the community.  It is our policy to adhere to all applicable Federal and state rules and regulations.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle anhydrous ammonia combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility combined with the safe handling procedures that we use and the training of our personnel.\n\nWe at Martin Resources, Inc. are strongly committed to employee, public, and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of anhydrous ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the Plainview Fire Department to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.\n\nFacility description and regulated substances handled \n\nWe at the Martin Resources, Inc. Plainview, Texas facility use anhydrous ammonia in the manufacturing of ammonium sulfate, fertilizer pellets, and liquid fertilizers.  Anhydrous ammonia is delivered to our facility via rail car or truck transport and is stored in aboveground storage tanks at the facility prior to process use.  The maximum amount of anhydrous ammonia at our Plainview facility is administrativ"

      "SummaryText": "ely limited to 89% of the facility's capacity.\n\nThe regulated substance handled at our Plainview facility is anhydrous ammonia.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia that can be stored at this facility is 690,000 pounds in two 55,000-gallon, one 23,000-gallon, and one 12,000-gallon storage tanks. \n \nThe worst-case release scenario and the alternative release scenario, including administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the distances for each reported scenario\n\nThe EPA defines worst-case release scenario for toxic gases as the failure of our largest storage tank when filled to the greatest amount allowed.  The entire contents of the tank are assumed to be released as a gas over a ten-minute period.  Passive mitigation measures (e.g. enclosures) may be taken into account.  The toxic endpoint is the threshold for serious injury from exposure to a toxic substance in the air.\n\nThe worst-case release scenario as defined by the EPA is highly unlikely to occur.  In reality, a vapor release would not occur; some quantity of anhydrous ammonia would remain in liquid form.  During the evaluation, the scenario assumes none of the facility's mechanical controls or safety systems are operational, assumes no emergency response efforts take place, and assumes it occurs under the worst weather conditions.  \n\nTo evaluate the worst-case release scenario, we have utilized RMP*Comp the EPA recommended software.  The toxic endpoint for anhydrous ammonia is 0.14 milligrams/liter (mg/L) or 200 parts per million (PPM).  Based on 270,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia released, the distance the affects of a vapor cloud is expected to have no serious harm to the general public is 8.9 miles from the location of the storage tank.\n\nThe EPA states an alternative release scenario as a release that is more likely to occur than the worst-case scenario and will reach an endpoint off-site.  Active and passive mitigation systems may be considered for the alternative release scenario.\n\n"

      "SummaryText": "The alternative release scenario deemed most likely to occur at the Plainview facility is the failure of a flexible liquid transfer hose while transferring anhydrous ammonia from a rail car to the storage tank.  The flexible transfer hose is connected to iron piping.  Excess flow valves at the storage tanks and rail car function to stop the flow of anhydrous ammonia out of the storage tank and rail car.  Therefore, the anhydrous ammonia released would be limited to 600 pounds, the amount of anhydrous ammonia in the transfer hose and iron piping between the rail car and the facility's storage tanks. \n\nThe entire contents of the flexible transfer hose and iron piping will be released within the estimated time it would take facility personnel to identify a failure and implement actions to stop the release.  RMP*Comp estimates the distance to the point of dispersion to 200 PPM or to disperse enough to no longer pose a hazard to the public as 0.5-mile.\n\nThe general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps\n\nOur Plainview facility complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s Process Safety Management (PSM) rule, EPA's Accidental Release Prevention Rule and with all applicable state codes and regulations.  Our facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirements under 40 CFR part 68 of the EPA.  Additionally, our facility has implemented the provisions of Safety Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Anhydrous Ammonia, K-61.1, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and the standards of OSHA 29 CFR 1910.111, Storage and handling of anhydrous ammonia.  The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our stationary source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\nMartin Resources, Inc. maintains a detailed record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters, "

The methodology used to carry out these analyses is a What if/Checklist.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at least once every five years.  Any findings related to the hazard review are addressed in a timely manner.\n\n    Operating Procedures\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our anhydrous ammonia process, Martin Resources, Inc. maintains written operation procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown, and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the process.\n\n    Training\nMartin Resources, Inc. has a comprehensive training program to ensure employees are competent in the operations and procedures associated with the anhydrous ammonia process. \n\n    Mechanical Integrity\nThe Plainview facility carries out highly documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure proper operations.  Process equipment examined by these checks includes; pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls, and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel with previous training in maintenance practices.
