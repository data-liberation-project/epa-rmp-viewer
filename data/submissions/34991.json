Facility Accidental Release Policy\n\nThe owners, management, and employees of John Taylor Fertilizers Company, Roy Riegels Chemical Co., - Woodland facility (herein referred to as the Facility) at 1785 East Beamer Street, Woodland, California, 95695 are committed to the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia, and aqua ammonia.  If an accidental release should occur, the facility is prepared to work with the local fire department, or other authorities to mitigate any release and minimize the impact of the release to people and the environment.  A detailed emergency response plan has been developed and will be implemented in the event of an accidental release.\n\n2.  Facility Information\n\nThe primary activity at the Facility is the storage, and sale of fertilizers, in addition to, the sale of pre-packaged agricultural chemicals to farmers.\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received, stored, and distributed for direct application as a crop production nutrient.  \n\nAnhydrous ammonia is received by truck and stored in one 12,000-gallon storage tank (bullet) at the site.  The maximum quantity of anhydrous ammonia handled in this process is 48,000 pounds.\n\nAqua ammonia (25% of ammonia by weight) is stored in two 12,000-gallon and one 8,200-gallon above ground tanks at the site. The storage tanks are located within a secondary containment structure.  The maximum quantity of aqua ammonia handled is 241,500 pounds.  The total quantity of ammonia present in the aqua ammonia, based on 25% active ingredient by weight, is  60,375 pounds.  \n\n3.  The Worst-Case Release Scenario and Alternative Release Scenario\n\nIn compliance with the 40 CFR 68 revised 2004 regulations to the Clean Air Act, the description covering the worst-case release scenario has been eliminated from the executive summary.\n\n4.
