      "SummaryText": "ACCIDENTAL RELEASE SCENARIO AND RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nThe Indorama Ventures Olefins, LLC (IVOL) - Westlake, Louisiana is a chemical manufacturing facility and was acquired in 2015 from Occidental Chemicals. IVOL is completing a large-scale construction revamp of the asset with intent to start in late 2018. The site has a long-standing pledge to operate in a manner that is safe for workers, the public and the environment. IVOL has established a system to help ensure safe operation of the processes at the Westlake facility. This responsibility will continue to be exhibited by putting resources into assets for accident prevention. Example of this includes: training the workforce and considering safety in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of our processes. Our policy is to execute sensible controls to forestall predictable releases of hazardous substances. Nonetheless, if a release occurs, our trained workforce will respond to, control and contain the release.  \n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE STATIONARY SOURCE AND REGULATED SUBSTANCES:\n\nIndorama Ventures Olefins, LLC (IVOL) is situated at 4300 Hwy 108; Westlake, Louisiana 70669. The facility is owned by Indorama Ventures Public Company Limited. The site makes ethylene and propylene. The site holds 18 chemicals above the RMP threshold which includes 1, 3-butadiene, butane, 1-butene, butene, 2-butene-cis, 2-butene-trans, ethane, isopentane, isoprene, methane, 1, 3-pentadiene, pentane, 1-pentene, propane, vinyl acetylene, ethylene, propylene, and ammonia anhydrous.\n\nThe Westlake plant is subject to the Clean Air Act Title V permitting regulation and operates under Permit ID: 5773.\n\n\n\nGENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM STEPS\n\nFollowing is a synopsis of the general accident prevention program set up at IVOL.

Cases of employee participation go from updating and incorporating technical documents and chemical data to participating as an individual in process hazard analysis (PHA). Employees have access to all data associated with the site accident prevention program. Particular ways that the employees can be engaged with the accident prevention program are documented in the site's employee participation plan. Also, the facility has teams that address process safety and employee safety issues and that advance both process and individual safety. The teams commonly have individuals from different departments of the site, including operations, maintenance, engineering, and management. \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information:\n\nIVOL uses procedures to enable safe operation of the processes. These documents address chemical properties and related hazards, limits for key process parameters, specific chemical inventories, and equipment design basis information. Operational areas inside the site are required to keep the process safety information up-to-date. Chemical-specific data including specific hazards and emergency response/exposure treatment considerations are given in Safety Data Sheets (SDS). The SDS also addresses any known hazards related to the unintentional mixing of chemicals. The site has documented safety-related limits for particular process parameters (e.g., temperature, level, composition). The site will operate inside these limits utilizing process controls and monitoring instruments, highly trained professionals, and protective instrument systems (e.g., automated shutdown systems). Moreover, tables containing the outcomes of deviation from these limits and the corrective actions to make are promptly accessible.\n\nThe site likewise maintains technical documents that "

This data incorporates materials of construction, design pressure and temperature ratings, an electrical rating of equipment, piping and instrument diagrams, etc. This data, along with written procedures and trained personnel, gives a basis for establishing inspection and maintenance activities, and also to evaluate proposed process and site changes to guarantee that safeguards in the process are not compromised.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis:\n\nIVOL has a detailed program to ensure that the hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled. Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards. IVOL uses the HAZOP analysis study to perform these evaluations. HAZOP analysis is recognized as one of the most systematic and thorough hazard evaluation techniques.  The analysis is conducted using a team of people who have operating and engineering expertise.  This team identifies and evaluates hazards of the process as well as accident prevention and mitigation measures. The team will then make recommendations for prevention and/or mitigation measures when the team believes such measures are necessary.  \n\nThe site also conducts Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) studies in conjunction with the HAZOP studies. The LOPA study is a method for evaluating the effectiveness of independent protection layers in reducing the frequency and/or consequence severity of hazardous events. The LOPA provides specific criteria and restrictions for evaluation of independent protection layers, reducing the subjectivity of qualitative methods. \n\nThe HAZOP/LOPA team findings are reviewed by management for endorsement of the action plans.  A written action plan is generated by management assigning responsibility and determining an expected completion date for each accepted recommendation made during the study. "

The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained.\n\nTo help ensure that the process controls and/or process hazards do not eventually deviate significantly from the original design safety features, IVOL periodically updates and revalidates the hazard analysis results. These periodic reviews are conducted at least every 5 years and will be conducted at this frequency as long as the process is in operation. The results and findings from these updates are documented and tracked. Once again, the team findings are forwarded to management for consideration and the final resolution of the findings are documented and retained.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nIVOL maintains operating procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as (1) unit startup, (2) normal operations, (3) temporary operations, (4) emergency operations, (5) emergency shutdown, (6) normal shutdown, and (7) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are written and updated based on a document control process and provide a basis for consistent training of new operators. These procedures are periodically reviewed and annually certified as current and accurate. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the MOC (Management of Change) process.  \n\nIn addition, safe operating limits are maintained to provide guidance on how to respond to upper or lower limit exceedances for a specific processor equipment parameters.  This information, along with written operating procedures, is readily available to operators in the processing unit and for other personnel to use as necessary to safely perform their job tasks.\n\n\n\nTraining\n\nIVOL has a comprehensive OSHA Compliance training program for all employees.

The refresher training is conducted at least every 3 years. All training is documented and filed for all employees, including the means used to verify that the employee understood the training. Recommendations from the employees are reviewed and changes to the training program are implemented as appropriate.\n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nIVOL has well-established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, storage tanks, and piping systems in a safe operating condition. Also, relief or vent systems, control valves, pumps, and emergency shutdown systems are inspected and tested as required. The basic aspects of this program include (1) Inspection, testing and preventive maintenance (2) conducting training, (3) developing written procedures and plans, (4) Quality assurance and (5) Equipment deficiency management.

IVOL incorporates quality assurance measures into equipment purchases and repairs.  This helps ensure that new equipment is suitable for its intended use and that proper materials and spare parts are used when repairs are made. \n\n\n\nManagement of Change\n\nIVOL has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes. This system requires changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), procedures, and other site changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to (1) ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and (2) verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change. Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures, are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating and maintenance personnel is provided with any necessary training on the change.  The system ensures that all documentation is updated and training completed prior to the commissioning of the change and that temporary changes are in effect only for the required period of time.\n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nIVOL conducts a PSSR for any new site or site modification that requires a change in the process safety information.

Compliance audits are conducted at least every 3 years.  The audit team develops findings that are forwarded to site management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nIVOL promptly investigates all incidents that resulted in, or reasonably could have resulted in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance. The goal of each investigation is to determine the facts and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to site management for resolution. Corrective actions taken in response to the investigation's findings and recommendations are tracked until they are complete. The final resolution of each finding or recommendation is documented, and the investigation results are reviewed with all employees (including contractors) who could be affected by the findings.  Incident investigation reports are retained for at least 5 years so that the reports can be reviewed during future PHAs and PHA revalidations.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nThe site has safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.

IVOL has a procedure that addresses the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.252(a), and there is a Hot Work Permit Form to document job requirements, the dates for the hot work, and the object on which the work is to be performed. Employees are trained on the hot work permit procedure and Hot Work Permit Forms are audited to ensure that any errors in preparation or approval are identified and brought to the attention of those involved to prevent recurrence. \n\n\n\nContractors \n\nIVOL uses contractors to supplement its workforce during periods of increased maintenance or construction activities.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, the site has procedures in place to ensure that contractors (1) perform their work in a safe manner, (2) have the appropriate knowledge and skills, (3) are aware of the hazards in their workplace, (4) understand what they should do in the event of an emergency, (5) understand and follow site safety rules, and (6) inform site personnel of any hazards that they find during their work.  This is accomplished by providing contractors with (1) a process overview, (2) information about safety and health hazards, (3) emergency response plan requirements, and (4) safe work practices prior to their beginning work.  In addition, IVOL evaluates contractor safety programs and performance during the selection of a contractor.
