The program will help prevent the ocurrence of, the consequence of, catastopic release by stating our policies and procedures for the management of process hazard in the start-up, operation, maintenance and other matters addressed in the Federal Standards. Our program calls for maximum employees participation and includes all elements of the employee participation provision of the standards. We shall, as a minimum: (1) consult with the employees and their representatives on the conduct and development of the process hazard review and other elements of the risk management plan, and (2) provide to our employees and their representatives access to the process hazard review and all other information required to developed under that standard. At the 492 Water Treatment Plant we use chlorine as a disinfection; killing numerous waterborne pathogens that potentially resent in the raw water supply. It is our responsibility to protect the public from any type of waterborne pathogens, at the same time to observe certain safety precautions in handling chlorine to prevent unnecessary human exposure and to reduce the threat to our employees as well as to our nearby surrounding customers. Our policy is to apply by the Federal and State Rules and Regulations. Safety awareness and training is our primary action to protect our employees, while working around chlorine cylinders full, empty and connecting them."
