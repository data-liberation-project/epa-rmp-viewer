This Risk Management Plan takes our existing operation to the next logical step, to become responsive to the all encompassing chance of worst case senario.

Additionally, this plan strives to identify, and organize supporting transportation services for necessary evacuations.\n\nB.\tThis plan attempts to define who does what, when, where, and how, in order to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the effects of an accidental release or spill of Chlorine gas or liquid.\n\nII.\tSITUATION AND ASSUMPTIONS.\n\nA.\tSituation.\n\n1.\tThe City of Enid, Water Production Plant #1 is located at 1500 West\nChestnut, 249-4926.\n\n2.\tAreas of the City of Enid are potential exposures to the hazards of the accidental spill or release of Chlorine liquid or gas, due to the transporting, storage, and use of the one ton cylinders containing the Chlorine needed for the treatment of the City of Enid=s water.  Potential hazards which may occur in or around the city are, vehicle transportation of one ton Chlorine cylinders to and from water production plants in and around the city being involved in an accident.

It is also necessary to establish a system for the acquisition and effective use of available transportation in the City of Enid.\n\nB.\tConsiderations.\n\n1.\tThere are several factors which must be considered when planning for \nevacuation.  First among these are the characteristics of the hazard itself; \t            magnitude, intensity and duration.  These factors will help determine the boundaries of the area to be evacuated and available time.  Another consideration is the availability of evacuation routes, their capacity, and vulnerability to the hazard.\n\nIV.\tTASK ORGANIZA"
