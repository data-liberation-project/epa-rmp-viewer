All of these tanks are administratively controlled to hold and not exceed 85% of their capacity.\r\n\r\nIn our process we use the following chemicals that the EPA has identified as having the potential to cause significant offsite consequence in the event of a substantial accidental release:\r\n\r\nToxics\r\n\r\nNo toxic materials to report.\r\n\r\nFlammables\r\n\r\nPropane is delivered into two storage tanks via the dedicated propane pipeline.

The following are brief summaries of these scenarios, including information about the key administrative controls and mitigation measures to limit the exposure distances for each scenario.\r\n\r\nWorst Case Release Scenario \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\r\n\r\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Dubuque Terminal.\r\n\r\nAlternate Release Scenario(s) \u00bf Regulated Toxic Chemical\r\n\r\nThere are no regulated toxic chemicals to report for the Dubuque Terminal.\r\n\r\nWorse Case Scenario \u00bf Regulated Flammable Chemicals\r\n\r\nThis simulation involves the rupture or failure of the propane storage tanks resulting in a simulated vapor cloud explosion.

This scenario assumed the pump continued to operate at a rate of approximately 500 gallons per minutes (gpm) for 10 minutes after the line break.  The simulation calculated that 21,267 pounds of material were released in the assumed time frame.  Mitigation measures were taken into account when selecting the alternative release scenario.  These measures consisted of reviewing the use of relief valves, check valves, manual shutoff valves, automatic shutoffs, startup and operating procedures, grounding equipment, and excess flow devices.  Activation of the Emergency Shutdown Devices would isolate the source of the material and secure the facility.  All emergency response and early warning procedures to inform employees and the community would be exercised immediately if this were to occur.

The 9-1-1 system will be used to notify the Dubuque County Emergency Communications Center which will make notification to the local law enforcement and Fire Department(s).  Remote activation can also be accomplished from Enterprise\u00bfs Houston Control which has area video cameras with dial-up access.  In addition, there are local gas detection systems that alarm locally and in Houston Control.  If these detectors annunciate, the facility can be shut down remotely from Houston Control or locally by operations personnel.
