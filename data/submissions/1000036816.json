Specific ways that employees are involved in the accident prevention program are documented in employee participation plans that address each accident prevention program element.  In addition, FutureFuel has a number of initiatives underway that address process and employee safety issues.  These initiatives include FutureFuel's Leading Indicators Process which is a process for reporting safety concerns and ensuring that such concerns are addressed promptly.   Additionally, FutureFuel follows OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) to supplement its efforts for employee participation. The VPP lists guidelines for employee participation.  \n\n\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nFutureFuel keeps a variety of technical documents that are used to help maintain safe operation of the processes.  These documents address chemical properties and associated hazards, limits for key process parameters and specific chemical inventories, and equipment design information.  This information is normally compiled in a Process Safety Information (PSI) binder or filed electronically. The PSI and referenced documents are readily available to employees as part of the employee participation plan.\n\n\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nFutureFuel has a comprehensive Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) program to help ensure that hazards associated with the various processes are identified and controlled.  Within this program, each process is systematically examined to identify hazards and ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage these hazards before the manufacturing process begins.\n\n\n\nFutureFuel uses a PHA technique that is appropriate to the complexity of the process being studied.  There are four techniques in use at FutureFuel.  These are Check List, What If, What If-Check List, and Hazard and Operability Analysis.  The analyses are conducted using a team of people who have operating, maintenance, chemical, and engineering expertise and experience.  This tea"

These rankings help ensure  accident scenarios assigned the highest risk receive immediate attention.  All approved mitigation options being implemented in response to PHA Team findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented and retained for the life of the process.\n\n\n\nAll processes undergo a revalidation PHA at least every five years as long as the process is active.\n\n\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFutureFuel maintains written procedures that address various modes of process operations, such as: 1) unit startup, 2) normal operations, 3) temporary operations, 4) emergency shutdown, 5) normal shutdown, 6) initial startup of a new process.  These procedures are used as a reference by experienced operators and provide the basis for consistent training of new operators. The procedures are maintained current and accurate by revising them as necessary to reflect changes made through the Management of Change Process.  The Operations Superintendent certify these procedures annually as accurate.  The Process Safety Review Committee reviews them at least every five years.  \n\n\n\nTraining\n\nTo compliment written procedures for process operations, FutureFuel has implemented a comprehensive training program for all employees involved in operating a process.  Each new employee receives basic training in department operations.  After successfully completing this training, a new operator is provided training on process-specific duties and tasks.  This is done through an operator training program or by pairing the new operator with an experienced operator for an appropriate period of time.

Training is documented for each operator, including the means used to verify that the operator understood the training.\n\n\n\nContractors\n\nFutureFuel uses contractors to supplement its construction, maintenance and related services workforce.  Because some contractors work on or near process equipment, FutureFuel has procedures in place to provide contractors information on the hazards in their work area.  In addition, FutureFuel has a process for the selection of contractors and evaluation of their safety performance.  \n\n\n\nPre-startup Safety Reviews (PSSRs)\n\nFutureFuel conducts a PSSR for any new process, new facility or facility modification that requires a change in the process safety information.  The purpose of a PSSR is to ensure safety features, procedures, personnel, and equipment are appropriately prepared for startup.  This review provides one additional check to make sure construction is in accordance with the design specifications and supporting systems are operationally ready. \n\n\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nFutureFuel has well established practices and procedures to maintain pressure vessels, piping systems, relief and vent systems, controls, pumps and compressors, and emergency shutdown systems in a safe operating condition.  The basic aspects of this program include: 1) conducting training, 2) developing written procedures, 3) performing inspections and tests, 4) correcting identified deficiencies, and 5) applying quality assurance measures.  In combination, these activities form a system that maintains the mechanical integrity of the process equipment.\n\n\n\nSafe Work Practices\n\nFutureFuel has long-standing, documented safe work practices in place to help ensure worker and process safety.  Examples of these include: 1) control of the entry/presence/exit of support personnel, 2) lockout/tagout procedure to ensure isolation of energy sou"

These procedures (and others), along with training of affected personnel, form a system to help ensure that operations and maintenance activities are performed safely.\n\n\n\nManagement of Change (MOC)\n\nFutureFuel has a comprehensive system to manage changes to processes.  This system requires that changes to items such as process equipment, chemicals, technology (including process operating conditions), operating procedures, and other facility changes be properly reviewed and authorized before being implemented.  Changes are reviewed to ensure that adequate controls are in place to manage any new hazards and verify that existing controls have not been compromised by the change.  Affected chemical hazard information, process operating limits, and equipment information, as well as procedures are updated to incorporate these changes.  In addition, operating, maintenance, and contractor personnel are provided  necessary training on the change.\n\n\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nFutureFuel promptly investigates all incidents that result in, or reasonably could result in; fire/explosion, toxic gas release, major property damage, environmental loss, or personal injury.  The goal of each investigation is to determine the root cause and develop corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of the incident or a similar incident.  The investigation team documents its findings, develops recommendations to prevent a recurrence, and forwards these results to company management.

A specialized team from the HSE Department conducts these compliance audits.  Audit findings are forwarded to company management for resolution.  Corrective actions taken in response to the audit team's findings are tracked until they are complete.  The final resolution of each finding is documented, and the two most recent audit reports are retained.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the PSM required audits, FutureFuel conducts numerous internal safety inspections and HSES assessments.\n\n\n\nChemical Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe accident prevention program summarized previously is applied to all FutureFuel processes, not just RMP covered processes.  Collectively, these prevention program activities help prevent potential accident scenarios that could be caused by either equipment or human failures.\n\n\n\nFutureFuel also has safety features on processing units to help: 1) quickly detect a release, 2) contain and control a release, and 3) reduce the consequences of a release.  Some examples of safety features that compose the layers of protection at FutureFuel are gas detectors/analyzers, relief valves, scrubbers, automatic shutdown systems and containment areas.\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Program Information\n\nThe overall emergency response program for FutureFuel is coordinated with the Independence County Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  The LEPC includes local emergency response officials, local government officials, and industry representatives.

FutureFuel provides annual information and refresher training (more frequently if necessary) to local emergency responders regarding the hazards of regulated substances at FutureFuel. \n\n\n\nFutureFuel has a written emergency response program in place to protect employees, contractors, the public, and the environment.  The program consists of procedures for responding to a release of a regulated or non-regulated substance.  The procedures address the aspects of emergency response, including proper first-aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans, accounting for personnel after the evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, and the post incident cleanup and decontamination requirements.  In addition, FutureFuel has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment.  Employees receive training on these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties.  The emergency response program is updated when necessary based on modifications made to FutureFuel processes or other company facilities. \n\n\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nFutureFuel resolves all findings from PHAs, some of which result in modifications to the process.
