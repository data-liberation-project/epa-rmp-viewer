      "SummaryText": "Our company strives to maintain a safe and healthy work place.  Out farmer owners, managers, and employees have made every effort to plan the prevention of any accidental release of anhydrous ammonia.  This company is an agricultural retail business which specializes in grain storage for area producers, as well as providing the necessary inputs for grain production.\nOur plant consists of four anhydrous storage tanks, one 30,000 gallons and three 11,000 gallons, and 32 nurse trailers holding approximately 141,000 pounds, and when everything is filled to the 85% capacity, will hold approximately 417,000 pounds.  The worst case scenario may potentially release 79,000 pounds (over a ten minute periods) and has a distance to endpoint of 2.50 miles.  This release has the potential to affect 200 area residents.  \nThe alternative release scenario would have a release of 11,908 pounds over a two minute period.  This release would have a distance to endpoint of .83 miles and would still affect 200 people within the community.  \nThis company maintains and operates their NH3 plant in strict accordance with all federal, state, and local authorities.  The Kansas Department of Agriculture inspects our plant on a regular basis and we comply with their requests for improvement.  Our employees are trained in safety procedures, proper plant operation, plant maintenance, and the employees are competency tested over the training material.  Each employee uses goggles and gloves during ammonia operations as well as always providing plenty of safety water during nurse tank loading operations.  \nOn April 15, 2008, there was a belly valve failure that caused the release of 19,000 lbs of anhydrous.  The city of Iuka was evacuated as a precaution.\nOur Emergency Response Plan is designed to minimize the risks to employees, the surrounding public, and the area first responders.  This company provides plant tours for our local fire department and our plant has been shared with the county LEPC.  T"
