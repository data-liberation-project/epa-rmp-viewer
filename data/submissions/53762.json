(Sorrento) proactively uses the OSHA Process Safety Management program required under 29 CFR 1910.119, in conjunction with the additional off-site considerations addressed in 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an accidental ammonia release prevention program.  These documents are considered working documents by Sorrento Management, and are used by facility personnel as the procedural standards for preventing accidental releases of ammonia.\n\n          Emergency response policies for the Sorrento facility include an integration of the plans required under 29 CFR 1910.38(a) \"Emergency Action Plan\", 40 CFR Part 355 \"Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know\", 29 CFR 1910.119 \"Process Safety Management, and 40 CFR Part 68 \"Risk Management Program\".  The integration of these programs for the Sorrento Facility increases the usefulness of the emergency preparedness activities by decreasing the burden associated with maintaining multiple programs.  In general, Sorrento's performs minor emergency response measures with properly trained in-house personnel, however, local emergency response agencies handle all major emergencies.  Community notification policies are in place in the event of an emergency with potential off-site impacts.\n\n          The regulated stationary source is considered to be the entire Sorrento Cheese Company, Inc. facility located at 2375 South Park Avenue in Buffalo, New York.  The stationary source is involved in the manufacture of various cheese products.  Ammonia liquified under pressure is the only regulated chemical exceeding a threshold quantity under 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n         The accidental release prevention program integrates the OSHA Process Safety Management required under 29 CFR 1910.119 and the additional off-site considerations addressed in the 40 CFR Part 68 Subpart D, as an accidental release release prevention program.  One of the most important aspects of the prevention program is strict adherence"
