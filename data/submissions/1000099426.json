The goal of Part 68 is to prevent accidental releases of substances that can cause serious harm to the public and the environment from short-term exposures and to mitigate the severity of releases that do occur. In general, Part 68 requires that:\n\nFacilities must develop and implement a Risk Management Program and maintain documentation of the program at the site.  The Risk Management Program must include an analysis of the potential offsite consequences of an accidental release, a five-year accident history, a release prevention program, and an emergency response program.\n\nFacilities must also develop and submit a Risk Management Plan (RMP), which includes registration information, to U.S.EPA no later than June 21, 1999, or the date on which the Facility first has more than a TQ in a process, whichever is later.  The RMP provides a summary of the Risk Management Program.  The RMP will be available to federal, state, and local government agencies.\n\n\n\nCovered facilities also must continue to implement the Risk Management Program and update their RMPs periodically or when processes change, as required by the Rule.\n\n\n\nThe Kendall Power Company, LLC Facility (Facility), located at 1401 County Line Road in Minooka, Illinois (the Facility),[1] is a 1,100 megawatt combined-cycle power generation plant that includes four (4) gas turbines, four (4) heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs), four (4) reheat condensing steam turbines, and one wet-induced-draft cooling tower.

One process water storage pond at the Facility is used to store raw water for use as emergency backup water for Facility cooling, treatment, and maintenance operations.  Additional supporting structures at the Facility include various water tanks, electrical transformers, chemical tanks, and curbed and covered areas for boiler chemical feed systems.  Natural gas is the primary fuel to be used in the power generation process. \n\n\n\nTo protect the environment, aqueous ammonia is used at the Facility to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) pollutants which are generated from the combustion of natural gas.  Specifically, ammonia is the reducing agent used in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) NOx control systems.  The SCR is a post-combustion gas treatment technique that reduces nitrous oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the turbine exhaust stream to molecular nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O).\n\n\n\nThe Facility is committed to operating in a manner that is safe for site personnel, the community, contractors, and the environment.  To meet this commitment, systems have been established to help ensure safe operation of the processes of this Facility.  One component of these systems is the Risk Management Program that has been established and implemented to assist in managing the risks involved with the storage and use of aqueous ammonia, the only hazardous substances stored and used at the Facility that is regulated pursuant to 40 CFR 68.\n\n\n\n1.1    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response - 40 CFR 68.155(a), 40 CFR 68.155(c) and 40 CFR 68.155(e)\n\n\n\nAt the Facility, comprehensive accidental release prevention and emergency response programs have been established.

The Facility is committed to the safety of workers, contractors, the public, as well as to the preservation of the environment.

The measures include:\n\n\n\nEmployee training in accidental release prevention and emergency response programs/measures\n\nEstablishment of safety programs for Facility operations, design, and maintenance of the regulated process\n\nEstablishment of a hazard assessment process\n\n\n\nSafety depends upon the manner in which ammonia is managed at the Facility, combined with the safety devices inherent in the design of this Facility.

For control of NOx emissions, KPP stores and uses more than a threshold quantity (TQ) of 30% aqueous ammonia (CAS No. 7664-41-7), a regulated toxic substance (40 CFR 68.130, Table 1).  The aqueous ammonia solution is at a nominal 30% by weight concentration and is stored at ambient temperature.   \n\n\n\nThe process addressed in this RMP is transfer of the aqueous ammonia from the delivery tank truck, storage of aqueous ammonia in the storage tank, and transfer from the storage tank to the SCR and dilution systems. Nominal 30 percent (%) by weight aqueous ammonia is periodically delivered by a 5,"
