      "SummaryText": "The following provides a brief summary of the key components of the RMP for the aqueous ammonia storage and handling system at Longview.  \n\n1. General Description of the Facility and Regulated Substance\n\nThe Longview Power Plant located in Maidsville, West Virginia, is a coal-fired electric generating station operated by Longview Power, LLC.  Longview includes an electric generating unit with a 6,114 MMBtu/hour supercritical pulverized coal-fired generator (SB-1) equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) control system to reduce NOx emissions.  The SCR process injects a reducing agent into the flue gas duct to convert NOx to nitrogen over the presence of a catalyst.  The facility currently utilizes a 19% aqueous ammonia solution as a reductant for the SCR system; however, the facility is planning to start utilizing a 29.4% aqueous ammonia solution in the SCR system.  Aqueous ammonia is delivered to the facility in trucks and is stored in a common storage and handling system.  The storage system includes two horizontal aboveground, atmospheric 60,000-gallon storage tanks, pumps, and piping.  The tanks are equipped with overfill protection and vapor pressure relief devices and are located within secondary containment. The maximum amount of aqueous ammonia stored at this facility is 120,000 gallons or 898,721 pounds.\n\n2. Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nThe aqueous ammonia used for NOx control at Longview is considered hazardous by the USEPA.  The properties that make ammonia valuable as a reactant in SCR systems also necessitate certain safety precautions.  Longview strives to protect all of its valuable assets \u0096 both personnel and property.  To prevent exposure to personnel as well as nearby members of the community, existing natural resources, and the surrounding environment, Longview complies with all federal, state and local regulations.  Through continual, accurate training and various safety devices and procedures, Longvie"

Longview works in conjunction with the Monongalia County Emergency Management Agency to prepare for necessary notification of all affected neighbors. \n\n3. General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nUnder 40 CFR 68, Longview\u0092s aqueous ammonia storage and handling system is subject to the Program 2 Prevention Program.  The facility complies with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations.  These requirements include:\n\n\u0095\tDocumentation of safety information;\n\u0095\tPeriodic hazard reviews;\n\u0095\tDocumentation of operating procedures;\n\u0095\tTraining of employees;\n\u0095\tPreventative maintenance, inspection and testing of equipment;\n\u0095\tCompletion of compliance audits; and,\n\u0095\tIncident investigation.\n\nPlant personnel are trained about the prevention program elements.  Operation technicians receive classroom and on-the-job training to demonstrate proper job skills and knowledge.  Additionally, the ammonia system is operated, tested, and maintained to stringent industry standards. \n\n4. Five-Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has not experienced any accidental releases of aqueous ammonia in the past five years.  \n\n5. Emergency Response Program\n\nLongview facility personnel are not trained as first responders.  The Monongalia County Emergency Management Agency (M.E.C.C.A 911) is the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) for Monongalia County and is responsible for planning the coordination of first responders to disasters and emergencies, including hazardous material response.  Longview coordinates emergency with M.E.C.C.A 911.  In the event of a chemical spill, facility personnel are trained to contact M.E.C.C.A 911.\n\n6. Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nThe facility trains and tests all operation technicians who work on the aqueous ammonia system.  The plant preventati"
