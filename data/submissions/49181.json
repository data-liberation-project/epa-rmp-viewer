Only one discharge valve corresponding with pumping into either Tank1 or Tank2 is opened. These valves are provided with limit switches, which go    as inputs into the PLC. If Tank1 valve is opened, the PLC logic monitors the level switch of Tank1. When the level reaches 90%, the Ultrasonic level switch gets made and the PLC automatically shuts off the pump and suction valve. \n4)  Before connecting the hose, the operator inspects the couplings on the both ends for the integrity of the 0 rings. \n5)  Unloading is done strictly adhering to the Operating instructions, a copy of which is attached with this review. \n6)  All the piping is made of Schedule 80 rated PVC and conforms to generally acceptable good engineering practices. \n7)  The suction line to the unloading pump needed an additional support to prevent any accidental breaking of the pipe while connecting and disconnecting the hose. The same was provided. In the future it is planned to replace the suction line with a stainless steel pipe to improve the strength of the pipe. \n8)  The automatic suction valve is fail safe type, which gets closed in case of power failure or loss of air pressure. \n9)  Formaldehyde tankers shall only be unloaded in the daytime, never in the darkness.                            \n10)  In case of any abnormal situations, such as Leakage/Fire/Power failure, the operator gets the tanker outlet valve closed.

The Tank outlet valves are provided with Limit switches, which confirm opening and closing of the valves to PLC. The PLC requires one of the valves to be open for starting the pump. \n2) The Tanks and their outlet lines are made of FRP and appear to be in good shape. \nAll the piping was made of Schedule 80 rating PVC and conforms to generally acceptable good engineering practices. \n3) The IFA weighing system calls for a programmed load(normally 3000 kgs) of Formaldehyde into the measuring tank. The measuring tank weight is constantly monitored by loadcells. The maximum charge into the measuring tank is predetermined by the loadcells capacity and is programmed into the IFA weighing system. The values of these limits shall not be changed/increased. The measuring tank has been provided with a high level float switch. In case of any accidental overcharge beyond the normal limit, the float switch shuts off the operation of the measuring tank (i.e. shuts off the inlet valve to the measuring tank and the corresponding pump) indicating as a fault on the panel. This fault will not reset until the level is brought below the safe limit. During normal operation, the IFA system sends the signal to the PLC, which starts the pump and opens the measuring tank inlet valve. Once the programmed weight in the measuring tank is reached the IFA system automatically shuts off the pump and the valve. \n4) The process had Formaldehyde as the first charged component into the measuring tank and then into the Reactor. Any leaks in the flange joints or passing of outlet valves of the measuring tank / Reactor could lead to a hazardous situation. Hence it was decided to change the sequence of the components and take water as the first component. In case of any leakage, the further operations can be s"

The drain line is put into the ditch through a hose. In case of passing of the drain valve, the fluid flow is not visible. Hence it was discussed and decided to modify the drain line arrangement. A Tundish(Funnel like equipment with high side walls) shall be provided with the outlet drain line stopping just above the Tundish. The drain line of Tundish shall be put into the ditch. This would enable the operator to notice any passing of the drain valve. \n6) The operator shall make sure that the Water ring vacuum pump is started before the components charging is started. The Vacuum from the pump keeps all the vapors from Formaldehyde inside the reactor.  \n7) In case of any problems with the vacuum pump, the operator shall keep the reactor lid closed to prevent release of vapors into the atmosphere. \n8) The measuring tank inlet valve (automatic) is fail safe type, which gets closed in case of power failure or loss of air pressure. \n9)In case of any abnormal situations, such as Leakage/Fire/Power failure, the operator shall close the lid of the reactor. \n10)The personnel involved in the handling of Formaldehyde shall wash their hands with soap upon completion of the operation. \n\nThe above features were felt to be adequate for covering the foreseeable hazards in transferring the Formaldehyde into the Reactor. \n\nMaintenance \nMaintenance of the pumps, piping, interlocks, PLC, and instrumentation shall be done with good engineering practices.

Hence there is no change in the operating procedures. \n\n\n\nPrevious safety incidents while handling Formaldehyde \n1) No hazardous incidents took place at ATC Panels Biscoe, Inc., in handling Formaldehyde. \n2) A tanker with rear outlet was received in the past. The unloading area at GVK America is not leveled to accommodate a rear outlet tanker and hence cannot be unloaded fully. It was decided to reject all the tankers with rear outlet. A remark to this effect is included in the Purchase order. \n\nContainment \nCurrently, in case of any accidental release of Formaldehyde, it is collected in the covered ditch. An inflatable rubber cylinder (pig) is stationed at the entrance of the outlet pipe to Town effluent line. In case of Formaldehyde release, to prevent it to go into the town effluent system, the pig will be inserted into the outlet pipe and inflated with air pressure. \nThe above procedure was reviewed at the beginning of 2004 and in order to improve on the containment arrangement, a dike wall around the storage tanks and piping was constructed. The dike wall has a containment capacity of 110% of the Formaldehyde tank (25kl). A separate pump provides for the transfer of liquid inside the dike wall into a tanker or a tank. \nWith the above containment system, the foreseeable effect on the surrounding communities and local population, in case of catastrophic failure and accidental release of Formaldehyde was reduced, as the spill will be contained indoors. Personnel involved in carrying out the jobs connected with handling of Formaldehyde after any such emergency situation shall wear all the necessary PPE. \n\nVentilation \nAn exhaust fan is provided in the storage tanks room. The capacity of the fan enables approximately 7.8 air changes per hour. The calculation sheet for the same is attached herewith. It is felt to be adequate for exh"
