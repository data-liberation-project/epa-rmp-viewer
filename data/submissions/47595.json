Chemicals are stored in above ground tanks contained within concrete dikes.\nA?    All pipelines and vessels are built according to engineering standards using materials fit for the service.\nA?    Area monitors are used to detect releases of propylene and hydrocyanic acid, in order to prevent off-site release.\nA?    Scrubbers and flares are used to prevent release of toxics or flammables to the environment.\nA?    Sumps and concrete containment are used to prevent contamination of the ground.\nA?    Alarms and interlocks are used to prevent out-of-control conditions, which could lead to a release.\nA?    All operators have been trained and are certified under our Process Operator Training Certification (POTC) system.\nA?

The chlorine rail car is stored on it's own spur (rail), with a derail device installed to prevent entry of another car.\nA?    The car is grounded per D.O.T. regulations\nA?    The rail car is equipped with a double-lined carbon steel shell.\nA?    The tank car is visually inspected twice a day, at a minimum.\nA?    The perimeter of the loading station is monitored by 12 chlorine sensors, that are set to detect a release.  Activation of the alarms causes the valves on the unloading line to automatically close.\nA?    The rail car is equipped with an excess flow valve.\nA?    All operators have been trained and are certified under our POTC training system.\n\nThe following engineering and administrative controls have been implemented in the Acid Plant to prevent a release of oleum:\n\nA?    Both oleum storage tanks are equipped with high and \"high high\" level alarms. The alarms annunciate on the control panel.\nA?    Both oleum tanks are located within concrete secondary containment.\nA?    Both oleum tanks are protected from overpressure and vacuum by a conservation vent. Routine maintenance on the relief device is conducted every 24 months.\nA?    The oleum piping system is classified as a Class I system per our mechanical integrity program.
