Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies\n\nWe at Hampshire Chemical Corporation are strongly committed to employee, public and environmental safety.  This commitment is demonstrated by our comprehensive accidental release prevention program that covers areas such as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance, and employee training associated with the processes at our facility.  It is our policy to implement appropriate controls to prevent possible releases of all substances.  We are also coordinated with Nashua Fire & Rescue, which provides additional emergency response expertise.\n\n2.  The Stationary Source and the Regulated Substances Handled\n\nOur facility's primary activities encompass the production of industrial organic and inorganic chemicals.  The Facility falls under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) 325188 and 325199 and manufactures shampoos and sarcosines primarily on a batch basis.  The plant's entire chemical manufacturing process operations are located at one contiguous facility under common ownership and control.  The facility operates a 3-shift operation running 24 hours/day, Sunday night through Friday night.  We have six substances regulated by the Risk Management Program.  These substances include Hydrocyanic Acid, Formaldehyde (solution), Ammonia (anhydrous), Phosphorus Trichloride, Methylamine (solution) and Ammonia (aqueous). \n\nThe maximum inventory of Hydrocyanic Acid at our facility is 380,250 lbs.  The maximum inventory for 44% Formaldehyde solution is 324,000 lbs.  The maximum inventory for 40% Methylamine is 447,929 lbs.  The maximum inventory for Anhydrous Ammonia is 230,062 lbs.  The maximum inventory for 29.4% Aqueous Ammonia is 247,500 lbs.  The maximum inventory for Phosphorous Trichloride is 108,216 lbs.\n\n3.  The General Accidental Release Prevention Program and the Chemical-Specific Prevention Step"

The following sections briefly describe the elements of the release prevention program that is in place at our facility source.\n\nProcess Safety Information\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation maintains a record of safety information that describes the chemical hazards, operating parameters and equipment designs associated with all processes subject to our Process Safety/Risk Management programs.\n\nProcess Hazard Analysis\n\nOur facility conducts comprehensive studies to ensure that hazards associated with our processes are identified and controlled efficiently.  The methodology used to carry out these analyses include; Hazard and Operability Studies, Dow Fire & Explosion Index and Dow Chemical Exposure Index.  The studies are undertaken by a team of qualified personnel with expertise in engineering and process operations and are revalidated at a regular interval of 5 years.  The most recent PHA/update was performed on 11/08/01.\n\nOperating Procedures\n\nFor the purposes of safely conducting activities within our covered processes, Hampshire Chemical Corporation maintains written operating procedures.  These procedures address various modes of operation such as initial startup, normal operations, temporary operations, emergency shutdown, emergency operations, normal shutdown and startup after a turnaround.  The information is regularly reviewed and is readily accessible to operators involved in the processes.\n\nTraining\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation has a comprehensive training program in place to ensure that employees who are operating processes are competent in the operating procedures associated with these processes.  Refresher training is provided at least every 3 years and more frequently as needed.\n\nMechanical Integrity\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation carries out documented maintenance checks on process equipment to ensure pro"

Process equipment examined by these checks includes among others: pressure vessels, storage tanks, piping systems, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, controls and pumps.  Maintenance operations are carried out by qualified personnel trained in maintenance practices.  Furthermore, these personnel are offered specialized training as needed.  \n\nManagement of Change\n\nWritten procedures are in place at Hampshire Chemical Corporation to manage all changes in process chemicals, technology, equipment, procedures and personnel.  Process operators, maintenance personnel or any other employee whose job tasks are affected by a modification in process conditions are promptly made aware of and offered training to deal with the modification.\n\nPre-startup Reviews\n\nPre-start up safety reviews related to new processes and to modifications in established processes are conducted at Hampshire Chemical Corporation.  These reviews are conducted to confirm that construction, equipment, operating and maintenance procedures are suitable for safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation conducts audits on a regular basis to determine whether the provisions set out under our Process Safety and Risk Management Programs are being implemented.  The most recent compliance audit was conducted on 02/27-28/2001.  These audits are carried out at least every 3 years and any corrective actions undertaken as required.\n\nIncident Investigation\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation promptly investigates any incident that has resulted in, or could reasonably result in a catastrophic release of a regulated substance.  These investigations are undertaken to identify the root causes leading to the incident as well as any corrective actions to prevent the release from reoccurring. \n\nEmployee Participation\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation truly believes that process safety management and accident prevention is a team effort."

In addition, our employees have access to all information created as part of the facility's implementation of the RMP rule, including information resulting from process hazard analyses in particular.\n\nContractors\n\nOur company hires contractors to conduct specialized maintenance and construction activities.  Prior to selecting a contractor, an evaluation of safety performance of the contractor is carried out. Only contractors with acceptable safety programs are approved to perform work at the site.   Hampshire Chemical Corporation has a strict policy of informing the contractors of known potential hazards related the contractor's work and the processes.  Contractors are also informed of all the procedures for emergency response should an accidental release of a regulated substance occur.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation prioritizes accident prevention to ensure the safety of our operations.  These efforts have resulted with the minimization of accidental release in the past five years and the prevention of any impact on the community from any accidental release.\n\nThere has been only one accidental release of a regulated substance from our facility within the last 5 years that meets the criteria for the five-year accident history.  This release took place on 08/29/2000 and involved 2016 lb. of Formaldehyde (solution).  No deaths or injuries occurred offsite as a result of this accident.  Onsite, there was one injury.  There was some onsite property damage.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan\n\nHampshire Chemical Corporation has a written emergency response plan to deal with accidental releases of hazardous materials.  The plan includes all aspects of emergency response including adequate first aid and medical treatment, onsite evacuations and notific"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nSeveral developments and findings have resulted from the implementation of the various elements of our accidental release prevention program.\n\nSome of the steps we have taken to continue to improve safety at our facility include: adoption of The Dow Chemical Company's U.S. Area Safety Standards, adoption of Dow's Fire & Explosion Index Program and our Process Hazard Analysis work process, and reduction of on-site inventory of hazardous substances.  We intend to continue the reduction of hazardous substance inventories and to make process modifications, where practical, to reduce process risks."
