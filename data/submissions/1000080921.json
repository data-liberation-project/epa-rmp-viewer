Our plant manager has the overall responsibility for ensuring our facility operates in a safe and reliable manner.  This responsibility includes overseeing the implementation of the elements of our Risk Management Program (RMP).

Polyurethane foam is manufactured by combining specific ratios of chemical streams in a mixing chamber where the reacting ingredients are dispensed onto a moving conveyor system.  The reacting mixture cures into the form of a slabstock bun.  The foam buns are fabricated into spools, rolls, and other specialty parts.  Toluene Diisocyanate (TDI), which is regulated by the EPA's risk management rule, is one of the reactants required to manufacture polyurethane foam.  TDI is received at the plant by rail car and on rare occasions, by tanker truck; it is stored in nine tanks located in the contained bulk storage tank room.\n\n\n\nAccess to the site is restricted to authorized facility employees, management personnel, and contractors.  The maximum amount of TDI that can be stored at this facility is 566,127 pounds.\n\n\n\n3.    The general accidental release prevention program and the specific prevention steps.\n\n\n\nWe take a systematic, proactive approach to preventing accidental releases of chemicals.

Process controls also exist to minimize potential releases (e.g. tank level gauges, high level alarms, high-pressure switches, bursting disk, and system interlocks).\n\n\n\nThese listed individual elements of our prevention program work together to "

The Emergency Response Program\n\n\n\nWe maintain an integrated contingency plan, which consolidates the various federal, state and local regulatory requirements for emergency response planning.  Our program provides essential planning and training for effective protecting workers, the public and the environment during emergency situations.  We have coordinated our program with local emergency planning committee and the fire department.  The LEPC, SERC, and local fire department all have copies of an SDS for TDI and have copies of facility maps which identifies TDI unloading, storage, and handling areas. A representative of the fire department routinely visits our plants to discuss emergency response procedures.\n\n\n\nThe core elements of the emergency response plan identify detailed procedures and protocols to be initiated in the event of a release.  The following responses are addressed in our plan:\n\n\n\nProper Notifications in the event of a Release (internal and external)\n\nSystemic Shutdown of Operations\n\nEvacuation of Personnel\n\nFirst Aid Procedures\n\nEmergency Response Team Actions\n\nDecontamination of Personnel and Equipment\n\nManagement of Waste Material\n\nStart up of Operations\n\nAccident/Incident Investigations\n\n\n\n6.
