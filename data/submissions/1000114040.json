The following types of changes are examples of planned future risk reduction projects:\n\n1. Improvements to emergency isolation valves\n2. Improvements to fire protection systems\n3. Improvements to heater safety systems\n4. Improvements to relief valve protection\n5. Improvements to instrumentation systems\n6. Improvements to gas detection systems\n7. Improvements to operator shelters\n\nThe HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery is resolved to have a program of continued improvement for safety, reliability, and risk reduction investments. For example, various new installations over the last five years (2019-2024) have resulted in spending about $183,800,000 for East and West site projects improving safety, reliability, and fire protection."

The procedures address all aspects of emergency response, including proper first aid and medical treatment for exposures, evacuation plans and accounting for personnel after an evacuation, notification of local emergency response agencies and the public if a release occurs, post-incident cleanup and decontamination requirements. In addition, the HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has procedures that address maintenance, inspection, and testing of emergency response equipment, as well as instructions that address the use of emergency response equipment. Employees receive training in these procedures as necessary to perform their specific emergency response duties. The emergency response program is updated, when necessary, based on modifications made to refinery processes or other refinery facilities. Affected personnel are trained on the changes to the emergency response program.\n\nThe overall emergency response program for the HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery is coordinated with the Tulsa County - Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This coordination includes periodic meetings of the committee, which includes local emergency officials, local government officials, and industry representatives. The HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery has around-the-clock communications capability with appropriate LEPC officials and emergency response organizations (e.g., fire departments). This provides a means of notifying the public of an incident, if necessary, as well as facilitating quick response to an incident. In addition to periodic LEPC meetings, the HF Sinclair Tulsa Refinery conducts periodic emergency drills and involves both first responding groups as well as local community partners in emergency planning activities.
