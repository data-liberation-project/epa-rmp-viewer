      "SummaryText": "The Bellemeade Power Station is an electric utility generating facility, which burns natural gas and distillate oil to generate electricity.  It is required, by the terms of its air quality permit, to use Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are created during combustion.  The SCR system operates by injecting ammonia into the flue gas and passing the flue gas/ammonia mixture through a catalyst which causes the ammonia to react with NOx, converting it into nitrogen gas (a natural component of the atmosphere) and water.  This Risk Management Plan covers the storage and handling of ammonia.\n\nThe worst case release scenario is defined by EPA to be a rupture of the ammonia storage tank, with its entire contents being released.  Based on EPA's conservative method (RMP*Comp software) of calculating the consequenses of such a release, ammonia could travel as much as 3.6 miles before being diluted to the toxic endpoint.  Census data indicate that 72,000 people live within 3.6 miles of the site.\n\nA more likely release scenario is one in which a small hole (up to 0.4 inch diameter) developes in the tank, piping, or unloading hose, releasing liquid ammonia.  The toxic endpoint for such a scenario is 0.1 mile, and an estimated 36 people live within that distance of the site.  A second alternative scenario was examined, consisting of the opening and failure to reseat of a 2-inch pressure relief valve, or a rupture of a 2-inch pipeline carrying gaseous ammonia.  In either case, the toxic endpoint is 0.2 mile, and an estimated 233 people live within that distance.\n\nThe company's prevention program is based on OSHA's Process Safety Mangagement standard.  The facility has never had a reportable release of ammonia.  It does not (is not required to) have an emergency response plan meeting OSHA standards at 29 CFR 1910.120 (HAZWOPER); accidents that cannot be corrected immediately by employees who are within the immediate release are"
