      "SummaryText": "The City of Midwest City operates a wastewater treatment plant located in the northern section of Midwest City. The plant uses chlorine to meet fecal coliform limits for biologically treated wastewater that is discharged to Crutcho Creek and a constructed wetland. Safety is the number one priority at the wastewater plant, with chlorine being a significant potential hazard.\n\nIt is the policy of Midwest City\u00bfs Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to reduce, to the great extent possible, any hazards associated with the chlorine system and reducing any subsequent risk to the surrounding community, personnel, and environment. The Midwest City Wastewater Plant follows a strict operational, safety features in the chlorine system are performing according to standard.\n\nSafe operation depends on proper storage of chlorine, proper handing of the chlorination system, and the designed safety features of the chlorination system. Safe handing procedures and training of personnel are critical to achieving the required operational safety level. The maintenance program insures that all of the safety features in the chlorine system are performing according to standards.\n\nThe maximum inventory is four 1-ton cylinders. There are no more than two 1-ton cylinders in use at any given time. The worst-case scenario for the Midwest City Wastewater Plant would be the release of two cylinders resulting in an estimated toxic endpoint of 2.50 miles, with a release rate of 400 lbs/minute and a wind speed 5.4 m/sec. A worst-case scenario could affect up to 18,969 people around the Midwest City, and Oklahoma City, and/or Spencer area. The alternative scenario would be a failure related to one tank, such as the connection or valves.\n\nThe Midwest City HAZMAT team would be the first responders in the event of a catastrophic chlorine release. The Emergency Response Plan includes procedures for notifying the proper authorities, and those in the vicinity who would need to evacuate immediately"
