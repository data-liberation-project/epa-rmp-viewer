      "SummaryText": "Mt. Vernon Water Treatment Plant operates 24 hrs. a day serving most of Rockcastle County. The plant is classified as a 4-A plant, with four certified operators. The plant disinfects with chlorine about 2 MGD from Lake Liniville , average dose of chlorine 100 lbs per day. The chlorine is used to kill any algae,bacteria,and pathogenes that may be present. The water plant stores about 8000 lbs of chlorine in the \"chlorine building\" that sets aside from the main operation building.The chlorine is packaged in one ton-cylinders. The facility also has a set of scale that measures the amount of chlorine beening feed per day. There are two cylinders that sets upon the scales,only one is in use, but the other is on standby. The two cylinders are link together with a automatic vacuum switch, an manul shutoff valves. The gas line running from the cylinders goes through the floor outside throuth the main building, downstairs to the injector room. This injector room is were the operators adjust the lbs used per day . The facility has in use :alarms, detectors, vents, ammonia, scba,and a look through window before entery.\nThis R M P  has two chlorine release scenerio's \"worst case\",\" alternative case\". The worst case is defined as the owner or operator shall  asume that the maxium quantity is released as a gas over a 10 min. due to a unspecified failure.The alternative scenerio is defined as more likely to occur.\nThe modeling was used from the EPA's RMP*COMP(TM) for both scenerios. The worst case at the plant involves  a gas release of 440 lbs min, within 10minutes. THe end point is 1.9 miles with a estimated population of 2300 residents. Only the population within the plum extending downwind of the release point is potenally affected. The meteorological conditions, namely stability F, wind speed of 1.5 m/sec 77degrees and a average humidity. The alternative scenerio involves a pipe leak , the amount of chlorine released 500lbs within a 10 minutes period, with a end point of .3 a"

      "SummaryText": "n a estimate population of 100 residents. The meteorological conditions , stability D,with a wind speed of 3 m/sec.\nThe plant operators is trained on the job once a year before certification. To keep the certification in effect ,24 hrs of training is required every two years. Operators attend a yearly seminar an training courses to obtain the required training hrs. Training of the community response personnel, fire fighters are trained to the awareness level and 10% are trained to the operation level.\nIn the case of a release , radio station WRVK-AM (1460) will be utilized  to notify residents whether to evacuate or stay indoors for the duration . This will depend on the size of release and the travel. Also police, fire personnel will go door-to-door to insure the evacuation of all effected residents. Schools and churches will be used as sheltersif the necessity arise. The incident commander will autherized re-entry of evacuated areas.\nThe plants E R plan has been reveiwed by the LEPC. Exercises must be conducted on a four year cycle. Functional exercises must be conducted during 3 or 4 years, but a full scale exercise must be conducted during one year of the cycle. Local officals are encouraged to include hazardous materials problems in the exercise.\nThey have not been no accident in the past five years."
