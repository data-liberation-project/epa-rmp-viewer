Management and employees make safe operations and accident prevention the way of doing business everyday. For example, process safety information is discussed routinely.  Written follow-up reports from meetings help to ensure on-going safety.  A process hazard analysis has been conducted for these processes and findings have been documented, reviewed, and where needed, acted upon to ensure that procedures or design systems are modified to maintain a safe operation.  New operators will be trained on the operating procedures, health and safety issues, emergency operations, and applicable safe work practices.  In addition to operator training, all personel have been involved in awareness training, which reinforces the importance of safety at the facility.  The engineering firm designing this system has provided manufacturer information which, when entered into KU's computerized maintenance management program, allows for tracking and accountability.  This program ensures that on-going preventive maintenance issues are addressed before and occurrence.  A management of change procedure, which prevents substitution of parts, is part of prevention.  All employees are aware of the hazards when substituting parts of the wrong specification, which can lead to a serious ammonia release.  Compliance audits and incident investigations are conducted as required.  Employees are encouraged to participate in the safety process, which includes process reviews, training, and procedure writing.  Contractors are selected based on previous safety performance and practices.  In summary, the E.W. Brown Station and it's employees are committed to a safe operation of their facility to prevent the release of ammonia that could endanger personnel, public, and the environment.",

This program ensures that on-going preventive maintenance issues are addressed before and occurrence.  A management of change procedure, which prevents substitution of parts, is part of prevention.  All employees are aware of the hazards when substituting parts of the wrong specification, which can lead to a serious ammonia release.  Compliance audits and incident investigations are conducted as required.  Employees are encouraged to participate in the safety process, which includes process reviews, training, and procedure writing.  Contractors are selected based on previous safety performance and practices.  In summary, the E.W. Brown Station and it's employees are committed to a safe operation of their facility to prevent the release of ammonia that could endanger personnel, public, and the environment.",

Management and employees make safe operations and accident prevention the way of doing business everyday. For example, process safety information is discussed routinely.  Written follow-up reports from meetings help to ensure on-going safety.  A process hazard analysis has been conducted for these processes and findings have been documented, reviewed, and where needed, acted upon to ensure that procedures or design systems are modified to maintain a safe operation.  New operators will be trained on the operating procedures, health and safety issues, emergency operations, and applicable safe work practices.

      "SummaryText": "E.W Brown Generation Station, Kentucky Utilities, Mercer County, Kentucky, operates an inlet cooling system. This system uses approximately 32,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia in two separate ice thermal storage tanks. Engineers and company officials have reviewed relevant data from other existing systems to assist them with engineering design and mitigation techniques. This process is repquired to comply with 40 CFR part 68, Clean Air Act Amendments, Risk Management Plans. KU has developed a Risk Management and Process Safety Management Program to inform employees and management of the required procedures to maintain a safe operation.\n\n\n\nThis System is a closed-loop system with automatic shutdown activation. KU has trained process operators and emergency response team members should an emergency occur. Procedures that are in place to assist with quick mitigation of this type of release include: two operators performing this function so that if release occurs, isolation upstream can occur, radio communication to the control panel operator; trained emergency response personnel; and control panel operators recognizing a change in pressure. This process is also designed with an automatic shutdown system. Control panels will be monitored by trained personnel aiding in a quick response. Equipment used to process, store, and handle ammonia are designed, constructed, installed, and maintained to minimize the risk of releases.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, KU added a Selective Catalytic Reduction System to the Unit 3 coal fired combustion process.  The Unit 3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Process is a process which uses anhydrous ammonia in the presence of a catalyst to reduce nitrous oxides, a hazardous emission in the power plant flue gases, to form non-polluting nitrogen and water.  The BR3 SCR process consists of the following steps:\n\n\n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia, gas under pressure from its container, is delivered to the facility in a tank truck.  \n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia"

      "SummaryText": " is pumped from the transport vehicle into one of the two 34,000 gallon storage tanks.  \n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia is stored in the storage tanks.  \n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia is pumped from one of the storage tanks to the injectors.\n\n?    Liquefied anhydrous ammonia is fed through the injector into a dilution air flow.\n\n?    Pressure relief valves can vent small quantities of anhydrous ammonia gas when valves in the system malfunction.\n\n\n\nThe anhydrous ammonia Unit 3 SCR system is a series of interconnected vessels and piping, that store and pump anhydrous ammonia to the SCR injectors.  The injectors release the anhydrous ammonia as a gas into an air flow which is in turn, carried into the flue gases.  SCR equipment includes high pressure storage tanks, pumps, piping, instruments, controls, and valves. The quantity of anhydrous ammonia in the SCR system is estimated at 290,950 pounds when the system is completely (85%) filled. The anhydrous ammonia process begins with the delivery of the anhydrous ammonia at the facility until the anhydrous ammonia is converted into ammonia gas at the injectors.\n\n  \n\n\n\nKU's computerized maintenance management system enables personnel to provide continuous maintenance. The maintenance system is computerized and encompasses all phases of maintenance management including problem reporting, resouce scheduling, generation of prevention maintenance work orders, equipment database and complete equipment history. Safe operation of the system is a common goal for all E.W. Brown employees. This effort is supported through programs described previously and the involvement of plant management in development and implementation of the Process Safety and Risk Management Programs."
