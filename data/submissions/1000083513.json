The facility is located in Cass County, Clinton Township. The site is north of State road 25 and west of County Road 325 west. \n\n\n\nThe Clymers facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a staff of approximately 60 people.  The following operations are performed at this facility:  grain receiving and storage; hammer milling; fermentation; distillation, dehydration and evaporation (DDE); Corn oil extraction. Stillage and syrup is dried to produce DDGs (Dried Distillers Grain with soluble). The finished products are wet and dry distillers grain (WDGS / DDGS), corn oil, denatured ethanol, and E85 ethanol.  These products are shipped out via trucks and rail.\n\n\n\nThe plant receives corn by way of the pre-existing grain elevator or the new secondary truck dump at the ethanol plant.  Grain is stored temporarily in the concrete silos or steel grain bins, prior to being fed to four hammer mills where the corn is dry-milled into a powder and then conveyed to the production area.\n\n\n\nThe corn flour is mixed with water, enzymes, anhydrous ammonia and yeast; then is fermented to produce 13% ethanol beer.  The gases produced in fermentation are scrubbed with water to remove VOCs and then discharged to atmosphere. The beer is distilled to produce 190 proof ethanol and whole stillage. The 190 proof ethanol is dried to 200 proof and is denatured with gasoline to produce denatured ethanol and E85 ethanol finished products.  These products are shipped via rail or trucks.\n\n\n\nThe whole stillage is dried using evaporators and dryers to produce DDGs at 12% moisture or WDGS at 50% moisture.  DDGs is shipped via truck and rail.  The WDGS is shipped truck only.\n\n\n\nCorn oil is extracted from the whole stillage. It is shipped by truck and rail.\n\n\n\nRecuperative thermal oxidizers serve as the primary emission control devi"

The thermal oxidizers are very efficient at controlling particulates, carbon monoxide, VOC's, HAP's and nuisance odors.\n\n\n\nThe facility also has a water cooling tower for non-contact cooling water. Cooling is needed in distillation and fermentation. \n\n\n\nThe facility is protected from fire with a high pressure fire water loop and sprinklers in high risk areas.   Also there is a central fire detection and alarm system. In the process area there are detection and alarm systems for CO2, VOC, and anhydrous.\n\n\n\n\n\nRMP Applicability & Chemical Description\n\n\n\nThe two chemicals that require participation in the Risk Management Plan are anhydrous ammonia (CAS # 7664-41-7), and natural gasoline.  Anhydrous ammonia is used to control pH and supply nitrogen in the cook/fermentation process. It is stored outside in an 18,000 gallon storage tank near the center of the ethanol plant. When filled to the maximum 85% capacity, this tank can hold up to 15,300 gallons of anhydrous ammonia.  This material is a gas at ambient temperature and pressure.  It is a liquid when stored under pressure inside the tank.\n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is not a poison, but it is an inhalation / respiratory hazard. Ammonia is a toxic material but it has no cumulative effects on the human body.  However, it is acutely corrosive when it comes into contact with mucous membranes, in particular.   Anhydrous ammonia is a non-flammable gas.\n\n\n\nNatural gasoline is used to denature the ethanol.  Natural gasoline is a flammable mixture.  There are multiple constituents of natural gasoline however, based on analysis, four of those constituents, butane, pentane, neo-pentane or 2,2-dimethylpropane, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane are subject to the Risk Management Plan.  Butane makes up 0.806% of the natural gasoline, pentane makes up 24.518%, neo-pentane or 2,2-dimethylpropane makes up 0.237%, and iso-pentane or 2-methylbutane makes up 22.96%.\n\n\n\nNatural gasoline i"

Secondary containment consisting of compacted clay surrounds the tank farm.\n\n\n\nSummary of Release Scenarios\n\n\n\nWorst Case Release\n\n\n\nAmmonia: \n\nAs mentioned above, the storage tank has an 18000 gallon capacity, but when filled to 85%, it can only hold 15,300 gallons or 85,527 pounds of ammonia.   All deliveries are made by truck, which holds 20 tons (40,000 pounds) of ammonia.  The worst case release scenario would occur while the delivery truck is hooked up to the storage tank during the receiving process.   A truck is only ordered when the storage tank can receive the entire truckload.  So, 85,527 pounds of storage capacity - 40,000 pounds of empty space required to be able to order and receive a truckload of ammonia + 40,000 pound of ammonia on the delivery truck = 85,527 pounds of product that is capable of being released during the worst case scenario.\n\n\n\nA complete failure or burst of the ammonia storage tank, as represented by the worst case scenario, is highly unlikely.  The bulk storage tank was built in 2006 under strict guidelines established by the ASME pressure vessel code.  The National Board Certificate for the tank is on file.  The storage tank is protected by concrete traffic barriers.  All welding and structural work done on the tanks or appendages are performed by certified welders and stamped accordingly.\n\n\n\nNatural Gasoline:\n\nThe worst case release scenario would be a total loss of a full tank of natural gasoline resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  The storage tank capacity is 235,000 gallons or 1.3 million pounds.  Of the 1.3 million pounds, 615,885 pounds are made up of the materials subject to the Risk Management Plan.\n\n\n\nAlternative Release\n\n\n\nAmmonia:\n\nThe most likely causes of ammonia emergencies are ruptured hoses and defective valves, as represented by the alternative release scenario.

The audits include a physical walk through of the entire facility and a review of all EPA, OSHA and DOT paperwork and training documentation.  Action items are noted and recommendations are made. The audits consist of five major topical areas:  Safety & Health, Environmental, Fire Protection & Security, Administrative and Housekeeping & Storage.  Issues are documented in a report and sent to the facility manager and upper management.  Updates on action item status must be made regularly.\n\n\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) has been performed at this facility, as part of the Pr"

Hoses are date-stamped and replaced by the transporter or The Andersons in advance of the expiration date or when defects are observed.  All transfers of ammonia are directly observed by the delivery truck driver.  Transfers of anhydrous ammonia from the storage tank to the processing building occur inside fixed steel pipes and area automated from the control room.  No hoses are utilized in the operation.\n\n\n\nUnder normal circumstances for the alternative scenario, the amount released would not be based on the total volume of both vessels.  Instead, it would be limited by the volume of the delivery truck.  The plumbing at the storage vessel receiving bulkhead has backflow preventers which would prevent the tank from emptying its contents if a transfer hose ruptured.  Therefore, the product that would be released would have to come from the delivery truck.  \n\n\n\nAnhydrous ammonia is supplied by a tanker truck, which holds 20 tons (40,000 pounds) of product.  Product is transferred via rubber hoses to the storage tank at a rate of 1,000 pounds / minute.  The truck has an excess flow valve and the receiving system at the tank also has one.  Typically, a release would immediately trigger the excess flow valves to slam shut.  However, if the release was too slow to trigger the excess flow valve, it would continue to leak until the transfer system could be shut down.  Over the course of a ten-minute period, approximately 10,000 pounds (10 minutes x 1,000 pounds) of ammonia would be released.\n\n\n\nNatural Gasoline:\n\nThe most likely cause of a natural gasoline emergency is a release during a delivery due to a faulty hose or valve resulting in a vapor cloud explosion.  Deliveries are made by railcar and pumped into the storage tank.  Deliveries are typically 30,000 gallons or 166,000 pounds of which 78,600 pounds are RMP materials.\n\n\n\nAll unloads are made during business hours and are observed by f"

The loadout area where deliveries occur has a catchment basin with underground piping to secondary containment.\n\n\n\nExplanation of How Ammonia Releases are Prevented\n\n\n\nAmmonia:\n\nPassive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that function without human, mechanical or energy input.  The passive mitigation systems in place include:\n\n\n\nBulkhead breakaway units located on the connection point between the delivery truck and the storage tank plumbing.  If a truck driver were to drive off without disconnecting from the tank, the concrete structure would cause the hose to shear off from the plumbing.  At this point, active mitigation would take effect and an excess flow valve, just inside the breakaway barrier, would prevent the tank from emptying into the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nActive mitigation refers to equipment, devices or technologies that require human, mechanical or other energy input to function.  The active mitigation systems in place include:\n\n\n\nExcess flow valves are located on all outgoing liquid and vapor valves on both storage tanks.  They close automatically if the volume of gas or liquid flowing through the line exceeds the normal flow rate.  They won't reopen until the downstream shutoff valve is closed and the pressure equalizes on both sides of the valve seat.  Two principal causes of the excess valve closing are a ruptured hose or a broken pipe or shutoff valve downstream that is opened too quickly.\n\n\n\nBack check valves are located on the unloading lines of delivery trucks and are designed to ensure that the flow goes in one direction only.  This prevents anhydrous ammonia from flowing back to the transport tank from the storage tank.\n\n\n\nPressure-relief valves are located on the top of the bulk storage tanks, fixed steel piping and on the vaporizer to relieve pressure that is too great.  This can be caused by elevated temperatures in the summer or"

This stops the flow of ammonia by remote activation of a spring loaded valve.\n\n\n\nAn ample supply of water is available near the bulk storage tank from a nearby water tank and a water hydrant to help knock down a vapor cloud.\n\n\n\nSpill control kits are located at the facility and include sorbent material, shovels, PPE and disposal containers.\n\n\n\nDeliver truck drivers supervise all anhydrous transfers to and from the bulk storage tank\n\n\n\nNatural Gasoline:\n\n\n\nPassive Mitigation\n\nThe natural gasoline storage and unloading areas are equipped with secondary containment.  Material released from unloading will stay in the concrete secondary containment pad.  Electrical equipment in the tank farm area is rated for Class 1 Division 1 to prevent any leakage from being ignited by electrical equipment. \n\n\n\nActive Mitigation\n\nHot work in the unloading area and tank farm is strictly controlled by hot work permits.
