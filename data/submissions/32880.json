To protect the lives of plant personnel and the constituents within the zone of influence.\n2. For the purpose of mitigating personal injury.\n3. To minimize damage to property and the environment.\n\nThere is a Safety Committee that meets periodically to coordinate safety programs. The facility has two employees that are trained to the First Responder Technician Level in accordance with the HAZWOPER regulations. These two refrigeration technicians can assist the local emergency response team in the event of an incident.\n\nStationary Source and Regulated Substance\n\nLocation of Valley Fruit facility is 12 Hoffer Road in Wapato, Washington. Engine Room #1 was constructed in 1988 and Engine Room #2 was constructed in 1995.\n\nThe facility uses ammonia as a refrigerant for the cold storage of agricultural products. A mechanical refrigeration system is a closed system that cycles the refrigerant, ammonia, from liquid to gas and back again. As the refrigerant absorbs large amounts of heat from the source, the refrigerant changes from liquid to gas. At a different part of the system, the refrigerant releases heat as it is condensed back into a liquid.\n\nThere are two separate ammonia refrigeration systems. Engine Room #1 contains a maximum intended inventory of ammonia of 10,700 pounds. Engine Room #2 contains a maximum intended inventory of ammonia of 19,500 pounds.\n\nAccidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention Steps\n\nThe facility has a safety committee, responsible for the safe operation and handling of ammonia. Practices and procedures for proper ammonia handling are obtained through annually Emergency Response Training that is specifically targeted toward ammonia refrigeration safety. In addition to plant safety policies for the safe handling of ammonia, there are ammonia gas detectors in the cold storage"

These sensors activate an automatic dialer system and Engine Room detection notification at 50 ppm to notify the front office, Production Manager, and Refrigeration Engineer.\n\nFive Year Accident History\n\nThe facility has had no reportable releases of ammonia during the last five years (June 1999 - June 2004).\n\nEmergency Response Program\n\nThere are two trained emergency responders at the facility in order to assist the local emergency response team in the event of a release. These two responders are the refrigeration technicians who have received an initial 24 hour training program with 8 hour annual refresher training specifically relating to ammonia refrigeration safety. In the even of an emergency, the facility plans to call 9-1-1 and evacuate the buildings.\n\nPlanned Changes to Improve Safety\n\nResults of the Process Hazard Analysis of the ammonia refrigeration system are being assessed to reduce the risk of ammonia releases."
