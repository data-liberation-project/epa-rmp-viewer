In addition, FG Waldo operates this facility in accordance with our internal standards that employs good engineering practice and industry accepted principles and codes. FG Waldo has instituted operating and training procedures that are designed to provide a safe work environment and protect our neighbors.\n\n\n\nFG Waldo operates a propane facility adjacent to a rail spur. It is comprised of one RMP covered process involving propane. The primary purpose of this facility is to distribute propane to wholesale customers. All propane is delivered to the facility by railcar, pumped into bulk tanks and then pumped into trucks. No other RMP regulated substances are handled at this facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Plan:  \n\n\n\nFG Waldo coordinates emergency response with the local Fire Department to deal with accidental releases of propane. We have coordinated our activities for emergency planning and our facility is included in the community emergency response plan.  FG Waldo does not perform emergency response as defined by EPA RMP rules. Our Employees perform incidental response, which is limited to actions that can be safely taken to stop or prevent a minor release of product. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevention Program:  \n\n\n\nOur facility has taken all the necessary steps to comply with the accidental release prevention requirement set out under 40 CFR part 68. This facility was designed and constructed in accordance with NFPA-58 Standard. The elements of the release prevention program that are in place at our facility include Safety Information, Hazard Review, Operating Procedures, Training, Mechanical Integrity Program, Compliance Audits, and Incident Investigation.
