      "SummaryText": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE POLICIES\n\nHilmar Cheese Company uses anhydrous ammonia for two refrigeration systems for the production and cool storage of cheese products.  Ammonia is the only hazardous chemical used at this facility that is subject to the CalARP program or federal RMP requirements.\n\nThis facility recognizes the hazards associated with the use of highly hazardous chemicals.  As a reflection of our policy to adhere to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, we submit this plan to address the hazards inherent with the use of ammonia.  Our program addresses safety precautions regarding the handling and operation of this covered system as well as proper training for those who operate and maintain the system.  The company training policy requires that all employees will be properly trained for a job position before assignment to that job.\n\nOur accidental release prevention program is clearly defined by the OSHA Process Safety Management (PSM) Program for this facility.  This prevention program follows industry-recommended standards for preventing unnecessary human exposures and reducing the threat to the health of our employees as well as to members of the community and the surrounding area.  Safety depends upon the manner in which we handle these chemicals, the safety devices inherent in the design of this facility and its processes, and the training that we provide our personnel.  This Plan is updated as required by law.\n\nOur Emergency Action Plan (EAP) details the response this facility will take as a result of a release, or impending release, of ammonia.  The Plan includes procedures for notification of the local emergency responders.  This EAP also includes a specific protocol for responding to an ammonia release and assigns an Emergency Coordinator to implement the response.  This Plan is current and updated as required by law and conforms to the requirements for an Emergency Action Pl"

The facility lies to the west of State Highway 160 (Lander Avenue) north of the town of Hilmar and north of August Avenue.  The facility is situated in an area comprised primarily of agricultural lands, light commercial and office areas, and residential areas.\n\nThis facility manufactures and stores cheese products for wholesale distribution.  The facility areas include offices, production buildings, a wastewater treatment facility, parking, a visitor\u00c2\u00bfs center, warehouses, loading/unloading docks and areas, raw material tank storage, and two ammonia refrigeration systems.  The facility operates seven days per week throughout the year.  \n\nRegulated Substance Handled\n\nThis facility utilizes anhydrous ammonia as the refrigerant in each of these two systems.  The new system is called the Cold Storage System, while the existing system is called the Production System.  Each system is a single-stage mechanical refrigeration system.\n\nCompressors provide suction and compression for the systems to operate.  The heat of compression in the high-pressure compressor discharge is removed in the evaporative condensers.  Each condenser drains high-pressure liquid to its respective system high-pressure receiver for screw compressor cooling and/or recirculator package liquid ammonia as required.  Liquid from the recirculator is pumped to the evaporators as needed"

All pressure vessels in the systems have dual safety relief valves (SRV's) to protect the respective vessel against overpressure conditions.  All SRV's on the Cold Storage System relieve to an ammonia diffusion tank via a common discharge piping system.  An auto purger removes non-condensibles and air as required to maintain efficient refrigeration processes.\n\nEvaporator piping and valve trains are located on the roof and the evaporators are defrosted with hot gas from the high stage discharge line.\n\n \nTHE GENERAL ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM AND THE CHEMICAL SPECIFIC PREVENTION STEPS\n\nThis facility complies with the California Accidental Release Prevention (CalARP) Program and OSHA\u00c2\u00bfs Process Safety Management (PSM) Program.  Key prevention steps taken by this facility to maintain safety are outlined in the PSM Program in the CalARP Program manual.  These steps include the description of all system and equipment information, process hazard analysis, operator training, contractor qualification, operating procedures, pre-startup safety review, hot work permitting, management of change, mechanical integrity, incident investigation, compliance audits, and emergency response.\n\nThose who operate, maintain, or monitor the system will be trained to understand the principles of ammonia refrigeration and ammonia properties, an understanding of the process equipment and proper operating and maintenance procedures, recognition of abnormal conditions and the steps to correct deviations, and emergency shutdown procedures as appropriate to the level of involvement each employee will have with the process.  Contractors that perform maintenance or that design changes to the system will be qualified by the facility based upon their experience and safety record before being selected to provide such services.\n\nThe general safety program includes hazardous communicatio"

The Emergency Action Plan includes release notification for emergency responders and the procedures for evacuation.  The Emergency Coordinator implements the response in coordination with the local emergency responders (i.e. the fire department).  The Emergency Coordinator is also trained to the OSHA Incident Command level.  It is the policy and practice to conduct evacuation drills regularly.\n \nPLANNED CHANGES TO IMPROVE SAFETY\n\nA Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) was performed as required for the Production System in 2004.  A PHA was conducted for the new Cold Storage System process and completed in May 2006.  Each PHA team developed a list of recommendations to improve safety by reducing potential hazards of the process. All recommendations were implemented, deemed unnecessary since no improvements to safety would result, or planned for implementation at a later date.\n \nAn Update and Revalidation of the previous PHAs was performed in April 2011. The study team evaluated the potential hazards of the systems and developed a list of recommendations. All recommendations were considered and implemented, deemed unnecessary since no improvements to safety would result, or planned for implementation at a later date. \n\nUpcoming events include:\n\n\tThe addition of an auto-dialer system for the Cold Storage system to notify technicians/ management of any issues with the ammonia system."
