Diagrams, drawings and written information specific to the process is maintained on site.\n\nProcess Hazard Analyses - A PHA was conducted, deficiencies identified and corrections scheduled and/or implemented.\n\nOperating Procedures - SOPs, SMPs, PMPs were developed and implemented for all activities relating to the process and prepared in accordance with OSHA and EPA guidelines.  They are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary to remain consistent with the process.\n\nTraining - Employees initially undergo an extensive 6-month appreticeship with specific training, both classroom and on the job, in all phases of the process.  Refriesher training is provided every 3 years or more frequently if necessary.\n\nMechanical Integrity - An extensive maintenance program for all components has been implemented.  Thorough inspections, (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) are performed and deviations or deficiencies corrected immediately.  Standard Maintenance Procedures (SMPs) and Preventative Maintenance Procedures (PMPs) have been written for all maintenance and inspection activities and are reviewed annually to ensure that they are current.\n\nManagement of Change - There is a written management of change procedure in place.\n\nPre-Startup Reviews - Are conducted any time the ammonia refrigeration system or its components are opened for repairs, tie-ins or modifications.  A checklist has been developed and is used to ensure safe startup prior to placing equipment into operation.\n\nCompliance Audits - Audits will be conducted every 3 years and corrective actions required as a result of the audits implemented immediately.\n\nIncident Investigation - There is a program in place to promptly investigate any incident that resulted in, or had the potential for, an accidental release of ammonia.

Each is dedicated to the prevention of product releases and subsequent potential injuries to themselves, their coworkers, the surrounding community and the environment.\n\nContractors - A procedure for reviewing the safety performance and past safety history of any contractor hired to work on or with the anhydrous ammonia refrigeration system has been developed and will be followed.  The policy includes an obligation to inform the contractor of the hazards they and their workers will be exposed to as well as emergency response procedures.  A performance evaluation system to ensure that the Contractor adheres to the company safety and health policies is contained within the procedures.\n\n4.  Five-year Accident History - there have been no ammonia releases in the past five years.\n\n5.  Emergency Response Plan - In the event of a discharge, employees would control the leak from a safe distance and perform only those activities supporting outside emergency response personnel that would be outside the danger zone.  The Cape Canaveral Fire and Rescue would be contacted immediately and provide spill response.  Evacuation procedures are in place and would be initiated if necessary.  The plan has been coordianted carefully with the Cape Canaveral Fire and Rescue.\n\n6.  Improved Safety - The facility and all employees involved in the process will continue to inspect and examine all components of the system to identify areas where improvements can be made.  All deficiencies noted on audits, inspectiosn and daily observations will be corrected and recommendations based on PHAs implemented immediately."

The release prevention program addresses such issues as design, installation, operating procedures, maintenance and training to ensure that releases do not occur.  Frequent inspections, regular maintenance, process monitors, rigorous supervised on-the-job training and 24 hour surveillance fof the process reduce the likelihood of an accidental release.  If a release does occur, however, employees are trained to contain the spill from a safe distance and implement notification procedures.  Emergency response activities are coordinated with the Cape Canaveral Fire and Rescue Services located within minutes of the facility.\n\n2.  Regulated Substance\n\nThe facility is a cold and dry storage warehouse and anhydrous ammonia is used as cooling material in a closed system.  There is approximately 12,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia within the system and it is the only regulated substance at the site that exceeds the threshold quantity.  Due to the amount of product and the location of public receptors, the facility is covered as a Level 3 facility under RMP regulations and is also subject to the OSHA PSM Standard, 29 CFR 1910.119.\n\n3.  Accidental Release Prevention Program\n\nThis facility has developed all prevention program elements based on the Federal EPA's Accident Release requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 68 and OSHA's Process Safety Management (PSM) standard.\n\nProcess Safety Information - The facility was designed and constructed in accordance with codes and standards that in some instances is no longer appli"
