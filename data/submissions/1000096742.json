One component of these efforts is the risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68.\r\n1.\tAccidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (\u00a768.155(a)): Protecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, and of the surrounding environment, is our top priority, and we have a comprehensive program in place to reduce risks associated with our process.\r\nHazard Assessment and Reduction - We regularly assess the risks associated with the use of isobutane in our manufacturing processes and seek out ways in which to reduce those  risks.\r\nAccident Prevention - We engineer and construct our manufacturing processes and equipment to minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases. We also provide our employees with extensive training in the safe operation of those processes and equipment.\r\nEmergency Action - We have developed an OSHA Emergency Action Plan. This plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting. Depending upon a given situation, the Marysville Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment and for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated the hazards of isobutane with the Marysville Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).
