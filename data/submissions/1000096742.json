The facility maintains approximately 83 full time employees.\n\nProtecting the health and safety of our employees, neighbors, and the surrounding environment is our top priority. One component of these efforts is the risk management program (RMP) that helps manage the risks involved with using hazardous substances at our facility and that complies with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulation 40 CFR Part 68.\n\n1.    Accidental Release Prevention and Emergency Response Policies (?68.155(a)): Protecting the health and safety of our employees and neighbors, and of the surrounding environment, is our top priority, and we have a comprehensive program in place to reduce risks associated with our process.\n\nHazard Assessment and Reduction - We regularly assess the risks associated with the use of isobutane in our manufacturing processes and seek out ways in which to reduce those  risks.\n\nAccident Prevention - We engineer and construct our manufacturing processes and equipment to minimize the possibility of accidental chemical releases. We also provide our employees with extensive training in the safe operation of those processes and equipment.\n\nEmergency Action - We have developed an OSHA Emergency Action Plan. This plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms and alerting. Depending upon a given situation, the Marysville Fire Department will be called to provide emergency responders and equipment and for all fire related emergencies. The facility has communicated the hazards of isobutane with the Marysville Fire Department and the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). The incident commander has ultimate control of the implementation of the emergency response.\n\nOur internal emergency communications program ensures that all supervisors and employees in areas affected by an"

Stationary Source and Regulated Substances (?68.155(b)):\n\nPregis Marysville is a processing plant located at 2700 Willis Street in Marysville, MI. The facility utilizes isobutane as a blowing agent in foam manufacturing and stores isobutane at the facility.\n\n3.    General Accidental Release Prevention Program and Chemical-Specific Prevention (?68.155(c)):\n\nPregis Marysville is a Program 3 facility. RMP*Comp and EPA's OCA Guidance were utilized to calculate the worst case and alternative release scenarios, respectively, for the foam extrusion process, which includes the storage of isobutane. The RMP identifies the impact to the surrounding community in Sections 4 and 5 of the plan.\n\n4.    Five-Year Accident History (?68.155(d)):\n\nThere have been no reportable incidents during the past five years. However, the facility maintains records of all incident investigation reports regardless of the amount of isobutane released into the atmosphere.\n\n5.    Emergency Response (?68.155(e)):\n\nWe have developed and implemented an OSHA Emergency Action Plan for isobutane. The plan outlines specific procedures for evacuations, incident alarms, and alerting. The emergency action plan includes procedures for:\n\na) Informing the National Response Center (NRC), LEPC, Fire Department, Police, etc. about accidental releases that could reasonably result in offsite consequences.\n\nB) Providing proper first aid and emergency medical treatment for accidental human exposure to isobutane.\n\nWe have an Emergency Action Program that identifies the actions to be taken during an emergency, and the Plant Manager is in charge of coordinating emergency actions as the Incident Commander. Our personnel are trained in evacuation procedures. The EHS Manager is responsible for apprising the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) of the emergency, and the LEPC is responsible for notifyi"

Planned Changes to Improve Safety (?68.155(f)):\n\nWe constantly strive to improve the safety of our processes using recommendations developed through the prevention program and a program soliciting safety suggestions from our employees under our Safety Concern Program.  Based on the most recent (June 2021) Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) for isobutane, a list of action items was developed. The status of these action items will be monitored to ensure that implementation of the safety improvements is accomplished."
